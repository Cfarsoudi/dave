          EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN
          
          A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles
          circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
          
          A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE
          COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to
          shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves
          OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.
          
          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          She throws water on her face as the music continues. She
          looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.
          She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.
          The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she
          smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
          Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS
          is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see
          much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's
          important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the
          following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                      Walter...time for school, honey.
          
          She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.
          
                                WALTER
                      Just ten more minutes --
          
                                CHRISTINE
                      Sorry, champ.

                               CHRISTINE (Cont'd)
                     You can sleep in all you want
                     tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are
                     for. Now hurry up or your breakfast
                     will get cold.
          
                               WALTER
                     It's cereal, it's supposed to be
                     cold.
          
          She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits
          on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.
          
          EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING
          
          A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the
          street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's
          and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.
          
          INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in
          her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to
          an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that
          only a few other kids have arrived.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     We're here, sweetie.   Come on.
          
          She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward
          the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the
          school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as
          Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.
          
          She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it
          rumbles away.

          
          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
          Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room
          is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy
          wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening
          and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
          
          Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created
          by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator
          to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns
          at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane
          toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Okay Sandy, what's the prob--
          
          The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.

                               OPERATOR
                     You deal with this one, I'm not
                     going near it.
          
          Christine struggles on the headset.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor,
                     ma'am, what can I --
                         (checks board)
                     Yes, I can see that you're on a
                     party line, ma'am, what can I --
                         (beat)
                     I know, it's unfortunate, but people
                     sometimes do listen in on party
                     lines. We hope to have private
                     lines installed by --
                         (beat)
                     Well, what's he doing when you're
                     on the phone?
                         (beat)
                     Are you sure? Maybe there's a
                     problem with the phone line. He
                     could be asthmatic, or --
                         (beat)
                     Oh. No, I...I've never heard of
                     anything like that before either.
                     Guess there's a first time for
                     everything, right? No, I'm afraid
                     there's nothing we can do about
                     people abusing the equipment or...
                     themselves. I'm sorry. I --
          
          She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end
          as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Everything all right?
                               CHRISTINE
                     Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just
                     someone having a problem with a...
                     with the connection.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Tell them to take the plug and shove
                     it in and out a few times, that'll
                     usually do it.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Unfortunately that was part of the
                     problem. If you'll excuse me....
          
          She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another
          pink sheet of paper.

          EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY
          
          Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick
          telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.
          
          Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees
          gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine
          closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up,
          we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows
          indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.
          
          She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again.
          She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
          
          Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings,
          announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among
          them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Hey, sport.
          
                                  WALTER
                     Hey, mom.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     So how was school?
          
                                WALTER
                     Okay. We learned about dinosaurs,
                     and I got in a fight with Billy
                     Mankowski.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What happened?
          
                                  WALTER
                     He hit me.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you hit him back?
                         (he nods)
                     Good. Rule number one: Never start
                     a fight, but always finish it. So
                     why did he hit you?
          
                               WALTER
                     Because I hit him.
          
          She stops, looks at him.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Wait...you hit him first?
                          (he nods)
                     Why?

                               WALTER
                     He said my dad ran off because he
                     didn't like me.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Your dad never even had a chance to
                     meet you...so how could he not like
                     you?
          
                               WALTER
                     Then why did he leave?
          
          Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Well, the same day you were born,
                     something else arrived. It came in
                     the mail, in a box just slightly
                     bigger than you. You know what was
                     in that box?
                         (he shakes head)
                     Something called responsibility.
                     Now, to some people, responsibility
                     is fun, it's what you live your
                     whole life for. Other people think
                     it's the scariest thing in the world.
          
                               WALTER
                     So he ran away because he was scared
                     of what was in the box?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yup.
          
                               WALTER
                     That's dumb.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's what I thought.
          
          She turns and crouches down in front of him.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Walter, I decided a long time ago
                     that I would always tell you the
                     truth, that I would treat you like
                     a grown-up. I can't expect you to
                     respect me unless I respect you.
                         (beat)
                     I've never lied to you. Your father
                     leaving had nothing to do with you,
                     and everything to do with what was
                     in the responsibility box.

          She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug.    He smiles.

                     First one to the corner store gets

          He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him
          stay ahead of her the whole way.
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which
          is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine
          enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her.
          
                               WALTER
                     Did I miss Amos and Andy?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I'm afraid so, sport.   Come on now,
                     time for bed.
          
          She picks him up and carries him up the stairs.
          
                               WALTER
                     Are we still going to the movies
                     tomorrow?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie
                     Chaplin playing down at Grauman's,
                     and a new serial called The
                     Mysterious Airman.
          
                               WALTER
                     Who's that?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know. Nobody does. That's
                     what makes him so mysterious.
          
                                WALTER
                     Oh.   Am I too heavy for you to carry?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Not for years yet, Walter.     Not for
                     years.
          
          And she disappears upstairs.

          INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          She's getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room
          when the phone rings. She hesitates, then picks it up.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 10, 1928
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Hello?
                         (beat)
                     Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine,
                     thanks. No, I was just --
                         (beat)
                     You're kidding. When did she call
                     in sick?
                         (checks watch)
                     What about Myrna? I know she could
                     use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's
                     just...I promised Walter I'd take
                     him to the movies today. There has
                     to be somebody else....
                         (beat)
                     All right, I...guess we can do it
                     tomorrow. I'll get there as soon
                     as I can. But just until four,
                     okay? See you in a bit.
          
          She hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out
          of it. She straightens and heads out of the room.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts
          things together quickly.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     There's a sandwich and milk in the
                     icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley
                     if her daughter can stop by in a
                     couple of hours, just to --
          
                               WALTER
                     I can take care of myself.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Of course you can. She's coming by
                     to check on the house, not you.
          
          She stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies.
                     Then we'll ride the Big Red down to
                     Santa Monica and walk on the pier.
                     How's that? That okay?

                               CHRISTINE (Cont'd)
                         (he nods)
                     Good. I'll be back before it gets
                     dark.
          
                               WALTER
                     I'm not afraid of the dark.     I'm
                     not afraid of anything.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I know you're not, honey. That's
                     how I raised you.
                         (kisses his head)
                     Be good. See you in a bit.
          
          She heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her.
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - CONTINUOUS
          
          She crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back
          as Walter looks out at her from the window. She waves. He
          waves back. With one last look, she continues off.
          
          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
          
          If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines
          buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine
          around with papers and question.
          
                               OPERATORS
                     We've got lines jammed from here to
                     Ohio...he insists on talking to
                     someone in charge...I've tried
                     everything and the console's just
                     dead...I need your signature here
                     for a supply requisition....
          
          Christine glances up at the clock, 4:39.    She's already late.
          But she does what's necessary.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     All right, get me the Omaha routing
                     station, see if we can put the calls
                     through their switchers...and let's
                     get that console running....
          
          She hurries off to take care of it all, the others following.
          
          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - LATER
          
          START on a clock which reads 5:20, then TILT DOWN as Christine
          comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready
          to leave...as the floor manager steps out of his office.

                               MR. HARRIS
                     Christine...good, I was hoping to
                     catch you. I've been following
                     your work reports, and I just want
                     you to know that I'm very impressed.
          
          She glances down the block. The street car is approaching,
          but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     When I first suggested hiring female
                     supervisors, my superiors weren't
                     big on the idea. But you've held
                     your own as well as any of our male
                     supervisors, and --

                               MR. HARRIS
                     Ben, please. Point is, we're looking
                     for someone to take on a managerial
                     position in our new Beverly Hills

                               CHRISTINE
                     That's great, Mr. Harris, I really
                     appreciate the vote of confidence.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Good, good...so maybe we could --
          
          She looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
                     We'll talk on Monday. Good night!
          She races out to
          
          EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - CONTINUOUS
          
          running after the streetcar as it closes its doors.

                     Wait...wait...hold on, just a --
          
          But the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it.
          Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly.
          
          INT. STREET-CAR - EARLY EVENING
          
          Christine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows
          lengthen, then pulls the bell. The car rumbles to a stop as
          she steps out onto the sidewalk.

          EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING
          
          She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and
          continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street.
          We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner,
          radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming.
          Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house --
          
          -- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music
          or dramas on the radio. Dead silent.
          
          Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic,
          he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house,
          where the lights wouldn't show.
          
          She goes to the front door.     It's unlocked.    She enters --
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          It's dark, silent.    She puts her purse down.     Looks around.
          
                                   CHRISTINE
                      Walter?
          
          Nothing.   She goes into
          
          INT. KITCHEN
          
          switching on lights as she goes. Nothing. She checks the
          refrigerator. The sandwich she made Walter is untouched.
          She moves to the staircase.
          
                                   CHRISTINE
                      Walter...?
          
          INT. WALTER'S ROOM
          
          She opens the door to his room.      No Walter.
          EXT. COLLINS HOUSE
          
          She crosses to the sidewalk.     Looks up and down the street.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                      Walter?   Honey? Time to come in.
          
          A little GIRL on a tricycle rolls past.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                      Susie honey, have you seen Walter?
          
                                   GIRL
                      Nuh-uh.
          
          The girl continues away. Christine's concerned, but she hasn't
          hit the panic button, not yet. She crosses the street to --

          forties, emerges.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                        Mrs. Riley, I'm sorry to bother you
                        at dinnertime, but I was wondering
                        if Walter was here.
          
                                  MRS. RILEY
                        No, I'm afraid not.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                        Do you know if Jamie was able to
                        look in on him?
          
                                  MRS. RILEY
                        Well, I mentioned it to her, but
                        she was going to a dance with some
                        of her friends...you know how
                        teenagers are. Is everything all
                        right?
          
                                   CHRISTINE
                        I'm sure it's fine, I just...
                            (beat)
                        Thank you, Mrs. Riley.
          
          Christine heads away.
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Christine stops at the sidewalk in front of her house, looks
          up and down the street, arms folded against the growing chill.
          
                                     CHRISTINE
                        Walter...?     Walter....
          She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees
          and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She
          hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace,
          homing in on the sound.
          
          She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of
          them Walter. She looks down the ominously empty streets.
          
          Her worry growing, she heads to the house.       Faster now.   Heels
          clicking on the hard sidewalk.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
          
          She bursts in, leaving the door open, looking around in case
          he came in while she was out. Nothing. She crosses to the
          phone, hesitates for just a BEAT, then picks up the receiver.

          There's a long pause as she waits, looks out the window, then:

                     put second to greed and personal
                     gain. Every day, the city sinks
                     deeper into a cesspool of fear,
                     intimidation and corruption. Once
                     the City of Angels, Los Angeles is
                     now a place where our protectors
                     have become our brutalizers...where

          Christine walks past the door to his bedroom. Looks inside.
          Goes over to the bed. Her hand lingers, touching it, UNDER:

                     Of course.
          
          He smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't
          think Walter's coming back. It's been too long. She senses
          it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering

          Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins
          to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier.
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     Well...I'll leave you to it, then.
          
          She nods as he exits, then heads off herself.
          
          INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - LATER
          
          Christine moves from station to station, the noise level still
          noticeably low. Every time she approaches an operator, they
          lower their voices, as if not to bother her.
          
          One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts
          toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor
          and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this,
          she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Excuse me, can I have your attention?
          
          The room grows quiet.   Everyone is looking at her.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Listen, everyone, I appreciate your
                     consideration, but I'm not made of
                     porcelain. I won't break down and
                     cry if the station to station call
                     to Kankakee doesn't go through.
                         (a thin smile)
                     Actually, I...promised myself that
                     I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself
                     cry...until I knew, one way or

                         (beat)
                     Point is...I like the noise here.
                     So don't be afraid to talk and...push
                     buttons, and drop things. If it
                     wasn't noisy, how would I know I
                     was in the right place?
          
          She manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal.

          A hang-up, then dialing.   He glances in the open doorway.
          
          Christine sits at a table, phone in hand, a list of phone
          numbers in front of her. The list reads LAS VEGAS MISSING

          She puts a check next to LAS VEGAS MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT
          then looks up as someone answers at the other end of the phone.

                     all the lines of communication are
                     working. I mean, that's what I do
                     for a living, right?
                         (beat)
                     Well, I'll try back next week. If
                     you do hear anything in the meantime,
                     would you be sure to let me know?
                     Thanks. Goodbye.
          
          She hangs up and ticks another department off the list and
          dials again. Mr. Harris heads away, deciding that whatever
          it was he planned to talk to her about...it can wait.

          The Man reaches for his wallet.   Pats an empty pocket.   Tries
          the other pocket. Nothing.
          
                               MAN
                     Hell...looks like I left my wallet
                     at home. Can I owe it to you?
          
                               COOK
                     No credit. Pay up or I call the
                     cops. I'm tired of bums like you
                     coming around here.
          
                               MAN
                     I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.
                     I just left my wallet at home, that's
                     all. I'll go back and get it.
                     Five, ten minutes tops.
          
          The Cook hesitates; he doesn't want the trouble of bringing
          in the cops, but he doesn't want to get stuck, either.
          
                               COOK
                     You got any collateral?
          
          The Man glances at the Boy seated beside him.   The boy's face
          is dirty, partially obscured by the hat.
                               MAN
                     Can't ask for better collateral
                     than a man's own flesh and blood,
                     right?
                         (to the boy)
                     You stay here, son, I'll be right
                     back.
          
                               BOY
                     But --
          
                               MAN
                     Now don't give me any trouble.
                     He's a good man to trust us like
                     this. You just sit here while I go
                     get my wallet. Okay?

          The boy nods reluctantly, looks away as the man rises.
          
                                COOK
                      Ten minutes, then I'm calling the
                      cops.
          
          The Man nods, exits and drives off.     The Cook squints warily
          at the Boy, then at the wall clock.     It's 2:00.
          
          EXT. DINER - LATER

          INT. DINER - ON CLOCK
          
          It's 3:15. The Cook is annoyed.      He glances to the Boy, who
          won't meet his gaze. Finally:
          
                                COOK
                      Ah, hell....
          
          He goes to the phone.    Clicks the receiver a few times.
          
                                COOK
                      Hello, Myrtle? It's Harve, down by
                      the diner. Would you get me Sheriff
                      Larsen? Yeah, I'll wait.
          
          He casts a sour look in the boy's direction.
          
                                COOK
                      What's your name, son?    Son...?
          
          The boy takes a BEAT, looking out at the road.    Then:
          
                                BOY
                      I don't remember.
                                  COOK

          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
          
          As before, Christine hurries from one station to another,
          lost in the barely-managed chaos. She stops at one station,
          glancing over papers, then looks over at --
          
          -- the window to Mr. Harris' office, where he is talking with
          a police officer, CAPTAIN J. J. JONES, 30s, serious, arch.
          
          She slows, unable to look away, a growing dread settling in
          her heart. Harris points out the window. Points...to her.
          The police captain nods and enters the switchboard room.
          
          As Jones heads for her, the strength goes out of Christine's
          legs. She holds onto the a desk as he stops before her.

          She manages a nod. Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going
          to tell me my son is dead. The room gets very quiet.
          
                               JONES
                     My name is Captain J. J. Jones,

                     He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was
                     picked up two days ago by local
                     police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's
                     safe and unhurt. He was in the
                     company of some drifter, we've got
                     an APB out for him now, and --
          
          But she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt. She
          almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying
          and embracing her.
          
          For the first time, Christine cries, great wracking sobs, all
          the emotion she's been fighting back all this time coming out
          at last...he's okay...he's okay.

          EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
          
          Jones and Christine are in a police car pulling up to the
          train station. It moves through a police line holding back a
          crowd of reporters who SHOUT questions at the passing car.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     All these reporters...you didn't
                     tell me --
          
                               JONES
                     Yours is a story with a happy ending,
                     Mrs. Collins. People love happy

                     We'd better get a move on.
          
          As Christine and Jones step out, they're mobbed by the press.
          Jones smiles splendidly for the cameras, waves, one arm wrapped
          around Christine, who looks stunned by it all.
          
                               JONES

          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Seated on a bench is a POLICE MATRON, and beside her, the BOY
          from the De Kalb diner...who we will identify henceforth as
          "Walter." He is looking out the window at the passing scenery.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Did you know that Los Angeles is
                     where they make the Tom Mix movies?
          
                               MATRON
                     No, I didn't.
          
                                "WALTER"
                     His horse is named Blue.
                         (beat)
                     You think they'll let me watch them
                     make a movie?

                     But with all this attention, who
                     knows, maybe they will.
          
          The boy turns his attention back out the window as we HEAR
          the WHISTLE of the train pulling into Union Station.
          
          INT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
          
          We HEAR the same train whistle from this side as Christine
          and Jones come to the ramp, POLICE CHIEF DAVIS is waiting.
          The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce
                     you to Chief of Police James E.

                     attention from the boys in the press

          But she's distracted, looking off to the end of the platform,
          where the train is starting to pull in.
          
                               DAVIS
                     I take it you've been treated well
                     by my boys in the department?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Oh...yes, of course, they've been
                     great. Well, there was that part
                     about having to wait twenty-four
                     hours before filing a report, but --

                     Technicalities aside --
          
          The train stops.    Doors begin to open.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes...other than that, no complaints.
                     They've all been wonderful.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Good, then you won't have any problem
                     telling that to the press, and how
                     the LAPD is concerned first and
                     foremost with the safety of --
          
          But she's already running down the platform as people start
          to step off the train. Jones exchanges a look with Davis.
          
                                 JONES
                     Women.    Just a sec....
          
          He trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside
          the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager.
          
          Then: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily
          blocking the view of the boy beside her...but Christine spots
          them. With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Walter...Walter!
          
          She runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and
          gets out of the way, revealing the boy.
          
          Christine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She
          steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. For a moment,
          we're not sure what's going through her mind. She looks to
          the matron, who smiles. Looks to the boy, who smiles.
          
          Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes
          jauntily alongside her.

                     He's not my son.
          
          Jones freezes at the words.
          
                               JONES

                     I'm...I'm sure you're mistaken.
          
                                 CHRISTINE

                     He's been through four long, terrible
                     months...he's gone through changes,
                     lost weight --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I know my own son.
          
          He glances over his shoulder to where the Chief of Police is
          waiting, not aware of any of this, and beyond him...the press.
          
                               JONES
                     I'm just saying...I mean, you're in
                     shock, and he's changed, and --
          
          He turns from her, stoops down to look at the boy.
                               JONES
                     What's your name, son?   Can you
                     tell me your name?
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Walter Collins.
          
          Christine steps back as though slapped.     This can't be.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It's a common name, it --
          
                               JONES
                     Do you know where you live, Walter?
                     Do you know your home address?
          
          The boy considers for a moment...then:
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                   24.
          
          
                                "WALTER"
                     My house is at 210 North Avenue 23,
                     Los Angeles, California.
                         (beat)
                     And that's my Mommy!
          
          And he RUNS to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only
          magnifies her horror. Jones has no idea what to make of her,
          or this, or the boy. The only thing he knows is that the
          chief of police is standing right over there, smiling now
          that he thinks he's seen a mother and child reunion. The
          press is nearly insane trying to get through to them.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins...listen to me. I
                     know you're feeling uncertain right
                     now, but that's to be expected...a
                     boy this age changes so fast...but
                     we've compensated for that in our
                     investigation. We're experts in
                     child identification. There's no
                     question that this is your son.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It's not Walter.
          
                               JONES
                     It's not Walter as you remember him.
                     That's why it's important for you
                     to take him home, on a...trial basis.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     A trial basis?
          
                               JONES
                     Once you've put him back in familiar
                     surroundings, and given yourself
                     time to recover from the shock of
                     his changed condition...you'll see
                     that it is him. I swear to you,
                     Mrs. Collins. I give you my word.
                     Trust me...this is your son.
          
          She looks from him to the boy...who is not terribly dissimilar
          from Walter...so that even the audience may not be entirely
          sure if it's him or not...and part of her wants desperately
          to believe...the pressure is immense.
          
                                JONES
                     If there's any problem, any problem
                     at all, come and talk to me and
                     I'll take care of it.
                         (beat)
                     Mrs. Collins...he has nowhere else
                     to go.

          It's an agonizing moment, then finally:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I...look, I'll take him home, but
                     only because I...might not be
                     thinking clearly right now, and --
          
                                  JONES
                     Thank you.
          
          Without giving her a moment to reconsider, he waves and the
          Chief of Police approaches as the press rushes toward them.
          
          In an instant, they're overwhelmed by people shouting
          questions, flashbulbs popping, a fever of excitement.

                     How does it feel to have your son
                     home, Mrs. Collins? What did you
                     think when you saw him for the first
                     time?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It was...it's...hard to explain.
          
                               JONES
                         (jumping in)
                     It was certainly quite a shock. At
                     first she hardly recognized him.
                     Perfectly natural, the boy's been
                     through quite an ordeal.

                     feels great to be home.
          
                               "WALTER"

                               JONES
                     Absolutely.
          
          He poses Christine and "Walter" so she is holding the boy in
          her arms. Dazed, stunned, confused, she manages to smile for
          the cameras. Bulbs FLASH and --
          
          -- time SLOWS DOWN, the SOUND MUTED, as Christine looks around
          at it all as though in a dream...reporters shouting questions
          she doesn't hear...bulbs flashing...the boy beside her, smiling
          at it all. He looks at her, mouths the word Mommy, as --
          
          INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          -- the car door SLAMS and she and the boy sit side by side.
          The silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment
          earlier. An officer gets in they drive off, passing Jones
          and the Chief of Police, talking quietly off to one side.
          
          Christine looks to the boy.   He smiles at her.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          The only noise is the clock on the wall, ticking. Christine
          sits at one end of the table, "Walter" at the other. Studying
          him. He is finishing a sandwich, not meeting her gaze.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Was the sandwich all right?
                         (he nods)
                     Would you like some more milk?
          
                               "WALTER"
                     No.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, thank you.
                               "WALTER"
                     No, thank you.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Now you need a bath. You're covered
                     with soot from the train ride.
          
          He turns, and heads up the stairs.   She follows.
          
          INT. HALLWAY FRONTING BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Carrying a pair of pajamas, Christine comes into the hall and
          stops in front of the bathroom door. Knocks.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I found you a pair of pajamas. I
                     bought them for Walter but he didn't
                     like the fabric, so --

                                "WALTER" (O.S.)
                     Ow!
          
          She hears him fall and pushes the door open.
          
          INT. BATHROOM
          
          She helps "Walter" stand, discreetly turned away from us.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Are you all right?
          
                                "WALTER"
                     I fell.   Stupid tub.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you hurt yourself?     Let me see --
          
          She stops suddenly, reacting to something we don't see.
          Looks slowly looks up to his face.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     ...circumcised....
          
          She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom.
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          She places him against the wall where she measured Walter's
          growth over the years. The marks put him four inches shorter
          than the one labeled March. She looks at him, very serious.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     The last time I measured Walter --
                     the last time I measured my son --
                     he was four inches taller than you
                     are right now.
                         (beat)
                     Who are you?
                         (beat)
                     What are you doing here?
                         (beat)
                     Who are you?
          
          He says nothing.   HOLD on her look of growing desperation.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Jones walks quickly down the hall, trying to look interested
          in a clutch of papers in his hands, Christine following after.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's not my son.

                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know who he is, or why he's
                     saying he's Walter, but there's
                     clearly been some kind of mistake.
          
                               JONES
                     We agreed you would give him time
                     to adjust --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's four inches shorter than Walter.
                     Boys his age don't shrink. If
                     anything, he should be taller.
          
                               JONES
                     Maybe your measurements are off.
                     Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
                     explanation for --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's circumcised. Walter wasn't.
          
          Jones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision
          with a woman in public view. He lowers his voice.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins...your son was missing
                     for four months. For at least part
                     of that in the company of an as-yet
                     unidentified drifter. Who knows
                     what such a disturbed individual
                     might have done? He could have had
                     him...circumcised... might have --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Made him smaller? Captain, please --
          
          He's on the move again, stepping into --
          INT. JONES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- and getting behind his desk as Christine follows him in.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     -- why won't you listen to me?
          
                               JONES
                     I am listening, damn it, I --
                         (beat, calmer)
                     I am listening. And I understand
                     your feelings. He's changed, no
                     mistake. You've both been through
                     a terrible experience. That's why
                     he needs your support and love to
                     bounce back.

                                 CHRISTINE
                       Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce
                       back as my son if you coated him in
                       rubber and dropped him off the roof.
          
          He sits, shaking his head.
          
                                 JONES
                       Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?
                       You seem perfectly capable of taking
                       care of the boy, your work pays you
                       enough to attend to his personal
                       needs...so I don't understand why
                       you're trying to run away from your
                       responsibilities --
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       I'm not running away from anything,
                       least of all my responsibilities.
                       I'm even taking care of that boy
                       because right now I'm all he has.
                       What worries me is that you've
                       stopped looking for Walter.
          
                                 JONES
                       Why should we look someone we've
                       already found?
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       But you haven't found him. He's
                       still out there somewhere, lost,
                       maybe hurt....
          
                                 JONES
                       His identity has been confirmed by
                       the best minds in the field of child

                       want to cause trouble for you or
                       the department. Honestly I don't.
                       I know you've done everything you
                       can...but there's been a terrible
                       mistake, and I need your help if
                       we're going to correct it...before
                       it's too late. Please.
          
          She exits.   Annoyed, Jones paces, then picks up the phone.
          
                                 JONES
                       Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.

          INT. COLLINS HOME - DAY
          
          Christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She
          opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR,
          sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr.
                     Captain Jones sent me. I consult
                     with him from time to time on
                     juvenile cases. May I come in?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Oh...yes, of course.
          
          She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Thank you for coming. I'm surprised
                     Captain Jones moved so quickly. I
                     was starting to think he didn't
                     believe me.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Well, I'm here now, and we'll put
                     all that to rights. Where is the
                     boy?
          
          He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs. Noting that he
          said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Ah! There he is. A handsome young
                     man. He has your eyes, doesn't he?
                     And a little bit of the nose. Very
                     fit, in spite of all his travails.
                     A very resilient boy you've got
                     here, Mrs. Collins.
          As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine
          stiffens...she can't have heard that right.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Doctor Tarr, I thought you were
                     here to help me.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     I am. Captain Jones said the boy
                     had gone through some extreme
                     physical changes, and asked me to
                     look in on him...to reassure you in
                     this your time of motherly concern.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     My "motherly concern" isn't for him
                     because he's not my son.

                                DR. TARR
                     Statements like that will hardly
                     help the boy's self-esteem, now
                     will they?
                         (beat)
                     Captain Jones said something about
                     a change in height...?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He's four inches shorter than --
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs.
                     Collins. We've known for some time
                     that trauma can affect the growth
                     of children. Given the stress of
                     the last four months his spine may
                     have actually shrunk. It's uncommon,
                     but within the realm of possibility.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What about the circumcision?
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Very likely his abductor thought it
                     appropriate. After all, circumcision
                     is hygienically sound. Must have
                     been quite traumatic at the time.
                     No wonder he's submerged the memory.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Look, doctor --
          
                               DR. TARR
                     As you can see, there's a perfectly
                     sound medical explanation for all
                     of this. But it's good for you to
                     raise these questions. You should
                     be apprised of all changes the lad
                     went through during his absence.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wouldn't I know whether or not he
                     was my son? I'm his mother.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Which means you're in no position
                     to be objective. You are looking
                     through the prism of extreme emotion
                     at a boy who has changed from what
                     you remember. He isn't the same
                     boy that left here, just as a boy
                     who goes off to war and returns
                     isn't the same anymore.

                     A mother's heart, driven by intuition
                     and emotion rather than logic, sees
                     these changes and rebels, insists
                     that this cannot be your son. But
                     that doesn't change the facts.
                         (beat)
                     I'm willing to put my theory to the
                     test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins...
                     are you?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What're you --
          
          Before she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads
          him outside. Christine follows them out to --
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- as Dr. Tarr strides onward, the police officer and "Walter"
          walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear. A few
          houses down they come to a group of CHILDREN playing.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Hello, children, my name is Dr.
                     Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you
                     some questions.
          
                               1ST KID
                     My mom says we're not supposed to
                     talk to strangers.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Good boy. Quite right. But as you
                     see I'm with the police, so it's
                     all right. Now, I'm sure you know
                     Mrs. Collins here, and her son,
                     Walter. How many of you recognize
                     this young boy as Walter Collins?
          
          He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply.
          Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Now, now, no need to be afraid.
                     Surely you knew Walter, and played
                     with him? So which of you can
                     identify Walter for me, for his
                     mother, and for the police? This
                     officer would want you to do the
                     right thing as good young citizens.
          
          The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize
          the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and
          the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands.
          Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is.

                               2ND KID
                     Walter was as tall as me....
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Yes, precisely. He was as tall as
                     you. Now he's not. He's lost a
                     little height, you see. It's a
                     thing called trauma. With luck,
                     none of you will ever have to find
                     out about it yourselves. So other
                     than that, do you recognize this as
                     your friend, Walter Collins?
          
                                  2ND KID
                     I guess...
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Dr. Tarr --
          
                               DR. TARR
                     Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins;
                     children can be intimidated. But
                     not adults. Shall we try a neighbor?
          
          He heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching
          down the street. Christine exchanges a look with the kids,
          then heads off to follow.
          
          EXT. RILEY'S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Tarr, Christine, Mrs. Riley, the officer and "Walter" stand
          on the porch.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     -- and we'd appreciate it if you
                     could make a positive identification
                     for us.
                               MRS. RILEY
                     I'd be happy to. I saw the boy
                     often. Come closer, son.
          
          She stoops down, studies "Walter's" face, turns it from side
          to side. Squints at him. He squints back at her. Note:
          she's not wearing glasses. Finally:
          
                               DR. TARR

                     Oh, yes...yes...that's Walter all
                     right. Used to come here all the
                     time to play with my nephew, Roger.

                               DR. TARR
                     Thank you, Mrs. Riley.   You've been
                     a big help, I --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you
                     have the time?
          
                               MRS. RILEY
                     Certainly....
          
          She looks at her watch. Holds it farther away. Can't quite
          focus on it. Pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse.
          
                               MRS. RILEY
                     My last concession to vanity; men
                     don't make passes at women who wear
                     glasses, you know.
                         (checks the watch)
                     Five o'clock.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Thank you.
          
          Mrs. Riley nods and heads inside as Christine looks to Tarr,
          who shrugs off what was just demonstrated.
          
                               DR. TARR

                     Come along, son.
          
          Tarr takes "Walter's" hand and heads away, Christine following,
          anger growing in her eyes as we HEAR:
          
                               CHRISTINE (V.O.)
                     This is absolutely outrageous!

          She is on the phone, "Walter" finishing up his dinner in BG.

                     That I was embarrassed isn't the

          She hangs up. Hard. The events of the day have her teetering
          on the edge, but she's holding on. She pulls herself together
          and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent
          BEAT before "Walter" looks up from his now-empty plate.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     I'm finished. Can I go to my room
                     now?
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Yes.   Go on up.
          
          "Walter" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not
          looking back at him. Exhausted mentally, physically and
          emotionally. He goes to the door, stops, turns.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     G'night, Mommy.
          
          Christine fumbles the plate and it SMASHES to the floor.   She
          turns furiously to "Walter."
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Stop saying that! I'm not your
                     mother! And you're not my son!
          She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING
                     THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY
                     SON BACK!
          
          He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes.
          
                               CHRISTINE

                     I want my son back...god, please...

          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          "Walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears
          in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed.

          He doesn't move.   Her voice is soft, but firm.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I was wrong to yell at you. You're
                     still a child, and I think you don't
                     really understand what you're doing,
                     the hurt you're causing. Maybe
                     this is all just some big game of
                     pretend to you, but I need you to
                     understand. Walter is...he's all I
                     have, he's everything to me, and
                     every day we lose because of this
                     puts him further away from where I
                     can help him.
                         (beat)
                     Whatever the police think, whatever
                     the world thinks, we know the truth,
                     don't we? We both know you're not
                     Walter. Getting you to admit that
                     may be the only chance I have to
                     straighten this out before it's too
                     late. Maybe you're afraid of getting
                     in trouble, that you're in too deep.
                     But you're not. You don't have to
                     tell me who you are, you just have
                     to tell them who you're not. Just...
                     tell them the truth.
          
          He doesn't respond. She gives it a moment in case he might
          open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. She
          switches off the light and heads off down the hallway.
          
                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

          Pastor Briegleb is typing out his sermon for the day. He's
          exhausted. Looks at the clock. 6:30 a.m. He rubs tiredly
          at his face when he HEARS the THUMP of the newspaper being
          delivered. He stands, stretches and steps out to --
          
          EXT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- where the newspaper is visible on the front lawn. He picks
          it up and starts into the rectory as he unfolds the paper.
          
          Then: he slows, stunned by something he's reading.   He looks
          up again, and hurries back into the rectory.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
          
          She's in bed, asleep, as the telephone RINGS downstairs. She
          glances at the clock: 6:45. She clearly doesn't want to go
          down to answer it...then reluctantly climbs out of bed.

          She starts to reply, but the line goes dead. She hangs up
          the phone, pulls her robe closer around her, and steps out to
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN
          where a copy of the Los Angeles Times sits on a neighbor's
          front lawn. She looks around, then dashes to pick it up.
          She unfolds it as she heads back, then abruptly stops. She
          can't believe what she's seeing.
          
          CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER. The headline reads Mysterious

                     to his mother. Not only does it
                     state clearly that you are the boy's
                     mother, one could infer from this
                     that you are somehow responsible
                     for these changes...and that the
                     police are concerned for the boy's
                     welfare in your hands.

          reporters, enjoying the attention.
          
                               DR. TARR
                     -- and it's clear that he has
                     something to tell. I'm sure that
                     in time he will give his boyish
                     story of the entire affair, but not
                     until he has faith in his listener.
                     And that is what is lacking: faith
                     in the poor lad's story. In the
                     course of my examination, I found

                     been coached or questioned to a
                     point where he is largely confused
                     about what happened to him during

                       those many months. It's possible
                       that his mental lapse may be the
                       result of a blow to the head or a
                       sudden shock which brought about a
                       possible cranial injury. I believe
                       that this condition will pass soon.
                       Until then, I recommend that the
                       police department continue working
                       with him, exposing him to whatever
                       elements of his previous life as
                       may help restore his memory.

                     Mrs. Collins, I have made it my
                     mission to bring to light all the
                     things the LAPD would prefer no one
                     knew anything about...a department
                     ruled by violence, abuse, murder,
                     corruption and intimidation.

          FAUX NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of Police Chief Davis speaking before a
          bunch of microphones.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB (O.S.)
                     When Chief Davis took over the LAPD
                     two years ago, he said --
          
                               DAVIS
                         (overlapping)
                     We will hold court on gunmen in the
                     Los Angeles streets. I want them
                     brought in dead, not alive, and I
                     will reprimand any officer who shows
                     the least mercy to a criminal.
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          A crowd of police officers, armed with machine-guns, BLAST
          the hell out of a group of guys lined up against a wall.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.)
                     He picked fifty of the most dangerous
                     cops on the force, gave them machine
                     guns and permission to shoot anyone
                     who got in their way. He called
                     them the Gun Squad. No lawyers.
                     No trials. No questions, suspensions
                     or investigations. Just piles of
                     bodies.

          Another guy, beaten to a bloody pulp, is SHOVED out of a moving
          car and left in the rain.

                     Bodies in morgues, bodies in
                     hospitals, bodies by the side of
                     the road, barely alive. Not because
                     the police wanted to wipe out crime,
                     they just wanted to get rid of the
                     competition.
          
          EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT
          
          A pair of cops and a couple of thugs inspect a truck carrying
          booze over the border from Canada, pay the freight and watch
          as the trucks drive off in the truck.

                     Mayor Cryer and half the police

                     When the gloves came off, pretty
                     soon the rest of the department got
                     into the brutality act. Didn't
                     want the Gun Squad to have all the
                     fun, after all.

          Two officers are sexually assaulting a woman on the stairs.

                     The more they got away with it, the
                     worse things got, because when you
                     give folks the freedom to do whatever
                     they want, as God saw in the Garden

                     A lot of mothers' sons ended up
                     being sacrificed to expediency around
                     here, Mrs. Collins. Yours wouldn't
                     be the first. Do this right, and

          She gets up from the table, paces the garden.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     If they honestly thought I was wrong,
                     that'd be one thing...but if they
                     don't care, if they're just trying

                     This is their attempt to win by
                     framing the discussion their way.
                     "Why, of course it's her son...yes,
                     there have been changes...we're
                     looking into it, and isn't it strange
                     that they happened after the boy
                     got home?"
                         (beat)
                     They're putting you in the position
                     of having to disprove what they're
                     saying...and that's hard. Most

                       Your son's upper front teeth were
                       separated by a small muscle. Made
                       them sit about an eighth of an inch
                       apart. The boy in that room has no
                       such gap.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       Does a gap like that get smaller
                       with age? Because that's what
                       they'll say.
          
                                 DR. MONTGOMERY
                       In some cases, yes, it's possible.
                       But the muscle between Walter's
                       teeth prevents that from happening.
                       They can never come together without
                       an operation to sever the muscle,
                       and I can tell you right now that
                       he has never had such an operation.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       Will you be willing to sign a letter
                       saying that officially?
          
                                 DR. MONTGOMERY
                       Pardon my language, but...hell,
                       yes.
          
          He hears an OS moan from the inner office.
          
                                  DR. MONTGOMERY
                       Sounds like the anesthetic is wearing
                       off.
                            (starts in, pauses)
                       On the other hand, maybe I'll write
                       that letter first. Give the little
                       fella something to think about.

                                MRS. FOX
                      I didn't say take a seat. I said
                      take your seat. Your assigned seat.
                      You must know which one it is, you

          "Walter" tries another vacant seat. There are only three
          vacant seats in the room. More laughter from the kids.
          
                                MRS. FOX
                      Try again. Here's a hint: There's
                      only one more empty seat left.
          
          He sits.   Mrs. Fox looks to Christine.

                      I'll eat my yardstick. Not only
                      will I put that in writing, I'll
                      swear to it in a court of law and
                      in front of President Calvin Coolidge
                      himself if I have to.
          
          For the first time, Christine allows a hopeful smile.
          
          INT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The lights are low. Christine sits on the floor, sorting
          through a box containing artifacts of affection: class projects
          made by Walter, trees and houses and clay dogs; a heart-shaped
          card Mother's Day card, hand-made, with I Love You, Mommy
          carefully printed on the front. She runs her finger over it,
          tracing the impression left by his pencil.
          
          She starts to cry, and a tear falls onto the pencil drawing.
          She frantically dabs at it, trying to preserve it from
          distortion...then sets it down and covers her face, weeping.

          EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING (RAIN)
          
          A cold, wet knot of reporters and photographers are waiting
          in the rain on the steps to City Hall. Christine sits in a
          car with Briegleb, looking at it all.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: SEPTEMBER 6, 1928
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I'll see you tonight at eight for
                     my broadcast. I'll leave the back
                     door open and a light on. Good
                     luck.
          
          She nods, exits the car and walks up the steps to the front
          of City Hall as he drives off. She stands before the press,
          looks at them for a moment, then begins.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Good morning. My name is Christine
                     Collins. On March 10th, my nine
                     year old son, Walter Collins,
                     disappeared. A four month
                     investigation resulted in a boy
                     being brought to Los Angeles from
                     De Kalb, Illinois. They told me,
                     and all of you, that this boy was
                     my son. They were wrong.
                         (beat)
                     The Los Angeles Police Department
                     made a mistake...a terrible mistake.
                     The boy they found is not my son.
                     That is the reason for the supposed
                     "transformation." I have letters
                     from his dentist, his teachers and
                     others confirming that this boy is
                     not my son. The letters are being
                     reprinted now, and I should have
                     them for you tomorrow.
          
          Flashbulbs pop, dazzling her.    She composes herself.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I have given the police department
                     every opportunity to admit their
                     mistake and renew the search for my
                     son. Since they have refused to do
                     so, I have no choice but to present
                     my case before the public. I hope
                     this will persuade the police to
                     finish the job they started, and
                     bring my son home to me.
                         (beat)
                     Thank you.

          As the reporters start to shout out questions, we PAN ACROSS
          to a BEAT COP who has been watching. He goes quickly to a
          police call-box, unlocks it and picks up the telephone.
          
          INT. LINCOLN HEIGHTS STATION - DAY
          
          The glass door to Captain Jones' office is closed, but we can
          SEE him on the phone. Finally, he hangs up and comes out of
          the office. His tone is cold but neutral...we think this
          could go either way. He stops an officer.
          
                               JONES
                     Morelli, I want you to find the
                     Collins woman and get her here.
                     Bring her in the back way, and have
                     a couple of matrons standing by.
          
                                 1ST COP
                     Yes, sir.
          
          He heads off as Jones goes into his office, closing the door.
          
          EXT. LINCOLN HEIGHT STATION - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY (RAIN)
          
          A police car pulls up to the curb, and Christine and "Walter"
          emerge from the back seat. They dash through the rain to the
          back door, followed by the 1st Cop.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Why are we using the back door?
          
                               1ST COP
                     Captain's orders.     Front's jammed
                     with reporters.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Is it?
          She allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as she's led into
          
          INT. STATION - BULLPEN
          
          where she's directed to a wooden bench. A nearby clock reads
          3:45. She sits, "Walter" silent beside her. In the BG, the
          Desk Sergeant puts a call on hold.

                     He's living with his cousin on some
                     ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.
          
                               YBARRA
                     All right, I'll take it, got nothing
                     better to do....
          
          Ybarra takes the call as Jones' calls from his office.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins.
          
          Christine starts to take "Walter's" hand when a matron appears.
          
                                JONES
                     Leave the boy for now.   We'll look
                     after him.
          
          She hands "Walter" over to the matron, then enters
          
          INT. JONES' OFFICE
          
          He leaves the door open and indicates for Christine to sit.
          She does. He paces, working up to what he's going to do.
          
                               JONES
                     You've put us through quite a bit
                     of trouble, Mrs. Collins. This
                     situation has become an embarrassment
                     for the entire department.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     It wasn't my intention to embarrass
                     anyone.
                               JONES
                     No, of course not. You just told
                     the papers we can't tell one boy
                     from another as a compliment for
                     the months we spent working on your
                     case. Are you trying to make fools
                     out of us? Is that it? Do you
                     enjoy this?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, of course not. I had to get
                     your attention, I had to make you
                     understand...he's not my son.
          
          He circles, closing in on her. She becomes aware that the
          door is open, and he's doing this for the benefit of anyone
          who might be listening in.

                               JONES
                     You know what your problem is? You
                     want to shirk your responsibilities
                     as a mother. You enjoyed being a
                     free woman, didn't you? Enjoyed
                     not having to worry about a young
                     son. You could do what you wanted,
                     go where you wanted, see anyone you
                     wanted. But then we found your
                     son. Brought him back. And now
                     he's an inconvenience. That's why
                     you cooked up this whole scheme, to
                     try and throw him to the state, let
                     the state raise him for you.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's not true!
          
                               JONES
                     No? Even the boy says he's your
                     son. Why would he do that? How
                     would he know to do that?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know! All I know is that
                     he's lying!
          
                               JONES
                     Maybe so. Maybe he is a liar. But
                     that's how he's been trained, isn't
                     it? Lying was born in both of you.
                     You're a liar and a troublemaker
                     and if you ask me you've got no
                     business walking the streets of Los
                     Angeles.

                     Just a minute --
                               JONES
                     Because either you know you're lying,
                     or you're not capable of knowing if
                     you're lying or telling the truth.
                     So which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are
                     you a derelict mother? Or just
                     nuts? Because from where I sit,
                     those are the only options.

          The door opens, and a POLICE MATRON enters. He looks back to
          Christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool
          determination. This scene is about to take an abrupt change.
          
                               JONES
                     Mrs. Collins...do you still insist
                     that the boy out there is not your
                     son?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes.
          
          He nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wait...what are you doing?
          
          The Matron cuffs Christine's hands behind her back.
          
                               MATRON
                     Please don't struggle, ma'am.   You'll
                     only hurt yourself.
          
          A CLICK, and the handcuffs are in place.

                     Since his return, she has complained
                     that he is still missing, and has
                     made repeated requests that he be
                     found, saying, "This is not my
                     Walter," even though positive
                     identification has been established.
          
          EXT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          The police van enters the hospital at 1200 North State Street.
          
          INT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - DAY
          
          A sterile, dreary, white-on-white place where in the
          background, we can HEAR the sounds of the insane crying out.
          The matron leads a stunned Christine to the front desk.
          
                               JONES (V.O.)
                     She suffers from paranoia, delusions
                     of persecution, and dislocation
                     from reality. She may be a threat
                     to herself or others. We recommend
                     that she be conveyed to the
                     psychopathic ward for treatment and
                     observation until her senses can be
                     restored.
          The matron stops before the desk.   The NURSE barely looks up.
          
                               MATRON

                     Wait...please, this is a mistake.

                               MATRON
                     Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights
                     division.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                         (forced calm)
                     Please...you have to listen to me.
                     The police are doing this to punish
                     me. They tried to force this boy
                     on me and tell me he was my son,
                     but it wasn't my son, and now they
                     say I'm crazy --
          
          She stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and
          the matron. Her story sounds insane, even to her. She begins
          to realize the depth of her predicament.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Oh, god...oh god, please, no....
          
                               NURSE
                     If you continue to struggle I'll
                     have to put you in a straitjacket.
                     Do you want that?
                         (she shakes head)
                     Good. Then behave yourself.
                         (to orderlies)
                     Code twelve.
          
          The matron turns Christine over to two large male ORDERLIES,
          who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, please, you have to listen to
                     me...wait...please!
          
          They force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane
          growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare.
          INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM
          
          Christine is ushered into the room by a NURSE.
          
                               NURSE
                     Take off your clothes.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Why?
          
                               NURSE
                     Physical examination, body cavity

                     for all new patients.
          
          The nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves.

                               CHRISTINE
                     That's not necessary --
          
                               NURSE
                     You can remove your clothes yourself,
                     or I can have the orderlies do it
                     for you. Which do you prefer?
          
          Reluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes.
          
          INT. SHOWER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          ON CHRISTINE'S FACE as she stands in a spray of water and
          disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some
          from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in BG. Christine's
          eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation.
          
                               NURSE
                     Spread your legs.
                         (a beat)
                     Wider.
          
          Biting her lip, Christine complies.
          
          INT. HALL - LATER
          
          Wet hair plastered to her face, dressed in a hospital gown,
          Christine is led down a long hall by the Nurse. As she passes
          the closed doors, we HEAR women weeping, talking to themselves,
          crying out, screaming, beating on the walls. Fingers poke
          through narrow viewing slits in the doors.
          
          The Nurse pulls out a key-ring and unlocks one of the doors.
          
                                NURSE
                     Inside.
          
          Christine enters --
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Bare, forbidding, four white walls and a narrow slit of a
          window. It's a two-person room. Sitting on the other bed is
          another PATIENT.
          
                               NURSE
                     This is your room. The doctor's
                     left for the day. He'll see you in
                     the morning.

                     to talk to someone in authority --

                               CHRISTINE
                     Then if I could just use the phone.
          
                               NURSE
                     Phone privileges are earned by good
                     behavior. You're not allowed
                     newspapers, magazines, radio, books

                     own good.
          
          The Nurse exits, closing and locking the door.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wait...please! There's been a
                     terrible mistake!
          
          Nothing. She's alone with the other Patient, who doesn't
          much like the noise and disturbance.
          
                               PATIENT
                     My room. My room.       They SAID it
                     was MY ROOM!
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I'm sorry, I --
          
                                  PATIENT

                     ROOM!
          
          She starts SCREAMING.    Christine covers her ears.
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
          We slowly PULL AWAY from the narrow window, and the sound of
          screaming, into the late afternoon rain and growing darkness.
          
                                                        CUT TO:
          
          EXT. OLD ROAD - EARLY EVENING
          
          A lone truck sits beside the road, hood open, steam coming
          from the radiator.
          
          GORDON NORTHCOTT, thirties, thin and angular, finishes working
          on the car as a police car approaches. The detective we saw
          earlier, Ybarra, is inside. He rolls down the window.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     Problem?

                               GORDON
                     Overheated, that's all.   She'll be
                     fine in a bit.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Listen, could you give me a hand?
                     I'm trying to find a place called
                     the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.
          
          As he answers, Gordon moves casually to the back of the open
          truck to get a rag to wipe his hands. There is a GUN on the
          floor of the trunk. Gordon picks it up inside the rag.
          
                               GORDON
                     Northcott Ranch...oh yeah. You're
                     almost there. Follow this west for
                     about two, three miles. Then the
                     next right. That'll bring you right
                     to it. Something going on?
          
                               YBARRA
                     Just looking into a juvenile matter.
                     Thanks for the help.
          
          Ybarra drives away. As soon as he's out of sight, Gordon
          slams the hood, runs to the driver's side and starts the truck,
          still steaming. He drives off as fast as he can.
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING
          
          A long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a
          large open area cluttered with junked cars. At the far end
          of the open area is a chicken coop, about fifteen feet long.
          Ybarra drives up in front of the house, gets out, looks around.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Hello?
          ANOTHER ANGLE - POV SHOT
          
          Someone is watching as Ybarra moves toward the main house.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Anybody home?
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ybarra glances off to a rustling SOUND, and follows it to
          
          EXT. CHICKEN COOP
          
          A few chickens inside, held back by wire. An ax is nearby,
          its stained edge buried in an old wooden stump. A corner of
          the coop seems to have come down and been crudely repaired.

          BACK TO SCENE
          
          As suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house,
          SLAMMING the door. Ybarra runs to the porch, tries the door.
          Locked from the inside. He pounds on the door.
          
                                YBARRA
                      This is the police. I have a warrant
                      for a minor named Sanford Clark.
                      Open the door and stand aside.
          
          No reply.   He braces himself and KICKS open the door.
          
          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN
          
          The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place.
          The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a
          mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound
          except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock.
          There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances
          into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world.
          Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of
          wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches
          for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the
          closet explodes outward and --
          
          -- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking
          him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on
          the floor as Sanford tries to escape.
                                YBARRA
                      Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your
                      face through the floor!
          
          Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling.   Ybarra
          cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back.
          
                                YBARRA
                      On your feet.
          
          Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle
          and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize
          as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott.
          
          INT. YBARRA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's
          side. He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror.

                                YBARRA

                     You can't just stay in the U.S. as
                     long as you want, pal. We've got a
                     orders to send you back home, and --
          
          Suddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical
          laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the
          reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Didn't know Canada was that funny.
          
          Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off.

          Gustav Briegleb sits behind the microphone, waiting to go on
          the air. He looks at the clock. 7:59. Glances to an AIDE.
                               BRIEGLEB
                     No word from Mrs. Collins?
                         (aide shakes head)
                     Get on down to her house, make sure
                     she's all right. If she's not there,
                     call the LAPD, see what they know.
          
          The aide hurries off as Briegleb turns back to the microphone
          and touches a switch. The ON THE AIR lamp glows to life.

          Christine is in bed, wide awake, the sounds of the asylum
          somewhat lessened now. Her face is dimly lit by moonlight.
          
                               BRIEGLEB (V.O.)
                     I had hoped to have a guest with us
                     tonight, but apparently she has
                     been delayed. Since she can't be
                     here to tell you what she told the
                     press this afternoon, I'll fill in
                     the best I can. I'm going to tell
                     you what happened, and I'm going to
                     keep telling you right here, every
                     night...until someone does something
                     about it.
          
          On her face, we go to
          
          INT. UNION STATION - TICKET BOOTH - NIGHT
          
          Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth.
          
                               GORDON
                     I'd like a ticket to Canada. Alberta
                     or Vancouver, whatever's leaving
                     tonight.
          
                               TICKET VENDER
                     Don't have anything going that far
                     tonight. Best I can do is put you
                     on a train for Seattle. From there
                     you can transfer to one of the locals
                     or drive across the border.
          
                               GORDON
                     That'll be fine.
                               TICKET VENDER
                     Round-trip?
          
                                  GORDON
                     One way.
          
          The vender moves away to pull the ticket. Gordon glances at
          a cop heading his way. Stiffens. The cop continues past
          him. Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across.
          
                               TICKET VENDER
                     That'll be fifteen dollars.
          
          Gordon pays for the ticket and heads toward the boarding gates.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
          
          Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept
          all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe
          woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock
          behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL
          goes off, announcing the start of the day.
          
          We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine
          stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in
          the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown...
          looking like someone who actually belongs in this place.
          
          The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Can I see the doctor?   Or someone
                     in charge --
          
                               NURSE
                     Breakfast is half an hour.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     But I --
          
                                NURSE
                     Down the hall. The doctor will
                     call for you when he's ready.
                         (beat)
                     Go or stay, either way I lock the
                     door.
          
          Christine doesn't want to stay, so she moves off.
          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DINING AREA - MORNING
          
          Christine and the other patients sit at long tables. A few
          talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly
          ahead. Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro-
          convulsive (shock) therapy. It's a scary bunch. Christine
          isn't eating.
          
          Another female patient, CAROL DEXTER, thirties, watches
          Christine then slides closer. A BEAT, then:
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     You should eat. Eating is normal.
                     You got to do everything you can to
                     look normal. That's the only chance
                     you've got. Besides, you'll need
                     the strength.

          Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice
          from someone she assumed was probably nuts. Reluctantly, she
          begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     My name's Carol Dexter.    What's
                     yours?
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Christine.     Christine Collins.
          
          Christine reacts to the taste of the food, which is awful.
          
                               CAROL   DEXTER
                     Finish it all.    I know it's hard,
                     but you have to   try. Lunch isn't
                     as bad. Close,    but not as --
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I won't be here that long. As soon
                     as I can talk to a doctor, they'll
                     realize there's been a terrible
                     mistake and --
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Yeah, that always works.
                         (beat, quieter)
                     I heard them talking. You're here
                     on a code twelve, police action.
                     The doctors, the staff, they figure
                     that if the police sent you here,
                     there must be a good reason for it.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Then I'll just have to prove that
                     I'm not insane.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Yeah? How? The more you try to
                     act sane, the crazier you start to
                     look. If you smile too much, you're
                     delusional or stifling hysteria.
                     If you don't smile, you're depressed.
                     If you're neutral you're emotionally
                     withdrawn and potentially catatonic.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     You seem to have given this a great
                     deal of thought.
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                     I have. Don't you get it? You're
                     code twelve. So am I. We're here
                     for the same reason.
                         (beat)
                     We pissed off the cops.

          Christine sits back heavily, starting to understand the world
          more than she ever wanted to.
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                     What, you thought you were the only
                     one?
                          (points os)
                     The lady over there was married to
                     a cop who kept beating her up.
                     When she tried to tell somebody,
                     they sent her here. And that one?
                     The police beat the crap out of her
                     brother, broke both his arms. When
                     she complained to the papers, they
                     picked her up and...
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     What about you?
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     I...work nights.
                         (Chris doesn't get it)
                     I mean, I work nights. Downtown.
                     In some of the clubs. You know.
          
          It gets through.   Hooker.   Christine nods.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     This one client started hitting me,
                     and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a
                     complaint. Turns out he was a cop.
                     Next thing I know, I'm here.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     But how can they --
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                     You're kidding right? Hey, everybody
                     knows women are fragile, right?
                     They're all emotions, no logic,
                     nothin' goin' on upstairs. And
                     sometimes, like when they say
                     something that's a little, y'know,
                     inconvenient...they just go fucking
                     nuts, pardon my French. If we're
                     insane, nobody has to listen to us.
                     I mean, who are you going to believe,
                     some crazy woman trying to destroy
                     the integrity of the force, or a
                     police officer? Then once they get
                     us in here, we either learn to
                     behave, and shut up, or --
                         (beat)
                     Or you don't go home...or you go
                     home like that.

          She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by
          surgical scars. Lobotomized. Christine turns away.
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                      Better finish up your oatmeal.
                      Want to look sane for the doctors.
                      Then I want to hear what they nailed
                      you for.
          
          Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal.
          
          INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Sanford Clark sits near several other juveniles being held.
          Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler
          against his knees.
          
          FEATURE the ruler.   Rising.   Falling.   Tapping.   Then back --
          
          -- on Sanford as we hear it continuing to tap OS.     PUSH IN ON
          his face. Then, suddenly --
          
          FLASHBACK
          
          -- on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler
          tapping. There's blood on the hatchet.
          
          Gordon Northcott's eyes glitter insanely as he brings the
          hatchet down again and just as it comes right AT US we flash --
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          As Sanford CRIES OUT with the memory. We PULL BACK to see
          the others in the room staring at him. He turns away, won't
          meet their gaze. Something's terribly wrong.
          
          Just then, an ADMINISTRATOR comes in.
                                ADMINISTRATOR
                      Clark...Sanford Clark.
          
          Sanford rises, goes to the Administrator.
          
                                ADMINISTRATOR
                      Paperwork's come through. You'll
                      be deported back to Canada day after
                      tomorrow. The police there will to
                      decide what to do with you next. I
                      hope your stay here has convinced
                      you not to try crossing the border

          He starts to turn and walk away when:

                               ADMINISTRATOR
                     I'm sure he has far more important
                     things to do than --
          
                                SANFORD
                     Please.   It's important.
          
          The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled.
          
                               ADMINISTRATOR
                     He's off-duty until tomorrow, but...
                     I'll see what I can do. No promises.
          
          And with that, the administrator heads away.
          
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON
          
          Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A
          truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon
          runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out.
          
                               DRIVER
                     How far you going?
          
                                  GORDON

                                  DRIVER
                     Hop in.
          
          Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under
          the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts
          out a short length of metal pipe.
                               DRIVER
                     Don't worry about that, pal. Just
                     a little insurance. A couple of
                     guys tried to hijack my truck a few
                     years ago so they could run booze
                     over the border. You can't be too
                     safe, you know?
          
                               GORDON
                     Yeah, I surely do.
          
          Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly
          SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over.
          Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the
          Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off.

          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the
          hall by one of the nurses. She's led into --
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters.
          He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious.
          
                               STEELE
                     Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele.
                     Please, have a seat.
          
          The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs
          in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair.
          Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane.
          
                               STEELE
                     I hope your stay has been comfortable
                     so far.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Fine.   Thank you.
          
                               STEELE
                     Really? I'd think it would be quite
                     difficult at first.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                         (catching herself)
                     Well, it was. Difficult, I mean.
                     But comfortable.
          
          He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going
          well. He motions to the bandage on her arm.
          
                               STEELE
                     I see they took a blood test.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Wasserman Test. To check for
                     syphilis. Apparently it can affect
                     the mind.
          
                               STEELE
                     The idea that someone thinks you
                     should be checked for syphilis...did
                     that upset you?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No. Not at all. I'm sure it's...
                     standard procedure.
          
          She smiles a forced smile.   Trying to appear level-headed.

                     But...at the same time...I imagine
                     that it would be...would probably
                     be upsetting to...some people that
                     someone else might...suspect that

                     However inappropriate that might
                     be.
          
          She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks
          up the report on his desk, glances it over.
          
                               STEELE
                     According to your file, you believe
                     the police have substituted a fake
                     boy for your son. Is that true?
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I didn't say they substituted a fake
                     boy, just...not the right boy.
                         (beat)
                     They brought back the wrong boy.
                     Not my son. He's still missing.
          
          He starts pulling out papers from his file.
          
                               STEELE
                     That's strange...you see, I have
                     here a newspaper article with a
                     photo of you at the train station,
                     welcoming your son home. That is
                     you in the photo, isn't it?
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes.
          
                                STEELE
                     So at first he was your son, but
                     now he's not your son.

                     persecute you?
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     No.    Of course not.
          
                               STEELE
                     The police are here to protect us.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's right.
          
          He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to
          hear. It's a chess match that ends with:
          
                                STEELE
                     That's odd, because according to
                     the head nurse, when you were
                     admitted you accused the police of
                     conspiring to do this deliberately,
                     to punish you. So either she and
                     the interns are also conspiring
                     against you...or you're changing
                     your story.
                         (beat)
                     Do you often have trouble telling
                     reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?
          
          He sits back.    Christine's face tells the story.

          He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette.
          Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out.
          
                                YBARRA

          A long BEAT.   Sanford composes himself, begins:
          
                               SANFORD
                     My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He
                     owns the ranch where you found me.
                     He let me live there in exchange
                     for watching the place when he was
                     gone, doing chores, stuff like that.
                     Said I could stay on as long as I
                     wanted to. I figured that also
                     meant I could leave whenever I wanted
                     to, but he wouldn't let me.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Are you saying he held you prisoner?
                         (sanford nods)
                     Bull. When I got to the ranch you
                     were running around free as a
                     jaybird. Could've left any time
                     you wanted. So what's this, some
                     kind of story to cover why you were
                     in the country illegally?
          
                               SANFORD
                     No...no, it's nothing like that.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Because I don't have time for --
          
                               SANFORD
                     Listen to me, please.    He said --

                     What?   What did he --
          
                               SANFORD
                     He said that if I tried to leave,
                     he'd kill me!

                               SANFORD (Cont'd)
                     You don't understand, you don't
                     know what he's like, what he...what
                     we did...what he made me do.
          
          Sanford is in tears by now. Ybarra realizes that there's
          something real going on here, and backs off.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Okay, lets start at the beginning.
                     What did he make you do?
          
          Sanford closes his eyes.    Takes a long beat.   Finally....
          
                               SANFORD
                     Him and me...me and Gordon, we...
                         (beat, softly)
                     ...we killed some kids.
          
          Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand.
          
                               SANFORD
                     I didn't mean to, I swear...he made
                     me help him, said if I didn't he'd
                     kill me, too. Please, you gotta
                     help me...I'm scared...I don't want
                     to go to Hell for killing kids.

                               SANFORD
                     I don't know...I never knew their
                     names.

                     All together?
          
          He thinks about it for a moment. The fact that he has to add
          them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next.
          
                               SANFORD
                     About...twenty, I guess.

                               SANFORD
                     Yeah...thereabouts...I kinda stopped
                     counting after a while, and Gordon
                     said one or two might've gotten
                     away, but --
          
                               YBARRA
                     Nobody can just up and kill twenty

                     How?
          
          Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly....
          
                               SANFORD
                     Most times we'd bring back just one
                     or two...sometimes as many as three.
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - DAY
          
          Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking
          the engine as Sanford looks on nervously.
          
                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     I always knew when he was getting
                     ready 'cause he'd go through the
                     car and clean it up, make sure the
                     tires were good, the engine...he
                     was always afraid something'd break
                     down and we'd be caught.
          
          Gordon slams the hood shut, looks to Sanford.    Smiles.
          
                               GORDON
                     Time to go.
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          A kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself,
          as the truck starts to approach from behind.
          
                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     We'd go a different direction every
                     time, never hit the same part of
                     town twice. Sometimes we'd go for
                     hours, just driving around, until
                     we found somebody.
          
          The truck comes beside the kid and Gordon leans out the window.

                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     He'd use all kinds of different
                     stories. Sometimes he'd say he had
                     free tickets for the circus, or he
                     was looking for a lost dog...that
                     one worked real good. Other days --

                     There you are, we've been looking
                     for you like mad.

                               GORDON
                     Sure thing. Your folks, they got
                     in an accident. They sent us to
                     find you. They're hurt real bad.
                     The police took 'em to the hospital,
                     but they didn't have time to come
                     find you, so we said we'd do it.
                     Now come on, hurry...we gotta get
                     to the hospital, see your folks.

                     A lot of kids won't get in a car
                     alone with a stranger, but when
                     he's got a kid there with him, that
                     made it easier.
                         (beat)
                     They'd look to me, and figure if I
                     was safe, they would be too. That's
                     why he needed me, see?
                                  SANFORD
                     It's okay.     Come on in.

                     Every time they got in the truck,
                     it was like I wanted to die.

                               SANFORD (V.O.)
                     Then, as soon as we got back to the
                     ranch...they went in the coop.
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT
          
          The boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop.   There are
          two other boys there, also crying and screaming.
          
                                SANFORD (V.O.)
                     Some days he'd do 'em right off.
                     Other days, he'd wait, pick up a
                     few more, keep 'em in the coop until
                     he had like four or five, 'cause --
                         (beat)
                     -- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream
                     all at once. Like they were some
                     kinda chorus. And then....
          
          QUICK IMAGES
          
          Gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop.

                     ...and then....
          
          The kids, screaming.
          
          Sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light
          in the coop swinging wildly.
          
          Gordon grabbing an ax.    Raising it.
          
          On Sanford's eyes, terrified.
          
          The ax begins to fall in SLOW MOTION and --
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          -- as the long ash at the end of Ybarra's cigarette, TUMBLES
          to the floor in SLOW MOTION, end over end, SHATTERING when it
          hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed.
          
                                SANFORD
                     Sometimes...sometimes he'd leave
                     one or two of 'em alive...barely
                     anyway...and tell me...finish 'em.
                     Finish 'em...or I'll finish you.

                     And I did...I did...oh god...oh,

                     'em...I killed 'em....
          
          Then: silence, except for Sanford's sobbing. Ybarra realizes
          he hasn't been breathing. He tries to find his voice.

                         (sanford nods)
                     Just a second.
          
          He goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing
          kids bound with a rubber band. Hands it to Sanford.
          
                                YBARRA
                     I haven't updated these in a while,
                     but still, it should be....
                         (beat)
                     Just go through...and if you see
                     any faces you recognize, put it on
                     the table.
          
          Sanford takes the photos.   Starts going through them.
          
          A photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A
          third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder,
          BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row.
          He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos.
          
          Then he SLAMS down the last one and   half-falls, half-stumbles
          out of his chair, sobbing...goes to   the corner of the room
          and slides down the wall until he's   sitting in a fetal
          position, hands covering his face.    Sobbing uncontrollably.
          
          Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at
          it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then
          a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over,
          he stops, staring at it.
          
                               YBARRA

                     I'm sorry, captain, but he's here

                     He's asking about Christine Collins.

                     I tried. He said he's not leaving...

          There's a disturbance off-screen and she goes to deal with it

          He's drawn to the window by the sound of voices. He peeks
          through the slats. Several dozen placard-carrying parishioners
          and members of the Women's Temperance League are standing in
          the street, beating drums and calling Christine's name.

                     Departmental policy is what I say
                     it is, you got that? Now I'm
                     ordering you to get your ass back
                     here with that kid, you got that?
                     You bring him here and you talk to
                     no one, got it? Nobody!
          
          He slams the phone down.   CUT BACK TO --
          
          -- Ybarra in juvenile hall, agonizing over this. Finally,
          his voice resigned, he looks into the interrogation room.
          
                               YBARRA
                     All right, let's go.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Jones has come out into the hall, where Briegleb, several
          supporters and a handful of reporters are standing at the
          receiving officer's desk. They approach quickly.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Are you Captain Jones?
          
                                JONES
                     I am.
                               BRIEGLEB
                     What the hell have you done with
                     Christine Collins? Don't try and
                     lie your way out of it. I talked
                     to several neighbors who saw her
                     being driven off in a police car.
          
                                JONES
                     Mrs. Collins has been placed in
                     protective custody following a mental
                     breakdown.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     A what?!
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                      75.
          
          
                               JONES
                     Her statements and behavior have
                     been found to be consistent with a
                     delusional state of mind that could
                     make her a danger to herself or
                     others. In the public interest, we
                     are looking after her son while she
                     gets the help she clearly needs.
          
                                 BRIEGLEB
                     Where?
          
                               JONES
                     Sorry, we're withholding that
                     information to respect the privacy
                     of the family. But I can assure
                     you that she's getting the best
                     treatment available. That's all.
          
          He heads back the way he came as the others shout questions
          after him, held back by other police officers.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DAY ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Patients are being corralled into a line that extends to a
          barred window where a nurse is dispensing pills.
          
                               VOICE ON PA

                     for medication....
          
          Christine is nudged forward by an orderly, Carol beside her.
          
                                ORDERLY
                     Go on.   Move up.

                                ORDERLY

                     you relax.
          
          She's nudged to the window, where a nurse hands out a pill
          and water.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't want to relax...I'm fine,

                     that's what you want.
          
          Christine sees Dr. Steele, breaks away and rushes to him.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Doctor...Doctor Steele --
          
                                  STEELE
                     I heard.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't know what's going on, but
                     I'm not taking anything until --
          
                               STEELE
                     I understand. Come with me.
          
          He moves off into an adjoining room. Carol Dexter, next in
          line, takes her pill...but keeps an eye on Christine.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          He goes to his desk as she stands in the doorway.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't have anything wrong with me
                     that I should have to take
                     medication.
          
                               STEELE
                     There's nothing wrong with you.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's right.
          
                               STEELE
                     You're fine.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Yes.
          
          He pulls a typed letter out of his desk, slides it across.
          
                               STEELE
                     Then you shouldn't have any trouble
                     signing this.
          
          She picks it up, reads as he continues:

                     I won't sign it.

                               CHRISTINE
                     I won't sign it!
          
          She tears up the sheet of paper.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I was not wrong! That boy is not
                     my son! And I am not going to stop
                     telling the truth about this! And
                     you're not going to stop me, and
                     the police aren't going to stop me --

                     Mrs. Collins, you're becoming
                     agitated.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     -- I will tear down the walls of
                     this place with my bare hands if I
                     have to, but one way or another --
                                STEELE
                     Orderly!
          
          An orderly appears in the doorway.
          
                               STEELE
                     The patient is disturbed, hyperactive
                     and is threatening the staff. See
                     to it she is properly sedated.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     No!
          
          She BURSTS past the orderly, running into

          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          running, pursued by orderlies, two more blocking her way.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, I won't let you!     Someone,
                     please, help me!
          
          They TACKLE her and bring her down. She struggles as the
          others look on, and you can see in their eyes that they don't
          like what they're seeing, there's rage --
          
          -- and a furious Carol Dexter comes to her aid. She JUMPS
          into the struggle. Biting. Kicking. Scratching.
          
          Steele comes on the run just as the orderlies peel Carol off
          the fight, spinning her around to face Steele, who SLAPS her.
          
                               STEELE
                     Stay out of this! This is none of
                     your business!
                         (to the rest)
                     This is police business! You'll
                     stay out of it if you know what's
                     good for you!
          
          He looks to Carol, Christine restrained behind them.
          
                               STEELE
                     You'd think you had enough trouble
                     with the law just being a whore,
                     wouldn't you?
          
          He smiles. She gets a hand free and SLUGS him, hard, a nail
          slicing his cheek. He touches his face. It comes back with
          blood. Then he looks to the orderly.
          
                               STEELE
                     Attacking a staff member. Room

                     therapy.
          
          The orderly hauls Carol off, kicking and screaming, as
          Christine is moved toward the nurse's station.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     Carol!   No, leave her alone!    What're
                     you --
          
          They force a pill in her mouth, following with water as they
          hold her nose, forcing her to swallow. She chokes, swallows.
          They march her down the hall as Steele returns to his office.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Carol....!

          INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The electro-shock room. Carol struggles against the orderlies
          who force her down onto the gurney. A nurse behind her applies
          conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a
          rubber bite-guard into her mouth.
          
          Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are
          pressed against her temples. A button is pushed...and her
          body goes RIGID as a jolt of electricity blasts through her
          body. (This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent
          behavior in the 1920s.)
          
          Then she passes out, her eyes rolling up in her head.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Christine is peering out the narrow slot in her door as she
          sees Carol being wheeled down the hall and put into her bed.
          Christine, sobbing, collapses slowly to the floor, caught in
          a nightmare and unable to wake up.
          
                                                    DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Detective Ybarra is sitting at his desk, not happy about a
          lot of his life at this moment. He's turning over the photos
          of the missing kids identified by Sanford Clark and arranging
          them on his desk the way you might arrange cards, playing
          solitaire. He looks up --
          
          -- to see Sanford being led out of one of the holding areas,
          hands cuffed, clothes in his hands. Being transferred to a
          waiting bus. The two exchange a look. Ybarra looks away.
          Sanford continues toward the bus.
          
          Finally, in agony, Ybarra can't take it any more. He rises,
          goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus.
          
                               YBARRA
                     It's all right, I'll take it from
                     here.

                               YBARRA
                     We need him for questioning.   Come
                     on....
          
          He leads Sanford away, then stops two passing officers.

                               YBARRA
                     You two...you've just been
                     requisitioned for backup. I'll
                     explain on the way.
          
          He hurries off.   The officers follow, not sure what's up.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING
          
          Christine sits beside Carol's bed. She's awake but dazed.
          Christine dabs a wet cloth against her forehead.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     You shouldn't have done that.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                         (with difficulty)
                     Wanted...to. Felt...good.
          
          Carol takes her hand, holds it.
          
                                CAROL DEXTER
                     I lost...two babies...to back alley
                     doctors...no choice....
                         (beat)
                     Never had...the chance...to fight
                     for them. You do. Don't stop.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I won't...I won't.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Fuck them...and the horse...they
                     rode in on.
          
          Christine manages a thin smile, despite her tears.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     That's hardly appropriate language
                     for a lady, now is it?
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     Hell, yeah...there are times...that's
                     exactly the right thing to say.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     And when's that?
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     When you've got...nothing left to
                     lose.
          
          Christine touches her face, and we know she's heard this.

          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING
          
          Two squad cars pull up to the ranch. Ybarra and the other
          officers get out, guns up, not knowing if Gordon is still
          there or not.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE: SEPTEMBER 12, 1928
          
          They move quickly through the area, checking the house.
          Everything's dark, silent. One officer runs into the house,
          there's a long pause...then he pokes his head out again.
          
                                  OFFICER
                     All clear.
          
          Ybarra goes back to the car, opens the door.   Sanford emerges.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     All right.     Show me.
          
          Sanford hesitates, then starts toward a nearby barn.
          
          INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
          
          He slides the door open and walks to the far end. The dirt
          here is a strange white-yellow color. Ybarra follows, still
          keeping a wary eye out for trouble. He looks down at where
          Sanford has stopped. Several bags marked LYE are nearby.
          
                                YBARRA
                     This it?   You're sure?
          
          Sanford nods.   Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him.
          
                                  YBARRA
                     Dig.
                         (off sanford's look)
                     You put 'em in the ground, you can
                     take 'em out of the ground. Go on.
          
          Sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of
          dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches,
          pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's
          looking the other way when one of the officers reacts:
          
                               OFFICER
                     Holy god....
          
          Ybarra glances back...to see a child's shoe being unearthed.
          And beside it...bones. And then...a skull.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Call it in...get the coroner and
                     every officer in a twenty mile radius
                     here inside the hour.

                               YBARRA (Cont'd)
                     Then put out an APB on Gordon Stewart
                     Northcott, the info is in my car.
                     Go on....
          
          The officer races out of the barn as Ybarra looks to Sanford,
          who is still digging, crying as he goes.
          
                               YBARRA
                     You can stop now, son.
                         (he doesn't)
                     You can stop now. It's over. We
                     can take it from here. It's over.
          
          Sobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground,
          hands covering his face, crying in great, heaving sobs.
          
                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          The patients are lined up outside their rooms for inspection.
          Steele passes down them in review. Stops in front of
          Christine, who looks exhausted, worn, pale, her eyes
          bloodshot...but still defiant. He glances to the orderlies.
          
                               STEELE
                     Privacy, please.
          
          The orderlies move all of the other patients away, except for
          Christine, who shares a glance with Carol. Several other
          orderlies remain. He glances at her chart in his hands.
          
                               STEELE
                     I see you've still been refusing
                     medication, requiring force-feeding.
                     I see they switched to a rubber
                     tube. I hear that can quite
                     uncomfortable.
          
          She doesn't answer. Her eyes never leave his.     He pulls
          another copy of the letter out of the folder.
          
                                STEELE
                     Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no
                     progress. We may have to go to
                     more...strenuous therapies.
                         (beat)
                     Unless you're willing to prove you're
                     doing better...by signing this.
          
          He holds it up in front of her. She focuses first on it,
          then on him...and finally, her spine where it needs to be
          even if the rest of her is in shambles, looks at him and says:

                               CHRISTINE
                     Fuck you....and the horse...you
                     rode in on.
          
          He nods, shrugs, puts the letter back in the folder.   Turns
          to the orderlies.
          
                               STEELE
                     Room eighteen.
          
          They GRAB her and start muscling her down the hall, Christine
          kicking and screaming as they go. Steele continues out to
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          where he comes through the double-barred door just as Gustav
          Briegleb charges in the front door, carrying a newspaper.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN CHARGE!
                     RIGHT NOW!
          
                               NURSE

                               BRIEGLEB
                     WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE!
          
          Steele approaches.
          
                               STEELE
                     I'm head doctor on duty.   What's
                     the problem?
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     You the doctor who's got Christine
                     Collins locked up in here?
          Intercut with:
          
          INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          They wheel Christine into the room, struggling, fighting
          against the straps that pin her to the gurney.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS
          
          Steele turns away from Briegleb, unconcerned.
          
                               STEELE
                     Sorry, we don't discuss our cases
                     with anyone other than family --
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     You'll damned well discuss this one
                     with me!

                                STEELE
                     Sir --
          
          Briegleb THRUSTS the newspaper into Steele's hands.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     Read it!   Read it, damn you!
          
          Steele unfolds the paper, looks at the headline, which we
          don't see. His reaction, though, is ominous and serious.
          
          INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her
          temples. She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless.
          The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers. Places them on
          Christine's temples. Reaches for the button --
          
          -- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping
          the process. The nurse goes to the one at the controls,
          whispers in her ear. The nurse then says something quietly
          to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold
          Christine to the gurney.
          
                               NURSE
                     The doctor wants to see you.
          
          They pull her up off the gurney.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Christine is ushered inside, where Steele is waiting.    He
          looks upset about something.
          
                               STEELE
                     Mrs. Collins.
          
          She forces herself to stand straight, not easy given what
          she's just been through. He approaches.
          
                               STEELE
                     One last time. Are you, or are you
                     not, prepared to sign that letter?
          
          She looks up into his face, her resolve unshaken, her voice
          dry but firm for:
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     No.
          
          He studies her for one last BEAT, then turns his back.
          
                               STEELE
                     You're free to go.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                      85.
          
          
          Christine takes a moment to process this...not sure if she
          heard this right, or if it's a trick.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     ...what?
          
                               STEELE
                     Your clothes are in the next room.
                     You can change there.
          
          She hesitates a second, looks to the orderly, being careful
          in case this is a set-up.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     Next door.
          
                                STEELE
                     That's right.
                         (to the orderly)
                     See to it.
          
          The orderly nods. She takes one last look around, then gets
          the hell out of the room. Alone, Steele picks up the newspaper
          that had been laying face-down on his desk, looks at it, and
          shakes his head.

          Carol is there as Christine, now in her regular clothes, comes

                     back here...for you, and the others.
                     This is wrong, and we can stop it --
          
                               CAROL DEXTER
                     You are crazy.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Watch me.
          
          They hug. Christine breaks the hug, and hurries away as Carol
          looks on, crying.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Christine comes to the area where she was checked in. No one
          is looking at her. She passes the nurse's station and heads
          toward the door. Opens it. Fresh air comes in. Freedom.
          She steps out the front door as --
          
          -- a moment later, Briegleb passes through the hallway with
          an admissions official, having not seen her.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     You give me every piece of paper
                     you've got on this case, you hear
                     me? Every piece!
          
          The official moves on, nervous, as Briegleb looks to the
          receiving nurse.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     When does she come down?
          
          Before she can answer, we jump out to
          
          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
          Where Christine walks among the sidewalk traffic. Free.
          Vindicated. She starts to pass a news-stand, where a NEWS
          VENDOR is calling out headlines, peddling papers.
          
                               NEWS VENDOR

          The last line stops Christine...just a bad sense that grows
          as she turns to the news vendor, who keeps on going.
          
                                NEWS VENDOR

          Christine's knees buckle as she hears this. She starts to go
          down as Briegleb runs toward her from the hospital.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Mrs. Collins...Christine...!
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No...god...no....
          
          And she collapses into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably, as
          passers-by glance over at her...and continue walking.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I'm sorry...I didn't want you to
                     find out like this...I'm sorry...I'm
                     sorry....
          
          But they're just words.   She doesn't hear them.
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Captain Jones is pacing nervously in the hallway for a long
          BEAT when another officer steps out of an office with a brass
          nameplate that reads CHIEF OF POLICE JAMES E DAVIS.
          
                               OFFICER
                     The chief will see you now.
          
          Jones straightens his tie and steps into
          
          INT. CHIEF DAVIS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          lots of dark wood and filtered light. Davis is sitting at
          his desk, looking at a series of newspapers in front of him
          as Jones steps up and stands before the desk.
          
                               DAVIS
                     I don't know if you're aware of it,
                     Captain, but I have an exceptionally
                     good vocabulary. I'm a terror at
                     Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but
                     even I'm in awe of the vocabulary
                     that the press and the city council
                     have been exercising in reference
                     to this department courtesy of the
                     Christine Collins...incident.
                         (scans papers)
                     Incompetent. Cowardly. Bullying.
                     Reprehensible. Mendacious and
                     invidious...those two courtesy of
                     that prick Gustav Briegleb. Bonus

                     Especially invidious. Hard to work

                     he managed it, all right.

                                 JONES
                     Sir, I --
          
                               DAVIS
                     The key, of course, is the context
                     in which words like this get used.
                     You have to do that in scrabble,
                     you know, when somebody challenges
                     a word...show how it's used in a
                     sentence. So "incompetent," as in --
                         (reads)
                     "A department so incompetent that
                     they never realized that up to twenty
                     children were being kidnapped and
                     murdered under their very noses."
                         (looks over)
                     And here: "So incompetent that they
                     insisted they knew better than a
                     mother the identity of her own child,
                     forced him upon her, and then
                     incarcerated her when she confronted
                     them with evidence of their own
                     reprehensible behavior." That was
                     a two-fer. Incompetent and
                     reprehensible in the same sentence.
                     Guy must be a real terror at
                     crossword puzzles.
          
          Davis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the
          slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside.
          
                                DAVIS
                     Captain, your handling of the Collins
                     case has exposed this department to
                     public ridicule. There is even the
                     potential for civil and criminal
                     liability.
                                JONES
                     Sir, nobody could have known what
                     was going on up at that ranch. Not
                     us, not the Sheriff's Department,
                     the Marshall's Office...as for the

                         (beat)
                     I'm still not convinced that her
                     kid is among the victims up in

                                 DAVIS
                     No?
          
                                 JONES
                     No, sir.

                               JONES (Cont'd)
                     There were four other photos of
                     missing boys that looked a lot like
                     him...this Clark kid could have
                     been mistaken.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Maybe he was...which raises the
                     obvious question: so what?
          
                                 JONES
                     Sir?
          
          Davis turns back to him from the window.
          
                                DAVIS
                     The Mayor wants this to go away. I
                     want this to go away. The way you
                     do that is to stop insisting that
                     Walter Collins was not among those
                     kids killed up at that goddamned
                     ranch. Because if the boy you
                     brought back isn't Walter Collins,
                     and he's not dead up at that ranch,
                     then where the hell is he? People
                     will want to know why we haven't
                     found him. Why we aren't we doing
                     our job.
                         (beat)
                     But if, on the other hand, he is,
                     or could be among those poor boys
                     killed up in Wineville...then the
                     inquiries stop. It's a momentary
                     embarrassment that you'll have to
                     live with...but better a short
                     inconvenience than a lingering
                     problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?
          Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride.   Nods.
          
                                 JONES
                     Yes, sir.
          
                                DAVIS
                     The boy's been gone for nearly a
                     year. If he was going to be found,
                     it would've happened by now. Whether
                     he was up at that ranch or not, the
                     truth is he probably is dead
                     somewhere. Better his mother accepts
                     that now rather than later, don't
                     you think?
          
                                 JONES
                     Yes, sir.

                                 DAVIS
                     Good.    That'll be all, Captain.
          
          Jones starts to leave, then looks back as Davis settles back
          behind his desk.
          
                               JONES
                     Sir, there's talk of an investigation
                     by the police commission.
          
                               DAVIS
                     Let me worry about the commission.
                     But it wouldn't hurt to find out
                     just who the fuck that kid is you
                     brought back from De Kalb and why
                     he did this, because the press bought
                     into his bullshit same as we did.
                     That we were all taken in by the
                     scheming little bastard may help
                     take some of the sting off this.
          
                               JONES
                     My boys are working on it now, sir.
          
          And he exits as we go to
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
          
          Detective Ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad
          in front of him, staring across at "Walter," who isn't very
          happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom.
          His true, nasty personality is free to come out at last.

                     Look, let me explain something to
                     you. Because of your lies, you've
                     ruined a woman's life embarrassed
                     the police department, and got the
                     whole city up in arms over this.
          
          "Walter" considers this for a BEAT, then smiles.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Got a lot done, didn't I?
          
          Ybarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his
          notepad.
          
                               YBARRA
                     All right, if that's how you want
                     it, then I guess we're done here.
                         (to matron)
                     Tell County Jail we're remanding
                     him for trial.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     Wait...what's remanding?    What trial?
          
                               YBARRA
                     I told you, the real Walter Collins

                     So? I didn't do anything! I wasn't
                     even here when it happened!
          
                                YBARRA
                     By pretending to be Walter Collins,
                     you're interfering in a police
                     investigation of a kidnapping and
                     murder. We can try you as an
                     accomplice to murder after the fact.
                         (beat)
                     Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse
                     than juvenile hall or a foster home.
                     A lot worse.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     You can't do that...I'm just a kid!
          
                               YBARRA
                     Sanford Clark is a kid, too.
                     Fifteen. But he's going to jail.
                     All murderers and their accomplices
                     go to jail. Everyone knows that.
                         (to the matron)
                     Get him out of here. It's out of
                     my hands now.

          He heads for the door when "Walter" cries out, scared.
          
                                "WALTER"
                     Wait!   I don't want to go to jail.
          
                                 YBARRA
                     Prove it.
          
          And on the boy's face, we HEAR:
          
                               YBARRA (V.O.)
                     Arthur Hutchins.
          
          INT. JONES' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Ybarra is standing in the doorway to Jones' office, speaking
          to the Captain and looking at his notepad.
          
                               YBARRA
                     The boy's real name is Arthur
                     Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a
                     runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
          
                               JONES
                     Did you check the wire services?
          
          Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Checks out. The report was filed
                     by his divorced mother, who lives
                     in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's
                     grandmother. Apparently he didn't
                     like living with the old lady, she
                     didn't let him get away with the
                     stuff he usually got away with, and
                     one day...he up and left.
                               JONES
                     What about the man he showed up
                     with at the diner?
          
                               YBARRA
                     Just some drifter. The boy was
                     hungry, ran into this guy who said
                     he knew how to get some food and
                     not have to pay for it. Only when
                     they finished, he left the kid behind
                     while he cut out. When the police
                     picked him up, they started going
                     through the wire reports about
                     missing kids --
          
                               JONES
                     And he overheard them say the name
                     Walter Collins.

                                 YBARRA
                     Bingo.
          
                               JONES
                     But why that one? I mean, of all
                     the police departments he could've
                     screwed up, why Los Angeles?
          
                               YBARRA
                     I asked him the same question.

                                "WALTER"
                     I...I knew that Los Angeles was
                     where they made the Tom Mix movies.
                     I figured maybe I could meet Tom
                     Mix. Maybe he'd even let me ride
                     his horse.

                     His horse is named Blue. Did you

          Christine is in a bed in a small room in the rectory, a tray
          beside her, still recovering from her experience. Briegleb
          enters and approaches a nearby chair.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     How are you feeling?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     A little better, thanks. The sleep
                     helped. Anything new outside?
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Nothing that can't wait until you're
                     stronger. The police still have a
                     car parked outside. They want to
                     know what your next move is.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I want to go home.

                     And then?
          
          She takes a BEAT, then slowly, gingerly gets out of bed.

                                CHRISTINE
                     I've been giving that a great deal
                     of thought ever since I got out of
                     that...place. All those women, and
                     what they did about Walter....
                         (beat)
                     They're going to just keep on doing
                     it, aren't they? Nothing's going
                     to change...unless we make it change.
          
          She glances out the window, to the police car parked across
          the street.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I used to tell Walter, "Never start
                     a fight...but always finish it." I
                     didn't start this fight...but by
                     god I'm going to finish it.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     It's dangerous, and you've already
                     been through a great deal, Mrs.
                     Collins. Right now you're
                     sufficiently high-profile that the
                     police will hesitate to come after
                     you out in the open...but if they
                     see their position threatened, that
                     could change quickly.

                     Your life could be in danger.
          
          She takes a beat, then turns to him from the window.
          
                               CHRISTINE

          A series of red-brick rowhouses line a quiet street. We see
          couples walking, hand in hand, kids playing...then we notice
          Gordon Northcott coming around the corner. He looks around,
          then cuts across a yard, jumping over a fence to get to

          She opens the door and finds Gordon Northcott standing outside.
          
                                GORDON
                     Hi, sis.
          
          There's a flicker of a pause...was she expecting him?

                     Gordon...I didn't know you were
                     back in town.
          
                               GORDON
                     Got in a couple of days ago, figured
                     I'd surprise you. That okay?
          
                               RACHEL CLARK
                     Yes...yes, of course. Come on in.
          
          She steps aside as he enters, looks around.
          
                               GORDON
                     Where's that little niece of mine?
          
                               RACHEL CLARK
                     She...went into town. Should be
                     back this evening. Bob's here --
          
                               GORDON
                     Good. Need to talk to him about
                     staying on for a few days.
          
                                  RACHEL CLARK
                     Staying --
          
                               GORDON
                     Listen, can I use your bathroom?
                     It's been a long ride and I could
                     use a shower.
          
                                  RACHEL CLARK
                     Of course.
          
          He passes her and heads upstairs. She steps to the back of
          the house, where her husband, BOB, is coming in through the
          back, wiping engine grease off his hands with a towel.
                                BOB
                     Is that --
                         (she nods, scared)
                     Go next door. I'll call the police.
                     Hurry.
          
          She rushes past him into the other room to do just that.
          
          INT. ROWHOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Gordon is toweling off his hair when he hears a car door slam
          shut. Then another. He peers out the window. Several Royal
          Canadian Mounted Police cars have pulled up along the street.
          Mounties are getting out, moving quietly toward the house.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                     96.
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get
          the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs.
          
          Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above.
          They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon
          fleeing across an adjoining rooftop.
          
                               MOUNTIE
                     Go around the other side!    Cut him
                     off!
          
          The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through
          the broken window in pursuit of Northcott.
          
          EXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT
          
          Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the
          next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES
          blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two
          Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast.
          
          Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance
          between himself and the police on the ground...and making
          increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop
          to rooftop.
          
          He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running.
          The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump
          successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the
          ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first
          Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on.
          
                                SECOND MOUNTIE
                     Go on!   Get the bastard!
          
          He nods and continues the chase.
          Gordon runs for all he's worth.    The Mountie keeps after him.
          
          Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short.
          He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs
          back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to
          shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free --
          
          -- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back
          off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then
          grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming.
          
          Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be
          jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction --
          
          -- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a
          tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking.

          They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going
          over the edge.
          
          With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the
          punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the
          Mountie backs off just a bit --
          
                               MOUNTIE
                     Screw this...I'm too old for this
                     fightin' shit....
          
          -- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the
          two-story roof and DOWN into --
          
          -- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers
          and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned

          As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers
          to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise
          intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose.
          
                               MOUNTIE
                     YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST!
          
          And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers.
          
          INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Christine opens the door to find Reverend Briegleb and another
          man on her porch, S. S. HAHN, late fifties.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a
                     friend of mine, Mr. Hahn.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Hello.
                               HAHN
                     Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences
                     on your loss.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Can we come in?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes...of course.
          
          She steps aside to let them in, closing the door under:
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Mr. Hahn, was it?
          
                               HAHN
                     Yes.

                               CHRISTINE
                     I appreciate the sentiment, but so
                     far they still haven't positively
                     identified any of the...remains...
                     as Walter's.
          
                               HAHN
                     But he was identified, was he not?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Yes, but...I guess I still can't
                     accept it. It doesn't feel real to
                     me.
          
                               HAHN
                     It never does. I lost a daughter
                     to polio five years ago. There's
                     not a day goes by I don't think, I
                     should mention this to Claudine...
                     then I remember she's not here.
          
                                  CHRISTINE
                     I'm sorry.     Please, sit.
          
          They do as Christine looks to Briegleb.
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     I've been on the phone all day with
                     the appointment secretary for the
                     police commission. They won't let
                     me testify at the hearing, or call
                     witnesses. They say it's not
                     necessary.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I know. My sources tell me the
                     police commission is going to come
                     out with a report that whitewashes
                     the whole thing. They're going to
                     say that Jones and the rest of the
                     LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,
                     that the real blame is with the
                     kid...and with you, for being
                     difficult and forcing them to put
                     you away for your own safety.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Then we'll just have to hire a
                     lawyer...bring a civil suit and try
                     to get the City Council to call for
                     a hearing by the Welfare Board.

                     Not one lawyer outside this room
                     was willing to take on the Police
                     Department. Too risky, they said.
                     So finally I went to the very best
                     attorney in town, a man who's sued
                     the city four times and won.
                     Unfortunately, we could never afford
                     to hire him.

                     It would be my honor to defend your

                     years as a lawyer, I have never
                     seen anyone fight as long or as
                     hard as you have, in what is so
                     clearly in the cause of justice.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn
                     here the whole story, from end to
                     end, leave nothing out, he'll need
                     it all if he's going to get the
                     City Council involved.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Of course. One thing, though. A
                     personal favor. When we've finished
                     here today, could you spare a few
                     minutes to come with me downtown.
                                  HAHN

                     won't be in until tomorrow morning

                               HAHN
                     Let me be clearer. Either you open
                     those doors and produce the people
                     named in that court order, or you
                     will find yourself on the other
                     side of those bars...without a key.
          
          The nurse exchanges a sour look with Christine and heads off.

          One by one, the Code Twelve patients are brought out of the
          hospital and into the light. One of the last to emerge is
          Carol Dexter, who blinks against the light, and sees Christine.
          She runs to her, embraces her, sobbing.
          
                               CAROL DEXTER

          And in Christine's face, we see a flicker of pride and one
          simple truth: if she could not save her son, she could at
          least save these women. As they move toward her, Hahn and
          Briegleb, we HEAR a TRAIN WHISTLE that segues us into

                     I've been on a little vacation, as

                     vacation, and the police have
                     certainly provided me with a lot of
                     amusement.

                     Didn't even try. My luggage still

                     I thought this was supposed to go
                     away. This is an election year, I
                     can't afford this kind of press.

                     I'm afraid falling on his sword and
                     saying he made a mistake isn't going
                     to be good enough, Chief. If we
                     take him out of the picture for a
                     while, it might help calm things
                     down until the hearing's finished.

                     force to operate with impunity.

                     Our friends in the press are having
                     a field day with this mess. I'm
                     getting five hundred phone calls,

                     This is a train, Chief, and we need
                     to either get in front of it, or be
                     run over by it.

          Mayor Cryer stands beside Chief Davis and addresses a rather
          noisy and worked-up press corps from behind a podium.
          
                               MAYOR CRYER
                     Gentlemen...gentlemen, please. As
                     Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty
                     to preserve the peace in our city,
                     which has been disrupted by recent
                     events in the case of Christine
                     Collins. As a result, we have
                     decided that Captain J. J. Jones of
                     the Lincoln Heights Division is to
                     be suspended from active duty,
                     effective immediately.

                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     The charge is conduct unbecoming an
                     officer, and using improper and
                     abusive language toward Mrs. Collins.
                     It further charges that he exceeded
                     his authority as a police officer
                     by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on
                     the alleged charge of insanity
                     without sufficient cause.

                     Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the

                     open its own investigation into the
                     Collins case?
          
                               MAYOR CRYER
                     I've heard this, yes. But since
                     one of the main purposes of such a
                     hearing by the City Council would
                     be to suspend Captain Jones, and
                     since that action has now been taken,
                     the question is moot.

                     Which makes it look like the only

          She opens the door as Briegleb enters with three really large,
          dangerous looking men, one of whom is carrying a heavy trench
          coat.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Reverend, what --
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs.
                     Collins, but it took me a while to
                     find the right people for the right
                     job. These three gentlemen are
                     members of my congregation who,
                     before coming to the Lord, had lived
                     lives of brutality, vice and crime.
                     Now they are pledged to doing god's
                     work...and if this isn't it, I don't
                     know what is.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I don't understand.

                     disappearing right before the trial.
                     I'm a big believer in the power of
                     prayer, Mrs. Collins...but a little
                     backup from time to time never hurts.
          
          The others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the
          living room.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I
                     get you anything?
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Since we don't plan on sleeping,
                     coffee would be lovely.
          
          She heads off to get some coffee. As one of the men puts his
          coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off
          shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police
          car sits, watching the house.
          
                                                    DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair
          of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together,
          closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she
          heads out.
          
          EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING
          
          The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car
          with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get
          into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls
          away from the curb, following both cars.
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear
          view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine,
          smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     Traffic's getting heavy.   We'll go
                     up Spring.
          
          He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here
          is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear
          view mirror to see --
          
          -- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting
          off the car with Christine's bodyguards.

          Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's
          too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police
          car glide into position two cars behind them.
          
          Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the
          very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is
          lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then
          there's a momentary break in traffic.
          
                                BRIEGLEB
                     Hold on.
          
          He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts
          off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine,
          who gets out.
          
                               BRIEGLEB
                     Start walking. Quickly.
          
          They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside
          start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being
          right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the
          other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too
          late as --
          
          -- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot,
          Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is
          very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance,
          something that could be the sound of lots of people.
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Almost there. Just a few more
                     blocks.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Where is all this traffic's coming
                     from...?
          Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors,
          and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine
          stops a man passing in the opposite direction.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Excuse me, can you tell me what the
                     problem is up ahead?
          
                               MAN
                     Didn't you hear? It's the biggest
                     protest I've ever seen.
          
                                REV. BRIEGLEB
                     Protest?

          He moves on. Briegleb and Collins slowly exchange a look
          somewhere between disbelief and "oh shit."
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     He didn't mean...he couldn't mean --
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I don't know...all I know is that I
                     think I just stopped breathing....
          
          They walk quickly up one clogged street and down another, the
          police following on foot...moving toward the SOUND of voices,
          drums, and cars honking... until they turn onto Spring Street --
          
          -- and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest
          march ever recorded in the history of Los Angeles to this
          date. Thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming
          the police presence...not rioting, but making their voices
          heard.
          
          The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society

          looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, Mr.
          Harris, marching arm in arm with the rest. He sees her,
          smiles, tips his hat and continues marching.
          
          Christine is stunned...Briegleb even moreso.
          
                               CHRISTINE

          There's no way in hell they can make a move in the face of
          something as big as t his. Briegleb smiles.

                     Boy howdy, does He ever.   Come on.

                     Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any other
                     members of the Police Commission.
          
                               THORPE
                     That's odd...we specifically
                     stipulated that we would begin our
                     hearings with testimony from the
                     police department. Are there any
                     representatives of the Police
                     Commission in the room?
                         (no answer)
                     Is Chief Davis here?
                         (no reply)
                     Is Captain Jones here? Is there
                     anyone here representing the police?

                     Only reason I know is we have a
                     couple of our boys out covering the
                     thing.
          
                                THORPE
                     Are you telling me they directly
                     violated the wishes of the City
                     Council? That they refused to attend
                     a vital hearing so they could conduct
                     a routine inspection in San Pedro?
                     And what the hell is Jones doing at
                     an inspection after being suspended?
                         (beat)
                     I hate to call a recess before we've
                     even started, but I think a few
                     phone calls are in order. So we'll
                     take a half hour break, then continue
                     with the witnesses who have appeared
                     here today. But let it be known
                     that Captain Jones and Police Chief
                     Davis will be subpoenaed and required
                     to appear here tomorrow morning.
          
          There's APPLAUSE from the crowd which breaks up into pockets
          of discussion as a BAILIFF approaches Hahn and whispers into
          his ear. Hahn nods, looks to Christine.
          
                               HAHN
                     Mrs. Collins, could you come across
                     the street with me for just a moment?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     But...shouldn't we --
          
                               HAHN
                     I think there's something you should
                     see.
          Puzzled, curious, Christine gets up and exits with Hahn.
          
          INT. LA COUNTY COURTHOUSE -   HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Hahn is moving quickly down the hall toward a courtroom door,
          Christine following.
          
                               HAHN
                     -- the police decided it was best
                     to keep this off the main docket in

                     chaos we have across the street.
          
          He gets to the door, pauses. Looks back to her.    She nods.
          He opens the door and they enter

          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room.
          As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the
          gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some
          weeping softly. Some of them notice Christine's entrance and
          nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common
          bond...they are all carrying the same grief.
          
          One of the couples, MR. AND MRS. CLAY, see Christine and go
          to her, speaking softly. They should be distinct enough in
          appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see
          them again later.
          
                                MRS. CLAY
                     Mrs. Collins? I'm Leanne Clay,
                     this is my husband, John...I just
                     wanted to pass on my sympathies.
                     What we went through, waiting to
                     hear anything about our son David,
                     was bad enough, and now this....
                         (beat)
                     But there was no call for what the
                     police did to you...no call at all.
          
          She nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom
          opens. They take their seats as a judge and two attorneys
          take their places, preceded by a bailiff.
          
                                 BAILIFF
                     All rise.
          
          They do. The judge takes his seat. The rest of the room
          also sits. He nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another
          door, leading to the holding area.
          
          As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered
          into the courtroom for his initial plea. Some women break
          into tears at the sight of him. He first seems startled by
          the presence of so many, then he smiles. An audience.
          
          As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the
          room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins. Her face pales,
          as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.
          
                               GORDON
                     Hey...I saw you in the papers. You
                     got a lot of moxie, standing up to
                     the police like that.
          
          The bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge.
          Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles
          turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of
          seeing her react to his comments. The judge looks up.

                               JUDGE
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
                     been charged with three counts of
                     murder in the first degree, with an
                     additional seventeen counts under
                     review by the district attorney's
                     office. How do you plea?
          
                               GORDON
                     Not guilty, your honor.
          
          He glances back at his audience.   The bailiff rights him again.
          
                                JUDGE
                     In light of the defendant's penchant
                     for international travel, no bail
                     will be set. This court will receive
                     preliminary motions by tomorrow
                     morning, with a trial date to be
                     set for the earliest opening on the
                     court's calendar.
                         (beat)
                     The defendant is remanded into
                     custody. Bailiff....
          
          The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his
          audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She
          doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction.
          But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes,
          fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says
          nothing. There's nothing to say.

                     We then instituted a nationwide
                     search. On July 10, we received a
                     cable indicating that a boy matching
                     his description had been found in
                     De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning,
                     he admitted to being Walter Collins,
                     and we made arrangements to transport
                     him back to California.

                               JONES
                     Yes. She denied his identity in
                     spite of all evidence pointing to
                     the contrary.

                     But as subsequent events have
                     demonstrated, she was correct. So

                     Whether or not this was in fact the
                     correct boy was not relevant to my
                     decision. Throughout this period,
                     she acted strangely. She was often
                     cool, aloof and unemotional,
                     especially when presented with the
                     boy we located in De Kalb, and in
                     our subsequent conversations. It
                     was because of her disturbing
                     behavior that I submitted her for
                     observation to the psychopathic
                     ward of Los Angeles County General

                     she was already in the asylum!      Is
                     this correct, Captain?
          
                               JONES
                     Technically...yes.
          
          More murmuring from the crowd.
          
                               JONES
                     Extraordinary steps were necessary
                     because we were dealing with an
                     extraordinary situation! Is it our
                     fault that we were being deceived
                     by the boy who claimed to be Walter
                     Collins? No. In light of his claims
                     and her behavior, who wouldn't begin
                     to wonder if there was something
                     wrong with her?
          
                               HAHN
                     Because she questioned you.
          
                                JONES
                     Because she wouldn't listen, because
                     she insisted on being obstinate and
                     taking matters into her own hands
                     best left to qualified officers,
                     because --
          
                               HAHN
                     Because she was fighting for the
                     life of her son! A boy who may
                     have still been alive while you
                     were wasting valuable time denying
                     you had done anything wrong!
          
          This silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin
          drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly.
          
                               HAHN
                     And in the end, that's what happened,
                     isn't it? At some point, while all
                     this was going on, Walter Collins
                     died along with as many as nineteen
                     other youths on the Northcott Ranch
                     in Wineville. Is that correct,
                     Captain?
          
          Jones looks to Chief Davis.   It's a moment.    Then:
          
                                JONES
                     Yes.   It is.
          
          Christine's face falls into her hands.   The place erupts.

          Hahn walks away from a devastated looking Jones.
          
          EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
          
          A small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where
          Chief Davis stands with the Boy who had been "Walter" as a
          train pulls up before them.
          
                                CHIEF DAVIS
                     -- so after much effort, we were
                     able to identify this boy, who was
                     has been responsible for so much
                     recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins
                     of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between
                     this, and the arrest of the man
                     suspected of murdering the real
                     Walter Collins, we have cleared up
                     two of the biggest mysteries in the
                     history of Los Angeles.
                         (beat)
                     I hope that you gentlemen of the
                     press will give as much space to
                     the good things we do as the mistakes
                     that are made on rare occasions.
          
          Just then, he turns as a Matron comes off the train with JANET
          HUTCHINS, middle thirties, the boy's mother.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     Ladies and gentlemen, let me
                     introduce you to the boy's real
                     mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.
          
          She goes to him and hugs him. "Walter" looks like he wishes
          he were somewhere on Mars. Davis moves closer to them to be
          in frame while the FLASHBULBS pop. She's in the same pose as
          they got Christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son.
          
                               MOTHER
                     I hope he hasn't been too much
                     trouble for you.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     Oh, no, not at all....
          
          He towsels the boy's head like he'd like to cut it off. Then
          he nods to an aide, who approaches with a bundle of clothes.
          
                               WRIGHT
                     Mrs. Hutchins...Mrs. Collins, the
                     woman he was staying with, wanted
                     him to have these. They're the
                     clothes she let him wear.

                               MOTHER
                     Well, thank you. Isn't that nice,
                     Arthur? Tell the nice officer thank
                     you.
          
                               "WALTER"
                     I don't want 'em! Give 'em to
                     somebody else!
          
                               DAVIS
                     Precocious little fellow, isn't he?
          
                               "WALTER"
                     It's not my fault! It was the
                     police! They said I was Walter
                     Collins, not me! It wasn't my idea!
          
          She yanks him away.   Davis smiles gamely at the reporters.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     There...blame the police for your
                     own mistakes. We've seen a lot of
                     that lately, haven't we?

          Christine on the stand, speaking quietly.
          
          Officer Ybarra on the stand.

          Christine is sitting on Walter's bed. She runs a hand along
          the sheets, straightening and smoothing them out, her eyes
          moist but not crying. We HEAR a knock on the front door
          downstairs, and the door opening.

          She continues as Briegleb comes up the stairs and enters the
          room. Sees her. Takes off his hat. A show of sympathy.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     When Walter was...when he was here,
                     I'd walk past his bedroom when he
                     was asleep, and even if I couldn't
                     see him, or hear him, I could...feel
                     him in here.

                     Mothers and their children are
                     connected in amazing ways. My uncle
                     joined the army during the big war,
                     and the day he died, before we ever
                     heard a word about it, my grandmother
                     woke up in the middle of the night
                     and said, "Bobby's gone." She
                     just...knew.
          
          Christine nods, taking it in, then:
          
                                CHRISTINE
                     That's why I don't think Walter is
                     dead. I can still feel him, in
                     this room.

                     I know what the police said. But
                     the remains...what they found on
                     that ranch is so...most of it can't
                     even be properly identified. What
                     if that boy made a mistake when he
                     picked Walter's picture?
          
                               REV. BRIEGLEB
                     I understand that you don't want to
                     accept this. What mother does?
                     But you have to let go...and start
                     over. For yourself. He'd want you
                     to move on.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to
                     keep looking. Maybe he's waiting
                     for me, somewhere.

          she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before
          turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of

                     Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a

                       This committee therefore reports
                       and recommends:
                           (beat)
                       First, that the majority members of
                       the Police Commission deserve the
                       severest condemnation for their
                       decision to whitewash the Collins
                       case.

                       verdict of the jury?
          
          The bailiff complies. The judge reads it, hands it back to
          the Bailiff, who brings it back to the Foreman.
          
          INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
          
          As before.
          
                                  THORPE
                       Second, we recommend that the
                       suspension of Captain Jones be made
                       permanent.
          
          Even louder applause, some cheering. The pattern continues

                               GORDON
                     Yeah, I want to make a statement.
                     I want to make it real clear that I
                     never once got a fair shake from

                     -- 'cause she's the only one never

                     didn't do and throw you in the hole.

          The defense attorney yanks Gordon around to face the judge.
          
                               JUDGE
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the

                     will be conveyed to San Quentin
                     Prison, where you will be held in

                     of two years, until October 2nd,

          Christine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day
          out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes
          out, followed by several reporters.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     -- no, as I said after the hearing,
                     I have every intention of finishing
                     my term as Chief of the Los Angeles
                     Police Department. I will not
                     resign. I will fight to the finish.
                     The Collins case was merely an excuse
                     for certain politicians who have
                     been trying to have me removed for
                     some time, and I --
          
          He pauses as he sees Christine.    Looks away and continues in
          a lowered voice.
          
                               CHIEF DAVIS
                     -- anyway, I remain confident that
                     the Mayor's office will stand firmly
                     behind me. That's all.
          
          The press continue after him, not really noticing Christine,
          who takes one last look around at it all...and walks slowly
          away. Alone.

          Christine, alone, rides the street car to work. The car stops
          in front of a school. Walter's school. She looks out the
          window, to where children are playing. Then looks away again
          as the street-car starts moving again.

          Christine is back at work again, as she had been, though some
          of the light has gone out of her eyes. She moves from station
          to station, nodding her approval or checking off forms. She
          glances to the clock, it's a little after two, then goes to
          Mr. Harris, who has just come out onto the floor.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                     Of course.
          
          She starts away, turning at:
          
                               MR. HARRIS
                     You know...one of these days you
                     might consider actually taking one
                     of these ten minute breaks. Might
                     be good for you.

                     We'll see.     Thanks, Ben.
          
          She heads off toward a back room. He watches her go with a
          combination of awe, respect and deep sadness.

                     Yes, hello, this is Christine
                     Collins, we spoke yesterday about
                     my son...fine, thank you. I was
                     wondering if you'd had a chance to
                     go through the file on runaways in
                     your area in case anyone resembling

                     I see. No, thank you, I appreciate
                     the information. Would it be all
                     right if I called you again, in a

          He's heard part of the conversation, and there's a sadness in
          his eyes.
          
          She starts to dial again when he knocks on the door.     She
          turns to see him, mid-dial.

          His tone is grave, and she knows that something's happened.
          She hangs up the phone, missing the cradle the first time.

                     It's about Walter. We had...well,
                     we received a very strange telegram.

                                HAHN
                     He said he knows you're still looking
                     for your son, and before he dies --
                         (beat)
                     He says that he lied when he
                     testified that he didn't kill Walter.
                     He's willing to finally admit that
                     he did it. He says that if you
                     come up to see him, in person...he'll
                     tell you the truth, to your face...so

          we HEAR footsteps approaching down the hall. A moment later,
          a PRISON GUARD escorts Northcott into the room. Northcott
          nods to Christine, then glances to the guard, who looks to

                     there's thirteen steps going up to

                     coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes
                     and green beans. I always wondered

                     they make sure you got something in
                     you when it happens. They like
                     knowing you fouled yourself on the

                     Sure you don't got a cigarette?
          
          She shakes her head.   He nods absently for a moment.

                     The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a
                     good guy. He's writing a book about
                     all the death sentences he's carried
                     out in this place. Says it's called
                     "Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women."
                     Beats my record all to hell.

                     Mr. Northcott...you asked me to
                     come to see you. You said if I
                     did, you would tell me the truth
                     about my son. Well, I'm here.
          
                               GORDON
                     Yeah...yeah, you are. But see, the
                     thing is, I didn't think you'd really
                     come, and now --

          He's pacing, growing more agitated and scared.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                     Now what?
          
                                GORDON
                     I didn't expect....
                         (beat)
                     I don't want to see you.

                     What?
          
                                GORDON
                     I can't do this...I can't talk to
                     you...not today, not tonight, not
                     with what they're going to do to
                     me. It's one thing to send a

                                 CHRISTINE
                     Why not?
          
                               GORDON
                     Because I don't want to die with a
                     lie on my lips!
          
          He turns from her, in anguish...but is he just playing her?

          
                               GORDON
                     I did my penance, I asked God to
                     forgive me for my sins...and I've
                     been good, ever since...if I commit
                     a sin now, if I lie now...I'm out

          She goes around to him, faces him.

                     Mr. Northcott...look at me.

                     Look at me.
          
          He turns almost against his will...meets her eyes.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you...kill...my son?
          
          His eyes go wide and he CRIES OUT, stumbling back and away
          from her.

          The guard enters, going to Northcott.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     No, wait, please --

                     It's okay, ma'am, they always get a
                     little nuts the day of.
          
          She pushes past him to Northcott, grabs the front of his shirt.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Did you kill him? Did you kill my
                     son?
          
          He screams in anguish, and the guard hauls him out, closing
          the door after him. Christine tries to open the door, but it
          won't open.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott!
          
          She slowly slides to the floor, crying as we HEAR the SOUND
          of CHAINS clanking, and we....

          INT. EXECUTION AREA - NIGHT
          
          The door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is
          led into the area with the scaffolding. The Warden is there,
          waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain.
          
          Several other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in
          the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows
          area by a large plate glass window. Christine is among the
          parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for
          strength. Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one
          side.
          
          Northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to
          the warden at the base of the gallows. A clock reads 9:50.

                               WARDEN
                     Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
                     been found guilty of murder, the
                     penalty for which is death by
                     hanging. There have been no stays
                     or reprieves, therefore the execution
                     will go forward as stipulated under
                     the laws of the State of California.
                     Do you have any last words?
          
                               GORDON
                     No...nothing.
                         (to chaplain)
                     I kept clean after I confessed,
                     reverend...just like I said I would.
          
          The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards,
          who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows.
          
                               GORDON
                     Will it...will it hurt?
                         (no reply)
                     Please...not so fast...don't make
                     me walk so fast!
          
          They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the
          last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs
          together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.
          
                               GORDON
                     Thirteen steps...thirteen steps...
                     but I didn't touch all of 'em, you
                     bastards...I didn't touch all of
                     'em!
          
          They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure
          the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.
                               GORDON
                     A prayer! Please, somebody, say a
                     prayer for me!
          
          The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner
          approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden
          looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in
          a terrified, shaking voice:
          
                               GORDON
                     Silent night...holy night...all is
                     calm...all is bright...round yon
                     virgin mother and child...holy infant
                     so tender and mild --
          
          Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the
          lever and the trap door JERKS OPEN.

          Northcott FALLS through the door six feet then there's a
          SNAP...and the body bounces in SLOW MOTION at the end of the
          rope...as we HEAR the sound of his heart
          slowing...slowing...until it finally stops.
          
          Christine covers her eyes. There is no cheering in the witness
          room. Only the sound of weeping.

          Slowly, the witnesses exit the prison. We find Christine
          among them. She nods good-night to some of them, including
          the Clays, then starts off on her own, heading into the night.

                       Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No,
                       of course I remember you, how are
                       you? Is everything --
          
          She freezes at something she hears.

          Christine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirror
          that looks out into an interview room. Mr. and Mrs. Clay are
          already there. In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and a
          young boy, DAVID, age 13. Mrs. Clay sees her, and they
          embrace.
          
                                 MRS. CLAY
                       I wanted to go to him right off,
                       but they said it was important to
                       talk to him alone first.
          
                                 CHRISTINE
                       Are they sure it's --
          
                                  MRS. CLAY
                       They're sure, but more important,
                       I'm sure.
                           (beat)
                       It's my boy, all right...it's David.
                       He's alive, Christine. They found
                       him up in Hysperia.
          
                                    CHRISTINE
                       But how --
          
          Mr. Clay motions for them to shush. They turn their attention
          to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes.

                               YBARRA
                     All right, so after you got into
                     the car, what happened next?
          
                               DAVID
                     They drove me around for a long
                     time, then we ended up at this ranch --
          
          EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
          
          David is shoved into the chicken coop. Several other BOYS
          are already there, scared, crying. They lunge at the door,
          trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces.
          
          They scream, trying to get out.   Gordon SLAMS an arm against
          the door, scaring them.
          
                               GORDON
                     SHUT UP!
                         (grinning)
                     I'll see you boys later....
          
          He laughs and moves off, Sanford accompanying him, looking
          very guilty.
          
                               YBARRA (V.O.)
                     Were there other boys present?
          
                               DAVID (V.O.)
                     Yeah...six, I think. It was a long
                     time ago.
          
                               YBARRA (V.O.)
                     Did you speak to them? Do you
                     remember any of their names?
          
          INT. CHICKEN COOP - LATER
          PANNING the boys huddled against one wall, scared.
          
                                DAVID (V.O.)
                     Yeah...two of them were brothers, I
                     think their last name was Winslow,
                     something like that. The oldest
                     was Jeffrey, I think he was around
                     eleven....
                         (beat)
                     ...and Walter.
          
          We STOP PAN on the last kid...on Walter Collins, at last.

                               YBARRA
                     Do you remember his last name?

          Christine covers her face.     Can barely stand up.
          
                               YBARRA
                     So if you only remember some of the
                     names of the rest, how come you
                     remember his full name?
          
                               DAVID
                     Because of what happened.
          
          INT. CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT
          
          Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner,
          talking quietly, urgently.
          
                               DAVID (V.O.)
                     Walter and Jeffrey were talking
                     when everybody else was screaming.
                     They were scared, same as the rest
                     of us, but they weren't scared
                     stupid. They kept checking around
                     until they found a part of the coop
                     where the chicken wire was all messed
                     up.
          
          They pull at the wiring.    Part of the roof weakens and dust
          sifts down.
          
                               DAVID (V.O.)
                     They figured we might be able to
                     yank the chicken wire and bring
                     down the corner, maybe make enough
                     room to get out of there and run...
                     but it would make an awful lot of
                     noise and if it wasn't wide enough,
                     we'd be stuck. It might even bring
                     the whole place down.
          
                               WALTER
                     We gotta try it!

                               JEFFREY
                     We have to get out of here!
          
                               FIRST WINSLOW BOY
                     I'm afraid!
          
          And in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he
          saw her:
          
                                WALTER
                     I'm not. I'm not afraid of
                     anything.
                         (beat)
                     Don't you want to go home? Don't
                     you want to see your mom again?
          
          The Winslow kids nod, and start crying.   Jeffrey and Walter
          look to the rest.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Anybody else?
          
          David holds up his hand.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to
                     come, get over at that end in case
                     this comes down.
          
          The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end,
          too terrified to try and escape. Jeffrey, David and Walter
          go to the weakened corner of the coop.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     When we get out, we split up, go in
                     different directions, they can't
                     catch all of us. Ready?
          They nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the
          wire framework.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Pull!
          
          They do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the
          ceiling SHIFTS above them, dirt falling all over the place...
          they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still
          pulling...then suddenly --
          
          -- the corner FALLS AWAY, part of the roof starting to come
          down with it. The NOISE is substantial.
          
                               JEFFREY
                     Go!

          They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, then
          David...but just as the first two get clear --
          
                               DAVID
                     Help!
          
          Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go on
          around the ranch. He hesitates...then RUNS back to David,
          helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEET
          running their way.
          
                               DAVID
                     Hurry!
          
          Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the
          coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first
          one, then the other. They RUN --
          
          -- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running,
          heading for the line of trees....

                     So you don't know if either of the
                     other two were captured?
          
                               DAVID
                     No. All I know is, if he hadn't
                     come back for me...I don't think I
                     ever would've gotten out of there.
          
                               YBARRA
                     What happened after that?
          
                               DAVID
                     I hid in the woods for two days,
                     too scared to move, because I was
                     sure they'd find me. I finally
                     started walking, but every time a
                     car came up I was afraid it was
                     them. So I kept off the main roads
                     until I saw a train stopped at a
                     crossing, and I jumped in.

                                 DAVID
                     I was afraid! I thought they'd
                     come after me, or my folks...so I
                     didn't tell anybody. I was on my
                     own until I got a free meal from
                     this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told
                     her I was an orphan, on my own.
                     She said I could stay on, and...I
                     did.
                          (beat)
                     Every night, I'd wake up, thinking
                     they were right outside my window.
                     Then I heard the police talking on
                     the radio about what happened at
                     the ranch, and I thought, for sure
                     I can't go back now.
          
                                YBARRA
                     Why not?
          
                               DAVID
                     Since I didn't tell anybody what
                     happened, I was afraid they'd blame
                     me for those kids being dead. So I
                     just...stayed away.
          
                               YBARRA
                     So what made you come forward now,
                     after all this time?
          
          David looks away, his eyes tearing up.   Finally:
          
                               DAVID
                     I miss my mom...I miss my dad...I
                     just...I just want to go home.
          
          And it's all Mrs. Clay can take. Sobbing, she runs out of
          the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes
          to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into
          one another's arms.

          Christine and Ybarra watch as Mr. and Mrs. Clay lead their
          son into their car. As they drive off, Christine finally
          breaks the silence.
          
                               YBARRA
                     Still can't believe it. Five years,
                     case closed, everyone thinks he's
                     dead...and there he is.

                     And he wouldn't be, if it wasn't

                     Your son did a brave thing, Mrs.
                     Collins. You should be very proud
                     of him.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     I am.

                     You don't think he's still out there,
                     do you?
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Why not? Three boys made a run for
                     it that night, Detective. If one
                     got out, maybe either or both of
                     the others did too. Maybe Walter
                     went through the same fears he did.
                     Afraid to come home or identify
                     himself, afraid he'd get into
                     trouble, that people might think it
                     was his fault. Either way, it gives
                     me something I didn't have before
                     tonight.
          
                               YBARRA
                     What's that?
          
          She looks at him...and smiles.
          
                               CHRISTINE
                     Hope.
          
          She turns and walks off into the night, as we SUPERIMPOSE:
          
          
          Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935
          
          In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford
          Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for
          Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned
          home to Canada, and was never heard from again.
          
          Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.
          Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by
          Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and
          fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never
          paid.
          
          One year after the City Council recommended the removal of
          the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from
          office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.
          
          CHANGELING A True Story                                  139.
          
          
          Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red
          Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices,
          but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police
          corruption.
          

          In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal
          justice system in California was revised to prevent women
          from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of
          disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical
          procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.
          
          In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted
          out of office after three terms. He was later found to have
          been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate,
          which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern
          California.
          
          For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used
          his radio show to expose police misconduct and political
          corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of
          Daniel."
          
          The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became
          synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order
          to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name
          to Mira Loma.
          
          
          
          Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.
          
          
          
          The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able
          to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today.

A1   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1

     CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET
     BRIDGE."

     ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
     control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

     It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
     THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

     THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and
     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE
     DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.

     A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
     camera...

                          KAREN CROSS
                ... Police on scene are approaching
                the suspect. They're at the center of
                the Bridge now.

     The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The
     Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

     SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING
     OUT!

2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2

     A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
     HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
     watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
     TONIC, is...

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
     trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
     The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

     IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
     most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)

                After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty
                for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.

     The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
     MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.

                          JENKINS
                In a civilized society, the men and
                women entrusted with serving and
                protecting the community are to be held
                accountable just like everyone else.
                Simply put... Just because you are a
                cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
                you. This is no longer the wild, wild
                west.

     stares at the photo, finishes his drink.

     A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms

     FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...

     ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.

     LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
     merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
     HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!

     Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
     Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...

     Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,

     PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the

     Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...

     AT THE FRONT DOORS--

     The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move
     into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he
     aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT
     RINGS OUT!

                          LOREN
                Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden
                moves!
                    (to the Tellers)
                You! Hands on heads, drop to your
                knees. Now! Do it!

     PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in
     COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

     BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
     counters! One on one side, one on the other.

     BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
     them into the lobby!

     BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
     level, forces them downstairs.

     From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand
     creeps toward his gun.

                          LORENZ
                That... you don't want to do.

     The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
     the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
     drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

     Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to
     Black Clad #2!

                           LORENZ

                 You understood what I just said?

                              BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.

                           LORENZ
                 Your security system, you can
                 electronically lock all entrances...

                            BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.   Right-right away.

                           LORENZ
                 With that attitude, you and I are going
                 to get along famously. Now go.

      The Bank Manager nods nervously.

      BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the
      CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.

10A   INT.   BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE                                10A

                 It's done.     We're locked down.

11    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                       11

      Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him...

      HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon
      with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around
      her.

                           JENKINS
                 Have you seen my watch?

      Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
      watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
      love, this is a relationship of convenience.

      Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
      last check in the mirror...

                           JENKINS
                 This was fun. You should get out of
                 bed. You'll be late for work.

      And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to
      close, then collapses back onto the bed.

12    INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK             12

      PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety
      deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies
      the detonation device and...

                 Fire in the hole.

      He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH
      THE VAULT!

13    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                            13

      A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands
      UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.

      BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--

      An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and
      PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         7.


      BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his
      weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS
      profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

      Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.

                           LORENZ
                 What do you think you're doing?

                           BLACK CLAD #4
                 Fucker pushed the alarm.

      Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.

                            LORENZ
                 It would've made more sense to shoot
                 him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
                 Not after.
                     (looks at the Eager Teller)
                 Jesus.

      Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
      head and...

                           LORENZ
                 And... If you're going to do something.
                     (FIRES his weapon!)
                 Do it right.

      The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks
      his watch... 9:26 a.m.

                           LORENZ
                     (into microphone)
                 Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock.

      There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel
      clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off
      the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off
      screen, chimes!

16    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                                16

      SIRENS BLARE... POLICE CARS brake hard, blocking traffic.
      OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out!

      HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the
      CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things...

      DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not
      a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow
      him.

                           CALLO
                     (into his radio)
                 I want all points of entry identified
                 and covered. We need SWAT here now.

      POV OF LORENZ - Callo approaches the Tech Van.

      Lorenz peeks through the curtains.       A phone pressed between
      his shoulder and ear.

      He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this
      will leave his voice sounding LIFELESS and DISTORTED to those
      on the receiving end).

18   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                              18

     Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN.    So state-of-the-art
     NASA is green with envy.

     BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,
     hands Callo a phone. Several other OFFICERS listen in.

                          DAX
                We have them on the line.

     Dax presses a series of buttons.

                             DAX
                We're hot.

                          CALLO
                    (into phone)
                This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.
                Who am I speaking with?

                          LORENZ
                No questions. It's time to set the
                rules. I am in complete control of
                this facility. No one gets in or out
                without my say and I will execute every

                I'm listening.

20   INT.   CONNERS APARTMENT - DAY                                   20

     Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his
     refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the
     door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his
     deck.

     Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
     SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
     to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a
     long beat...

                          CONNERS
                Do you have a warrant?

          I need to speak to you, Quentin.

                    CONNERS
          There's where your shit out of luck
          because I don't need to speak to you.

                    JENKINS
          It's important.

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE
STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.

                    JENKINS
          Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.

                     CONNERS
          Huh? You don't look like much of a
          Detective.

                     DEKKER
          Funny. I was going to say the same
          about you.

                      CONNERS
          Charming.

                    JENKINS
          Shane just transferred in from Tacoma.      His
          father...

                    CONNERS
          Save your breath. I really don't care.

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has
passed...

                    CONNERS
          Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to

          No shit.   I need you to do this.

                    CONNERS
          Why should I?

                    DEKKER
          Because people's lives are at stake.
          That takes priority over your ego.

                    CONNERS
              (to Jenkins; re: Dekker)
          You may want to put a leash on him.

          Saying I did want to help... I'm still
          suspended or did that slip your mind?

                    JENKINS
          The commissioner's office has ordered
          me to reinstate you. As of now, you're
          back on the force.

                    CONNERS
          Just like that?

                     JENKINS
          Just like that.
              (beat)
          I won't, however, unleash you alone.

                    CONNERS
          Always a catch.

                    JENKINS
          Shane, here, is your new partner.
          Consider him a younger version of me,
          looking over your shoulder, watching
          every move you make.

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.

                    JENKINS
          Don't think I endorse this. If it were
          my call, you'd be with your partner...

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair
still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a
middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop.

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.

                SWAT, because of the special
                circumstances will defer to Conners.
                He's in charge.

                          VINCENT
                First time I've heard SWAT defer to
                anyone.

                          JENKINS
                    (pulls aside Conners)
                Second chances don't come around often.
                Don't blow it.

     Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away.     He
     motions for Dekker to walk with him.

                          JENKINS
                Anything questionable happens today,
                you let me know.

                          DEKKER
                Yes, Captain.

     Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.

                          TEDDY
                Looks like you got yourself a baby-
                sitter.

     Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then
     dismisses the comment.

     More SPECTATORS, more MEDIA.

     Conners, Dekker, Teddy and Vincent hover behind the first
     barricade. Conners unwraps gum, sticks it in his mouth.

                          VINCENT
                We have approximately four to seven,
                heavily armed men holding an
                unspecified number of customers and
                employees hostage.

                Witnesses heard shots fired and some
                kind of explosion. And their only
                demand has been to speak with you.

                I'm sure it won't be the last. Get me
                a line into the bank. Let's see what
                they really want.

     A PHONE RINGS...

     Lorenz enters, shuts the door and REMOVES HIS MASK.    He lets
     a few rings pass, before ANSWERING.

                          LORENZ

                Detective Conners?

     INTERCUT WITH:

29   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             29

     Conners and company gather outside of the Police Tech Van.
     Dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes.

     Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.

                          CONNERS
                Who am I speaking with?

                             LORENZ
                For now...     You can call me Lorenz.

     Dekker writes, "Lorenz."

                          CONNERS
                Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?
                Can we get you anything? Food, medical
                supplies. We heard an explosion.

                          LORENZ
                Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
                I would've preferred not having the
                authorities involved at all. We weren't
                planning to be here this long. But, since
                Seattle's finest needs a presence on the
                scene, I'm glad it's you.

                    CONNERS
          My fame proceeds me.

                     LORENZ
          Don't be flattered. I needed someone
          who's been through the experience
          before. Hopefully this time it will go
          better for all involved. I plan on
          living a full, long and rich life. I
          didn't, however, expect them to find
          you so quickly. I thought you were
          suspended.

Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.

                    CONNERS
          I was, but I'm back.   You're
          information's old.

                    LORENZ
          You never get what you pay for.
              (back to business)
          You want to know about the hostages?
          How many and are they okay?

Dekker scribbles, "Pro".

                    CONNERS
          Yes.

                     LORENZ
          Approximately forty, they're fine,
          considering. All except one. We had a
          situation.

                    CONNERS
          Someone's dead?

                    LORENZ
          Theory... put to practice isn't always
          perfect. Can't expect to keep the
          hostages in check if a bad deed goes
          unpunished or they may... randomly
          decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
          order to it.
              (Conners drifts in thought)
          Detective? Are you still with me?

Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.
There's a new intensity to his demeanor.

                    CONNERS
          What else will I be looking for?

                Demands... Probably too much to ask
                for you and your colleagues to pack up
                and go home?

                          CONNERS
                Safe to say.

                          LORENZ
                Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you
                shortly.

                            CONNERS
                Lorenz...

                          LORENZ
                Don't worry, I have no plans until
                sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's
                going to be a long one.

                          CONNERS
                Wait, we're talking here...

                          LORENZ
                Patience, Detective. We don't want
                another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?

     Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.
     Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.

                            DAX
                He's off.

      Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys,
      an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun.

      #1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the
      wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear,
      repeats.

                 Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.

                           CONNERS
                 So you're here in his place.

      Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks
      another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.

                           CONNERS
                 Nicotine gum.

                    VINCENT
          Wasting our time.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it
together.

                    CONNERS
          Precisely. He knows police protocol,
          not to mention the shit in our own
          precinct. He's disguising his voice,
          means he's got a record and has done
          this before. He's heavily armed and
          well-connected. He knows he's
          surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
          damned thing. He drops that hint about
          sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
          He's buying time. Why?

                    VINCENT
              (brainstorming)
          To figure out his next move.    He wasn't
          expecting us.

                    DEKKER
          No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,
          he thought you were still suspended.

                    CONNERS
          Probably thought it would take the
          whole day for you to find me. Giving
          him the time he needs.

                    TEDDY
          He's stalling.

                    DEKKER
          He almost has what he came for.

Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.

                    CONNERS
          Or... he's got what he came for and he's
          waiting for his ticket out of here.
              (the decision)
          We're going in.

                    TEDDY
          What?

                     CONNERS
          The bank has three points of entry.
          Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,
          head to the West side. We'll have the
          SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,
          you're with me. Where is the SWAT
          Commander?

                    VINCENT
          I'll find him.

Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.

                    TEDDY
              (to Conners; concern)
          That's a big call, Quentin.   Thought
          about what you're doing?

                    CONNERS
          You questioning me, Teddy?

                    TEDDY
          Unfortunately... yeah.

                    CONNERS
          I question how you can fuck that
          asshole and still manage to look in the
          mirror.

                    TEDDY
          I'm not going to get into this now.
          And you're one to talk. I hear...

                    CONNERS
              (interrupting)
          The hostages are in imminent danger.
          They've confessed to killing someone, an
          automatic murder one charge - that's a
          life sentence, maybe a needle for all of
          them. So why keep witnesses around to
          testify? Longer we wait, the greater the
          risk. We need to go in. Now.

                    (beat; then relents)
                Okay.

     Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives
     with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a
     "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                I got snipers up top and ten soldiers

                What's the best way in?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                Tear gas, blow the doors...

                           CONNERS
                Hold on. No explosives. I got forty
                civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any
                other way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                There's no pussy way in. The doors are
                locked electronically from the inside.
                We ain't getting in without force.

                    (beat; thinks)
                What if we cut the power? That will
                disable the system and we can open the
                locks manually, come in that way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                    (thinks; concedes)
                That'll work.

                          CONNERS
                So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.
                We cut the power and go in at 11:15

                  "go", understood?

       They all nod.    They're ready.

                            CONNERS
                  You have done this before, right?
                  Wait... I don't want to know.

33     INT.   SIDE OFFICES - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                    33

       VARIOUS SHOTS of HOSTAGES. It's quiet, until... Black Clad
       #1 and #4 burst, grab TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, drag them out!
       They put up some fight, but quickly concede.

       The hostages sit shaking, crying...    Scared beyond belief.

34     INT.   BEHIND CUSTOMER SERVICE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK         34

       Lorenz watches out the window...

       POV OF LORENZ - SWAT, POLICE getting into position.

       Lorenz turns from the window.

                  They're comin'.

       Black Clad #1 and #4 drag the TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, KICKING
       AND SCREAMING, towards the anchor/pulley!

                            RANDOM HOSTAGE #1
                  What are you doing?! Let me go!

       #1 & #4 fasten the Hostages to ropes connected to the
       pulleys!

35   EXT.   FRONT ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY            35

     Behind a barricade, Conners crouches down beside Dekker and
     his SWAT Team.

                          CONNERS
                    (into radio)
                Let's go around the horn.

36   ON THE WEST SIDE--                                              36

     Teddy, Vincent and a SWAT Team...

                          TEDDY
                One, check.

     The SWAT Commander and his team...

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                Two, check.

     A SNIPER holds his eye to the scope.

                Three, check.

41   AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE--                                          41

     Conners glances at his watch...

                          CONNERS
                Here we go... Cut the power.

42   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                   42

     Instantly...   EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT!   LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc.

     THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz
     and the Black Clad calmly react.

43   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                   43

     Conners makes the call...

                 Doors!

      Each Team makes their move, when...

                        (into his headset)
                 Now!

44A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                           44A

      Black Clad #1 PULLS A CORD, instantly...     ALL THE CURTAINS
      DROP!

45    EXT.   MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                    45

      Conners freezes...

                           CONNERS
                     (into radio)
                 Hold it. What just happened?

45A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                           45A

      Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached
      to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their
      feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR!

      They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
      then...

45B   EXT.   MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY             45B

      SHOOT to the TOP OF THE WALL-LENGTH WINDOWS! They hang,
      dangle helplessly! On FULL DISPLAY for the outside to see!

                           DEKKER
                     (looking up at the windows)
                 Holy shit...?!

      DEKKER. CONNERS. SWAT. ONLOOKERS.       Everyone in the
      vicinity react in HORROR!

      THE NEWS CREWS, led by Karen Cross, race to grab the story.

      The SWAT Commander:

      Officers try to control the situation, but can't.
      Pedestrians racing around. Conners, in the middle of the
      anarchy...

                             CONNERS
                 No.    Do not go in.   It's a trap!

                           SWAT COMMANDER (VO)
                 Stand down, Detective. This is my show
                 now.

                           CONNERS
                     (flustered)
                 SONOFABITCH!

      The SWAT Commander makes his own call...

                           SWAT COMMANDER
                 On my count... One... two... three...

      The SWAT TEAM bum rushes the bank, just as...

      KABOOM!   A FIREBALL BLASTS through the door, BLOWS off its
      hinges!   The SWAT guys are blown off their feet! Then...

48A   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                           48A

      THE FRONT WINDOWS BLOW OUT! AN EXPLOSION! FIRE SHOOTS IN
      ALL DIRECTIONS! A POLICE BARRICADE BLOWS OVER!

      Everyone outside is BLOWN OFF THEIR FEET! Conners, Dekker
      HIT THE DECK! SHARDS OF GLASS FLY! SMOKE FLOODS INTO THE
      STREETS!

      Simultaneously, An EXPLOSIONS BLASTS OUT THE WEST SIDE DOORS!
      THE DETECTIVES AND SWAT TEAM DUCK FROM THE BLAST!

49    ACROSS THE STREET--                                               49

      THE BLACK CLAD'S TRUCK EXPLODES, FLIPS IN THE AIR!

      It's a genuine WAR ZONE!    SMOKE, FIRE AND DEBRIS LITTER THE
      AREA AROUND THE BANK!

50    FROM THE BANK--                                                   50

      Conners peers up as...    The HOSTAGES RUN OUT, SCREAM IN
      TERROR!

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004              26.


     Conners and Dekker head for the bank, pass two groups of FOUR
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS...

                          DEKKER
                    (to the first group)
                Round up all the hostages, anyone that
                comes out, grab'em!

     Conners glares at Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the second)
                The rest of you, come with us.

     The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to
     safety. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS pounce on the
     opportunity.

     Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.

51   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                              51

     EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,
     Dekker and the Officers move through. Caution with each
     step.

     The lobby's clear.   Conners pulls the Officers close.

                          CONNERS
                    (whispers; to Dekker)
                We split up.
                    (whispers; to the officers)
                You two with him. You two with me.
                    (to Dekker)
                Check the back.

     Dekker nods, leads his group away.      Conner proceeds...

52   BEHIND THE COUNTERS--                                              52

     Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank
     Employees Only."

53   THE VAULT--                                                        53

     Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the
     explosion remain. Suddenly... THE GENERATORS ROAR TO LIFE!
     THE POWER BLINKS BACK ON!

     Dekker jumps, startled by the sudden blast of lights.

      ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP, as...   Conners KICKS IN THE DOOR,
      but... It's empty.

55    A BANK CORRIDOR--                                              55

      Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS
      CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...

      A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,
      carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy
      EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.

55A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                        55A

      Conners strides out from behind the counters...

                           CONNERS
                     (to Vincent)
                 See anyone come your way?

                            VINCENT
                 No.   No one went by me.

      The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK
      MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.

                           SWAT COMMANDER
                 Detectives... We found these.

      Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.

                           CONNERS
                 We let them walk right past us.

      Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the
      SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED.
      Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally...

                            CONNERS
                 SHIT!

                                                         TIME CUT TO:

56    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY                 56

      An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE
      around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under
      control.

      Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS
      administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body
      into their truck.

     Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.

                          VINCENT
                We got the one Teller dead, the two
                that were strung up are alive, but in
                critical condition. A few SWAT
                incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's
                the worst of it. Now, depending on who
                you talk to... there was anywhere from
                five to nine perps. And nobody got a
                good look at any of'em, wore their
                masks the whole time. Dax is rounding
                up the security tapes now. That should
                give us a firm number.

                          CONNERS
                I want background checks on every
                hostage. They're all suspects until
                they're not.

                          VINCENT
                You don't think one of them's still
                here?

                          CONNERS
                After this, nothing would surprise me.

58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58

     Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside
     with them. Dekker approaches.

                          DEKKER
                Excuse me... I need to listen to the
                conversation between Lorenz and Conners
                again?

                          DAX
                It'll have to wait.

                            DEKKER
                How long?

                           DAX
                Hour.   Maybe more.

                          DEKKER
                    (too long)
                Show me how to play it myself?

                          DAX
                Look, this isn't how it works. I don't
                take orders from you. I don't know you
                and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're
                going to have to wait.

     Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds
     into the van. Dax turns, notices.

59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59

     Dekker inspects the equipment, when...

                          DAX
                What the hell are you doing?

                          DEKKER
                Along with whatever they stole and this
                war zone they left behind... A man's
                dead, and the killers are running free.
                I don't have time to wait.
                    (looks at the equipment)
                I'll figure it out. Thanks for your
                help.

                          DAX
                    (relents, demonstrates)
                Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop,
                rewind... It's just like using a tape
                player. Headphones are jacked in.
                Tape's already inside.

                             DEKKER
                Thank you.

60   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                          60

     A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the
     scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.

61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61

     A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we
     rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.
     The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the
     monitors. Conners stands nearby.

                          CONNERS
                    (re: the eighth monitor)
                What's with this one?

                          DAX
                That's the camera in the vault.      It
                blew in the first explosion.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          30.


     The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.

     ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are
     dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up
     to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.

     Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.

     ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK:    Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...
     STATIC FILLS THE SCREENS!

                          DAX
                That's when you cut the power.

                          CONNERS
                So we can't ID them.

                          DAX
                There's a four minute, fifty-two second
                gap, before the image returns. But...

                          CONNERS

                          CONNERS
                    (to Teddy)
                Shit. Feds.

     Jenkins turns to Conners, gestures him over.

                    (beat; stern)
                What does that mean?

                Theory... put to practice isn't always

                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND.     He checks his...

     IN HIS NOTEBOOK--

     Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,
     Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."

     DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.
     He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.

     Dekker presses STOP. Dekker finds a pattern, circles the

64   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         64

     Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,
     40's, and the BANK MANAGER still a bit rattled.

                          AGENT DOYLE
                Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the
                wealthiest and least popular Arabs in
                the Middle East. There's been
                countless threats on his life and
                fortune in the past. But for better of
                worse... he is an ally to the United
                States. The Prince keeps a safe
                deposit box in twenty institutions

                    AGENT DOYLE (cont'd)
          across the country. Along with this
          bank, he also had a box at Eastern
          Federal Savings in Charlotte, North
          Carolina, which was hit last month.
          Same M.O.

                    TEDDY
          What was in the box?

                    BANK MANAGER
          We don't keep records. The boxes are
          private. Since 9/11, we screen for
          live tissue, viruses or explosives, but
          if it passes those tests, we don't ask.

                    CONNERS
          This is all real fascinating shit, but
          what about the money? Bank robbers
          still like cash, don't they?

                    BANK MANAGER
          The cash drawers don't appear touched.
          Neither does the cash vault.

                    TEDDY
          So they broke into a bank and didn't
          steal any money?

Odd glances all about.

                    AGENT DOYLE
          We believe the Prince's box was the
          target. We're trying to reach him now.

                       JENKINS
          Thank you.

Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.

                     JENKINS
          Helluva come back, Conners. Are you
          familiar with the term franchise-sized
          fuck-up...

                    CONNERS
          Depends, are we talking about your sex
          life? Because I've heard shortcomings.

                    JENKINS
          You got played, Quentin.
          Congratulations, you just topped Pearl

                 That's not fair. It was by the book.
                 Everything was according to standard
                 procedure.

      Jenkins ignores Teddy.

                           CONNERS
                 You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

                           JENKINS
                 Commissioner's office is scrambling to
                 cover their ass. They need a
                 scapegoat... And I have zero problems
                 serving you up.

                           CONNERS
                 You wanted this to happen.

                           JENKINS
                 No. But if it had to happen to
                 somebody.

      Jenkins exits.

      Conners approaches...

                           DEKKER
                 I think this Lorenz was trying to tell
                 us something.

                           CONNERS
                 You don't say.

                           DEKKER
                 The way he spoke... he paused before
                 certain words. Have you ever heard of
                 the Chaos Theory?

                            CONNERS
                 What?

      A grade "B" rating, tops.   CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee.

      AT A BOOTH--

      Empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners
      finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all
      about work, goes over his notes.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             34.


                    DEKKER
          Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory
          in the 1960's. It's the study of
          phenomena that appear random, but in
          fact have an element of regularity
          which can be described mathematically.

                    CONNERS
              (confused)
          Try that again?

                    DEKKER
          Pretty much... initial state of events
          may seem unrelated and random, but
          eventually patterns emerge and in the
          end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.

                    WAITRESS
          Anything else, officers?

                    CONNERS
          That'll be all.
              (to Dekker)
          You're a College boy. Which one?
          Someplace I've heard of or one of those
          inbred state schools no one's heard of?

                    DEKKER
          U Dub.

                    CONNERS
          Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.
          How did you end up on the force?

                    DEKKER
          It's kind of the family business.

                    CONNERS
          Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's
          Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.

                    DEKKER
          Do we really need all this "get to know
          you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't
          give a shit.

                    CONNERS
          You've grown on me. Besides, I am
          entrusting my life to you. I should
          know something about you. I would

                    CONNERS (cont'd)
          think you'd like to know a little
          something about me.

                    DEKKER
          I know about you, Detective.      Everyone
          does.

                    CONNERS
          You don't say that with much
          enthusiasm.

                    DEKKER
          Not much to be enthusiastic about.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.

                    CONNERS
          Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
          You, however, have no reputation; a fact I
          need to deal with. After you've been
          through the shit I have, then you can judge
          me. Now... we can try to work together,
          make the best of a bad situation or we can
          compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you.
          But since this is your first day here...
          today... mine's bigger.

                    VINCENT (VO)
              (over radio)
          Conners, come in?

Both men hold steely stares on one another.     Until...

                      CONNERS
                (into radio)
          Go.

                    VINCENT (VO)
          Got something you'll want to see.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.

                    CONNERS
          Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.
          It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Dekker, humbled, scoops up Conners's ten, puts it in his
wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of
the booth.

      Conners ignores her, but Dekker doesn't.   He gives her the
      ONCE OVER. She notices, smiles.

                            VINCENT

      A SHAGGY BROWN HAIRED MAN, 40's, with a MOUSTACHE and an

                Gina, it's the police.    Open up.

     There's no response.   But SOUNDS can be heard on the opposite
     side of the door.

                    (Pounds louder)

     BAM! A GUNSHOT BLOWS APART THE DOOR!     Fired from the inside
     of the apartment!

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The BLASTS KEEP COMING!          Everyone's pinned
     down, on the defensive.

     A WOMAN SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT!

     Dekker gathers himself together.

      A bullet HITS Richards IN THE SHOULDER!     HE YELPS IN PAIN,
      but manages to...

71A   EXT.    FIRE ESCAPE - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT BUILDING            71A

      Richards scrambles out.

71B   INT.    BEDROOM/ LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT            71B

      Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He
      takes one step inside when...

      GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with
      NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS
      FLYING!

      Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her.

                               DEKKER
                  Stay down!

      Vincent enters, grabs Gina.

                            DEKKER
                  Control her!

      He does.    Dekker runs to the bedroom window, peeks out
      over...

76    I/E    FIRE ESCAPE/ LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                  76

      Richards... floors below. Clutches his shoulder in pain, yet
      fearlessly charges downward.

                      (into radio)
                  Suspect fleeing on foot. North on

                  And who are you?

      But he's already gone.

      DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.

      Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street.

      DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage
      and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD,
      WIPES OUT!

      Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT!

77    EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                       77

      Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the
      corner. Targeting DEKKER!

      Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES!

      BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield
      spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.

      The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.

      Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls
      away.

      The truck hits the street, speeds away.

      Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the
      pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.

                            DEKKER
                  I'm a police officer in pursuit of a
                  murder suspect. I need your bike, now!

                            THE BIKER
                      (beat; tosses the keys)
                  It's all yours.

      Dekker picks up the bike, hops on.      Fires up the engine.

78    I/E    HARLEY-RICHARDS'S TRUCK/ CITY STREETS - DAY                   78

      Richards' Truck speeds around a SLOW MOVING VEHICLE and whips
      into an alley.

      The Slow Vehicle skids to a stop! Dekker's hog, cuts inside,
      between the vehicle and the sidewalk, rips into the alley.

78A   I/E    HARLEY-RICHARDS' TRUCK/ ALLEY #1 - DAY                    78A

      Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining
      control. GARBAGE DUMPSTERS are littered about creating an
      obstacle course. Dekker pursues.

78B   I/E   HARLEY-RICHARDS'S FORD TRUCK/ INTERSECTION - DAY        78B

      Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection
      and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY
      DRIVERS let him have it.

      Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage.     Catches
      sight of...

      DOWN THE BLOCK...   A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.

      Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS
      and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!

78C   I/E   PATROL CAR/ HASTINGS STREET - DAY                       78C

      Conners, behind the wheel, speeds towards the scene.

78D   I/E   HARLEY-RICHARDS'S TRUCK/ ALLEY #2 - DAY                 78D

      Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog
      closing in.

      UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

      Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET
      CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

      Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small
      opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

      Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...
      Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into
      the Street Cleaner!

78E   I/E   RICHARDS' TRUCK/ STREET INTERSECTION/ PATROL CAR - DAY 78E

      Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

      Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through
      another intersection, when...

      CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the
      truck, spinning it around.

      Dekker races towards the crash site.

      Conners climbs out of the car.

      Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from
      his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming
      for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see
      Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004            42.


      Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back
      of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel!
      Again!

      Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun.   As Dekker
      arrives...

                           RICHARDS
                 I want... my... lawyer.

      His last words before PASSING OUT.

79    INT.   LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                       79

      A HALF A DOZEN CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS go through the
      place.

79A   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                       79A

      Gina, a cop's jacket around her, is led away in handcuffs.
      Dekker smirks.

79B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                   79B

      A PARAMEDIC, 30's, checks Conners out.    Teddy concludes her
      cellphone conversation.

                           TEDDY
                     (to Conners; re: Richards)
                 He's unconscious, with a nice knot on
                 his forehead, but stable. Three
                 officers are watching the room.

                           CONNERS
                 He wakes, they call.
                     (to the paramedic)
                 Hey Quincy, give it a rest, I'm fine.

                            PARAMEDIC
                     (beat)
                 Quincy was a coroner. You may have a
                 cracked rib. You should go to the
                 hospital.

                           CONNERS
                 I should do a lot of things.

      The Paramedic gives up, exits.   Teddy leans down beside
      Conners.

                           TEDDY
                 You sure you're all right?

                       CONNERS
          I'm fine.

Conners and Teddy share a look, when...   Dekker enters.

                    DEKKER
          Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty-
          eight. Done some time for possession,
          has two kids... Am I interrupting?

                       CONNERS
          No.

                       TEDDY
          Excuse me.

Teddy exits.

                    DEKKER
          Gina claims she doesn't know anything
          about a bank robbery.

                    CONNERS
          Of course she doesn't.   Vincent!

Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.

                    CONNERS
          Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation
          one and turn the A/C on full. Leave
          her alone and cold. Let me know when
          her nipples can cut glass.

                    VINCENT
          Will do.
              (To Dekker)
          Detective... I didn't realize when we
          first met who you were. I worked with
          your father. It was only for a brief
          time when I first got outta the
          academy, but it was an honor.

                    CONNERS
              (surprised)
          Your father was Harry Dekker?

                    VINCENT
          I wish it could've been for longer.

                       DEKKER
          Thanks.

Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light.
Dekker starts away, until...

                   (new subject)
               That was some fancy riding.    You have a
               bike?

                         DEKKER
               Used to, but I sold it.
                   (shows his scrape on his arm)
               They're dangerous.

     MARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her
     head in the room.

                         MARNIE

     TWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed.   Marnie prepares a
     report.

                         CONNERS
               Somebody going on a trip?

                         MARNIE
               Looks like it, don't it?

                         CONNERS
               Marnie, you're looking well.

                         MARNIE
               Heard you were back, Conners... and
               keep dreaming.

     Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.

                          MARNIE
                    (to Dekker)
               You, on the other hand... I gotta bike
               myself. Maybe we can go for a ride
               sometime? Or maybe I can just ride
               you.

     Conners looks at both of them.

                         CONNERS
               Can we get back to work?

                         MARNIE
               We got passports, sun tan lotion,
               Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully
               hers and this...

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside
the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.

                    DEKKER
          Must be a fifty large there easy.    His
          cut?

                    MARNIE
          You'd think, right?

                      DEKKER
          It's not?

                    MARNIE
          Don't put words in my mouth, but...
          Two things jump out here. First, each
          bank branch has their own money bands.
          This is not American National's. After
          a little checking, it belongs to
          Pacific Savings of Seattle.

                    DEKKER
          That sounds familiar.

                    MARNIE
          It should. Four months ago, a half
          million dollars was stolen in an armed
          robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
          job. They caught the guys a day later,
          recovering about $400,000. Those guys
          have been in lock up since and their
          trial's still pending. Which leads us
          to point number two. Do you smell
          that?

                    DEKKER
              (smells the bills; grimaces)
          What is it?

                    MARNIE
          When evidence is taken in, any physical
          contact might affect the ability to
          lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
          spray a scented solution directly on
          the bill.

                    CONNERS
          Is that new?

                    MARNIE
          Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with
          the times, Conners.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004       46.


                           DEKKER
                 So this money's not from our bank.

                           MARNIE
                 No. This is the money from the Pacific
                 Savings job and our evidence room.
                     (smiling; to Dekker)
                 Now... For a list of things you can
                 put in my mouth.

                 Do you remember who headed up the
                 Pacific Savings case?

                           TEDDY
                 I think it was Callo.    Why?

                 No reason.     Just thinking out loud.

     Conners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's
     quiet between these two, until...

                           CONNERS
                 When you said it was your "family
                 business" I didn't think... I guess I
                 just didn't connect the dots.

                           DEKKER
                 Don't worry about it.

                           CONNERS
                 Your father was a hero.

                           DEKKER
                 Yes he was.

                           CONNERS
                 At first I thought maybe you were
                 related to the Captain.

                            DEKKER
                 No.   No relation.

                           CONNERS
                 The Captain, he just kind of
                 "discovered" you. Through the academy,

                That's how he found me.

     This surprises Dekker.

83   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT         83

     A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

     Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so
     are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT.
     Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in
     the corner, observing.

                We found the money.

                That money was Dwayne's...

                          CONNERS

                I told you. I don't know nothing about

                into, I didn't know!

                          CONNERS
                So, where were you going?

                            GINA
                Vacation.

                This isn't possession or solicitation,
                Gina. This is felony-murder one. You
                could get life.

                           GINA
                Me!?   I didn't do nothing!

                    CONNERS
              (frustrated)
          It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
          do nothing" is a double negative,
          infers the positive. The grammar in
          this country sucks.

                    GINA
          Then I didn't do ANY-thing!

Conners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through
her.

                    CONNERS
          This isn't going away. You want to
          walk out of here, you tell me
          something... now.

                    GINA
          I swear I don't know. Now I'm done
          talking. I want a lawyer.

Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed.

                    CONNERS
          You sure that's what you want?

                    GINA
          Yeah.

                    CONNERS
          Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
          make. The first will be to the public
          defender's office. The second to
          children's services.

                    GINA
          What?

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and
lonely girl.

                    CONNERS
          It's simple... if you insist on a
          lawyer, I take your kids.

                    GINA
          No.

                    CONNERS
          Not like you cared about them anyway.
          You were ready to fly the coop with
          "Shit-for-brains."

                           GINA
                No.   You can't do that.

                          CONNERS
                I can and I will.

                           GINA
                Don't.

                          CONNERS
                Tell me what I want to know!

     Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.

                          GINA
                    (broken)
                I don't know anything.     Please don't
                take my kids. Please.

     Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth.
     Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.

                          CONNERS
                Get her some coffee...     Something hot.

     Dekker and Conners...

                          DEKKER
                You believe her?

                          CONNERS
                I think for the first time in that
                girl's life she's telling the truth.

                          DEKKER
                You had to know, once she asked for a
                lawyer anything she told us would have
                been inadmissable.

                          CONNERS
                Who would've known? It would've been
                my word against hers. Who do you think
                the jury would've believed?

                          DEKKER
                Justice by any means.    Even if you
                cross the line.

                          CONNERS
                The only line around here is the `blue

                problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm

     Teddy enters, hands Conners a sheet of paper with: "EVIDENCE:
     ITEM #4958378" scribbled on it.

                          TEDDY
                Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me...
                According to our computers, that money
                should be downstairs.

85   INT.   EVIDENCE ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                85

     Occupies almost the entire basement of the police station.      A
     STEEL CAGE protects the contents.

     AT THE FRONT COUNTER--

     Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present.
     Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone.

     Dekker RINGS the service bell.

     Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the
     desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen
     better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.

                           CONNERS
                    (cold)
                Buzz us in.

                          HARRY
                    (colder)
                You gotta sign first.

     Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.

                          HARRY
                I heard you were back. Kinda liked not
                having you around, Conners.

     Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then
     reluctantly BUZZES them in.

                          CONNERS
                Have another donut, Frankie.

     Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST
     ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number.

                That fat fuck is the sole guardian of

                All totalled, about $50 million or so
                just sitting here for the taking.

      Finally, finding the right row, they turn in.

                          DEKKER
                You'd have to have some major
                firepower, not to mention an extra
                large set of balls to try and knock off
                a police station.

                          CONNERS
                Not if you were a cop.    You could just
                walk right in and...

      AN EMPTY SPACE, marked in tape, "ITEM #4958378."

      Dekker and Conners surround Harry as he digs through his file
      box. After a few moments, grabs a clipboard.

                          HARRY
                Here is it. Line seventeen.

                          DEKKER

                          HARRY
                Like I said... No one takes anything
                out of here, unless they sign for it.

                             CONNERS
                So what...     He showed you a warrant?
                What?

                          HARRY
                He must've.

                          CONNERS
                You don't remember?

                You know how many times someone signs
                shit in and out? I see the same guys
                all the time. I can't remember one
                instance two weeks ago. But if his
                signature's there, that means he signed
                for it. Take it up with him!

     Jenkins listens as Conners and crew brief the situation.

                The money from Richards's place traced
                back to the Pacific Savings heist a few
                months ago, a case Callo headed up.

                          TEDDY
                Callo signed the money out of evidence
                two weeks ago.

                            JENKINS
                How much?

                            TEDDY
                $433,000.

                          VINCENT
                If it's Callo, it would explain how
                they knew police protocol and how our
                department operates.

                          TEDDY
                Also explains why he was so pissed this
                morning about being replaced by
                Conners. He wanted to be the point so
                everything went according to plan.

                          CONNERS
                He doesn't need another reason to be
                pissed at me.

                          JENKINS
                What about motive?    Do we have one?

                          VINCENT
                Pressure might've been getting to him.
                He's been getting the cold shoulder
                from cops since he testified about
                Pearl Street Bridge.

                           JENKINS
                No.   Don't buy that.

                           TEDDY
                    (beat)

                About a month ago, he told me he and
                his wife might be splitting. Asked if
                I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him
                out. I didn't think it was this bad.

                    (conflicted)
                Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A

                They never do, Captain.

                Don't act like you're not enjoying
                this, Conners. I know what you think
                of him.

                          CONNERS
                Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts
                here speak for themselves.

                          DEKKER
                No they don't. We haven't asked the
                question... Why, if Callo's involved,
                don't they ask for him at the bank?
                    (points to Conners)
                They asked for you.

     SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through
     every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and
     Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...

                          OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE
                Wife came home approximately forty-five
                minutes ago. Found him here. None of
                the neighbors heard anything. There's
                no forced entry and no one saw anyone
                fleeing the scene.

     Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.

                          VINCENT
                Blueprints from the bank, schematics,

                internet articles on the Saudi Prince.
                Found it behind the furnace.

     Conners nods.

                          DEKKER
                Well, that's it, right?

     Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers
     around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS
     UP...

                You've reached the Callo residence.   No

                Are you connecting the dots? Are you

     Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...

                          CONNERS
                What they told Callo was the plan and what
                the plan really was may be two different
                things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan
                Callo would've agreed with.

                          DEKKER
                You'd think a cop would be smarter.

                          CONNERS
                As cops we come across every temptation
                in the book. Money, drugs, power.
                We'd all like to think we can resist
                any urge, but... We're not saints.

                          DEKKER
                So, Callo was involved and now they're
                dragging you into it. Why?

                          CONNERS
                Man said he wanted vengeance.

                           CONNERS
                Me?

     Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up.

                          JENKINS
                I just got off the phone with Agent
                Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,
                the Prince withdrew all his possessions
                from every safe deposit box in this
                country.

                            DEKKER
                  Let me get this straight, they didn't
                  touch the cash or the safe deposit
                  boxes. So, they... break into a bank,
                  blow it up, and steal nothing?
                      (to Conners)
                  Still make sense to you?

                            CONNERS
                  Nothing about today makes sense.

       Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the
       Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police
       car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

       Dekker's mind works overtime, then...

                             DEKKER
                  "Return to the earth now if your mind
                  is troubled and your heart is
                  uncertain. For it is by returning to
                  the beginning that we can clearly see
                  the path."

       Conners and Jenkins share a confused look.

                  We go back to where this all started.

                  The tapes confirm five bad guys, but
                  since the vault cam blew in the
                  explosion what they did in there was a
                  mystery.

ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES
appear.

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz
leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group
splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives
and radios in.

                    DAX

          Notice the camera angles, they're all

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...

                    DEKKER
          There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,
          camera five, the vault cam, dominates
          our attention because of the explosion.
          But while that's happening, check out
          Camera two, customer service.

ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.
Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE
SECURITY CAMERA.

                He moved it. Changed the angle.    He
                didn't want us to see something.

                What's in that corner they didn't want
                us to see?

     Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and
     FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.

93   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                 93

     AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,
     carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.

     Dekker and Conners look on.

                          DEKKER
                Are you at all concerned that there's
                some whacko out there looking to get

     The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS

     The ITALIAN RESTAURANT HOST, 50's, jolly with a thick accent,
     greets Conners and Dekker.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                Detective, where you been? Much too
                long. Sit, sit. I give you best table
                in house. It'll just be the two?

                            CONNERS
                No, four.    More are coming.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                Wonderful, wonderful. Who's this young
                man?

                          CONNERS
                For all intents and purposes... he's
                Big Brother.

                    (confused)
                He's your brother?

                            CONNERS
                No.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                No matter, no matter...     I bring you
                bottle of house wine!

                          DEKKER
                We're still on duty.     No wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                    (insulted)
                No wine?

                          CONNERS
                A little wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                That's better.

     They get to the table, Conners looks at it.

                          CONNERS
                Last time I was here, you said that
                table in the corner was the "best in
                the house."

               It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best

               food.

95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95

     A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS
     sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.

     AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--

     Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
     OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
     consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
     mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.

     Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
     have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
     Detectives, admires in their closeness.

                         CONNERS
               Shane, what was that thing you said
               back at the house about "returning to
               the beginning path" or something?

                         DEKKER
               It's a Buddhist story.

                         CONNERS
               We're all ears.

                         DEKKER
               One day the Buddha found his heart in
               turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
               to the earth, to the base of a great
               tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
               elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
               doesn't like seeing him discouraged.

                         TEDDY
               He can talk to an elephant?

                         DEKKER
               He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
               level of consciousness. He's capable
               of communicating with plants, trees...
               even rocks.

          The Buddha was troubled so he went back
          to where he came from, the beginning,
          to find the path, the answer. So when

          something like that.

          You're a Buddhist?

                   DEKKER
          No. Just something I picked up along
          the way.

          But you're religious?

                    DEKKER

Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses
himself to go to the men's room.

                    DEKKER
          You're all pretty tight.

                    TEDDY
          We've been through a lot together.

                    DEKKER
          I guess I just thought... I don't
          know. With all the trouble he's been
          in lately, coming back from suspension,
          everyone would treat him differently.

                    VINCENT
          You can't believe what you read or see
          on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners
          is stronger. He's one of the best.
          Even when things got pretty wild today
          and everyone else panicked, he was in
          control. That doesn't just happen.
          He's just that good.

     LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.

     Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word
     can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE

     embrace.

                          CONNERS

     Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the

     Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.

                 Break, no.     Bend... if it means
                 justice...     Absolutely.

98    EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    98

      Off the main road, sits a DARK, TWO-STORY HOME on a HILLSIDE.

99    INT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    99

      The design is MODERN, FLAWLESS and COLD. Every room is
      equipped with VIDEO CAMERAS and MONITORS.

      ON THE MONITOR... The screen is divided into 16 small boxes
      showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house. Our
      concentration settles on BOX #7...

100   INT.   BEDROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         100

      CHRIS LEI, live and in the flesh, quickly stuffs belongings
      into a suitcase. He's nervous, tense. From the top drawer
      of his dresser, he grabs an armful of underwear, socks, dumps
      them into the suitcase.

      What Chris doesn't see...

      IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSER...   LORENZ!

101   EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   101

      Conners pulls the car to the curb.    He and Dekker hop out.

102   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                   102

      From his second floor window, Chris sees Conners and Dekker.

                              CHRIS
                 Shit.

      Chris turns, FINDS HIMSELF STARING DOWN A BARREL!

                           LORENZ
                 Fare thee well, Chris.

      Chris swallows, Lorenz pulls the trigger and...

103   EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   103

      BAM! THE GUNSHOT ECHOES OUTSIDE. Conners and Dekker draw
      their weapons, quickly descend on the house!

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004           65.


104   INT.   FRONT HALL - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                     104

      THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously
      enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No
      indications that these two just met today.

      The House is almost PITCH BLACK.

      Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to
      take the back of the house.

105   INT.   KITCHEN - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                        105

      Dekker proceeds inside.   After a scan, the kitchen's clean.

106   INT.   UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT               106

      Conners emerges from the stairway.

107   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    107

      Dekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living
      room. Eyes straight ahead and sharp. What he doesn't see...

      LORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS.

108   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  108

      Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he
      finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he
      notices...

      ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND
      Dekker!

109   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    109

      Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads
      for the front hallway.

      Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker.

      Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the
      living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP!

      A BULLET GRAZES DEKKER'S SHOULDER!    THE REST LITTER THE
      WALLS, BLOW APART A MIRROR!

      Conners and Dekker, behind the wall, regroup. Conners
      RETALIATES. FIRES FOUR ROUNDS AT LORENZ, but...

       Lorenz bursts through the back door, down the stairs!

113    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE                           113

       Conners and Dekker...

                              CONNERS
                  You okay?

                              DEKKER
                  Yeah.

114    EXT.   BACKYARD - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                      114

       Dekker and Conners emerge from the house...     LORENZ, on the
       other end of the yard, OPENS FIRE!

       The Detectives DIVE FOR COVER!

       Lorenz exits through the fence's door...

114A   INT.   ALLEY BEHIND CHRIS LEI'S HOUSE - NIGHT               114A

       ... and climbs into a BLACK MERCEDES-BENZ, quickly peels
       away!

114B   EXT.   BACKYARD - CHRIS'S HOUSE                             114B

       Dekker and Conners bounce up, run out the back fence, but...

114C   EXT.   ALLEY BEHIND CHRIS LEI'S HOUSE - NIGHT               114C

       As they get there... LORENZ'S MERCEDES, turns out of the
       alley and disappears into the night.

       Dekker stares out, deflated.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004            67.


      An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's
      injured shoulder. Dekker grimaces from the pain. Conners
      approaches...

                           CONNERS
                 First day in the city and you've
                 already been shot.

                           EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECH
                 It just grazed him.

                           DEKKER
                 Why don't I "just graze" you with a
                 bullet and see how you feel.

                           POLICE OFFICER #3
                 Your Damon Richards is awake.

119   EXT.   HOSPITAL - NIGHT                                        119

      To establish.

120   INT.   TRAUMA ROOM - HOSPITAL                                  120

      HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to
      an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes
      rhythmically.

      Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.

                           CONNERS
                     (to the officers)
                 Take five, guys.

      The officers exit. Conners LOCKS the door, walks to the bed,
      leans over Richards.

                           CONNERS
                 Hiya, Damon. How you feeling?

                           DEKKER
                     (taps Conners)
                 May I?

      Conners concedes the floor.     Dekker addresses Richards.

                           DEKKER
                 You remember me, don't you?
                     (Damon gives an EVIL GLARE)
                 Thought so.

      Dekker turns his attention to Richards' IV, the tubes which
      carry medication into his body.

       From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.

                            DEKKER
                  I was skiing about three years ago.
                  Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?
                  Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a
                  sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.
                  Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like
                  you did today. I was in a hospital bed
                  for three months. Had it not been
                  for... Here it is.
                      (he finds)
                  Morphine. Without this stuff, I
                  wouldn't have made it.

       Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

                            DEKKER
                  Now this IV drip administers a small
                  dosage every minute. Makes you feel
                  relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

       Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.

                            DEKKER
                  If I were to inject this whole thing...
                  That would be all she wrote for Damon.

                            RICHARDS
                  You don't have the balls.

       Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
       to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.

                            DEKKER
                  This equipment malfunctions all the
                  time. Overdoses are quite common.
                  Besides, I don't think the DA's going
                  to launch a full-scale investigation
                  over a scum like you.

       Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the
       call button away.

                            DEKKER
                  You don't have to tell us a damn thing.
                  Plead the fifth... roll the dice.

       Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,
       signals that he'll talk.

120A   EXT.   HOSPITAL - NIGHT                                    120A

       Conners and Dekker exit, head to their car...

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004         69.


                            CONNERS
                  You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me
                  shit for my interrogating skills...
                  least I don't threaten them with a
                  lethal overdose.

       Dekker holds the empty vile up, hands it to Conners.

                            DEKKER
                  There's never been a single case in
                  recorded medical history of someone
                  overdosing on 200 milliliters of
                  saline.

       Conners checks the label, smiles.

                            DEKKER
                  Bend, not break. That's what you said,
                  right?

A121   EXT.   SEATTLE SUBURB - NIGHT                            A121

       Lorenz, AKA SCOTT CURTIS, enters his car.

                            JENKINS (VO)
                  Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.
                  He's wanted in connection to three
                  other bank robberies, extorsion and
                  kidnapping.

121    INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT        121

       Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two
       new Detectives - DET. TOMMY BRANCH, 40's and DET. JEROME
       KNIGHT, 50's.

                             JENKINS
                  He's also the brother of John Curtis,
                  the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street
                  Bridge.
                      (Moving on)
                  Richards testifies that he was hired by
                  Curtis to pull the bank job with a
                  dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.
                  Curtis hoped that Conners would take
                  the fall for American National turning
                  ugly, disgracing him even further. We
                  also have the names of two more
                  accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander
                  Harrington. Everyone was set to meet
                  tonight at ten and we have that
                  address.
                      (beat)
                  After finding Callo and Lei dead today,

                            JENKINS (cont'd)
                  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
                  know Curtis is eliminating his
                  accomplices. Doesn't matter what
                  Curtis told Galt and Harrington, he's
                  going to finish them off tonight.

122   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - NIGHT - TRAVELLING          122

      Conners drives, Dekker shotgun.      Conners more intense than
      normal.

                             CONNERS
                  You never think of the repercussions.
                  The suspect's mother, father...
                  Brother. How your decision affects

                  He had murder in his eyes.

                  It was pouring. Lights everywhere.       If
                  he had only done what I said.

                  My father died when I was twelve. He
                  walked into a liquor store in the
                  middle of a stick up. Guy just opened
                  fire. Never even had time to react.

                   that means to a twelve year old?
                       (beat)
                   Because he died on the job, he's a
                   hero? Never made sense to me.

                   bridge. If you weren't there, the girl
                   still would've died. She had a chance
                   because you were there. That's all we
                   can do.

        A two story house sits on a quiet corner in a quaint
        neighborhood. CRICKETS CHIRP, break the silence of the
        night. Two CARS sit in a gravel driveway.

        Through the open windows... Two men, LAMAR GALT, 40's, and

       Harrington's the first to hear it.     In the dead silence,
       everyone soon does.

       Just as Teddy's able to silence it... Harrington SPOTS her
       car, doesn't think twice, just starts FIRING!

       Dekker stands outside the closet. He opens it quickly, but
       it's empty. Except for... On the far wall -- HUNDREDS OF
       PICTURES of Conners. The same shrine we saw Lorenz in front
       of earlier.

       Vincent swings in from one entrance, Teddy the other.   She
       takes a cautious step out, when...

       BAM! A BULLET ZINGS PAST TEDDY - HITS THE WALL BESIDE HER
       HEAD!

       HARRINGTON, from the corner, takes aim again!

       VINCENT drops to the floor, aims through the dining room
       table legs and FIRES!

                           TEDDY
                 Drop the gun!

       Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he
       aiming or surrendering?

                           TEDDY
                 Drop it now. Last warning.

       But he doesn't.

                              CONNERS
                 Teddy!?     What's happening?

       Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs.

       something catches Conners's eye.

       BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS
       WEAPON!

       Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
       time!

       DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!    Vincent breaks his fall.

       GALT FIRES AT CONNERS, until he's out of bullets.      He ducks
       back behind a door.

       Conners FIRES!   But did he hit anyone?     Conners pursues...

138A   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS--                                   138A

       flies from his hands.

      Teddy's EYES fall to...

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE.         It
      runs from the wall into the vent.

      She follows it into THE KITCHEN.

      back! He then SLAMS Galt against the wall, Galt KNEES
      Conners in the gut.

                              DEKKER
                  We can't.

                            TEDDY
                  We have to.

150   EXT.   HOUSE - 11:10 PM - NIGHT                                150

      FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the
      house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene.
      FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames.

      Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.

      A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY
      BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still
      visible. They load him into the truck.

      TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A
      Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.

      JENKINS huddles with a group of Detectives.

                            JENKINS
                 ...   If it had to be someone...

      Teddy and Dekker overhear this.

                     (To Jenkins)
                 You sonofabitch.

                 Teddy...

                           TEDDY
                 You've always been jealous of him.

                              JENKINS
                 Jealous?

                           TEDDY
                 It's because he wasn't only a better
                 cop... He was a better man.

                              JENKINS
                 Detective.     Go home.

      Teddy really wants to explode, but doesn't. She walks away.
      Jenkins digests what she said, then his eyes find Dekker...

                 No, Captain. She said it perfectly.

                 Detective Galloway, could you give us a
                 comment?

      Teddy looks STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA, but can't say a thing.
      That's when DEKKER grabs the camera, PUSHES it out of her
      face.

                           KAREN CROSS
                 We just wanted a statement.

                 Shame on you.

                 Conners was right. We should've never
                 gone in. How many more mistakes can we
                 make in one day? He was eliminating
                 his accomplices. We thought he was
                 going to show up? We didn't even think
                 he could do this... How dumb are we?

151   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                      151

      Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk
      lamp...

      Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on
      the man, his career. He shuts off the lamp, heads for the
      door.

                              DAX
                 Detective?

      Dekker turns to find...       Dax, cradling a 3,000 PAGE DOCUMENT.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004   81.


                    DAX
          I know what they were doing inside the
          bank.

DEKKER AND DAX--

Dax flips through the huge document.

                    DAX
          These are today's transaction records
          from the bank. An average day produces
          about 400 pages, give or take. Today,
          there were over 3,000 pages.

                     DEKKER
          Meaning?

                    DAX
          We've just witnessed the largest heist
          in history. Somewhere in the
          neighborhood of a billion dollars.

                    DEKKER
          Come again?

                    DAX
          It's a computer virus. "The Computer
          Virus." It randomly withdraws money
          from all the accounts and deposits it
          into the bad guys' account. If you
          check the transactions, no two
          withdrawal amounts are the same and
          none of'em are over $100. Most
          security systems work on the size of
          the money, not number of transactions.
          Wire out one million from a handful of
          accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
          a less than a hundred from ten million
          accounts, no flags.

                    DEKKER
          Where's the money now?

                    DAX
          I tried following one of the
          transactions. It took me an hour and
          when I finally had it... It went away.

                    DEKKER
          How is that possible?

                    DAX
          The virus created a host of phantom
          accounts where the money goes

                 temporarily, then transfers to another
                 account, then to another. It's never
                 in one place long enough to get an
                 accurate fix.

                           DEKKER
                 It's still moving the money around?

                           DAX
                 Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
                 any bank doesn't usually go into affect
                 until the next business day. So it's
                 going to keep jumping around until it
                 clears at 9 AM tomorrow.

                           DEKKER
                     (realizes)
                 Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why
                 break in? If they're just wiring
                 money? Couldn't they do that from
                 anywhere?

                           DAX
                 That's the regional manager's computer
                 terminal. There's no outside/remote
                 access to it. There you have unlimited
                 entry to the bank's mainframe. No
                 passwords to work around, no "hacking"
                 in. It's all nice and clean.

                           DEKKER
                 A billion dollars is missing and we're
                 only discovering this now?

                           DAX
                 Ironically, when the power went out, it
                 helped hide the virus and bought it
                 time to work.

                           DEKKER
                 So they weren't trying to make   it look
                 like they were robbing a bank,   to rip
                 off a Saudi Prince? They were    making
                 it look like they ripped off a   Saudi
                 Prince to rob a bank.

      Dekker shuffles to his car, his cellphone rings.
      Answering...

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004           83.

                 Detective Dekker, there's a call for
                 you. Says it's urgent.

                           DEKKER
                 Put it through.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 Good evening Detective. I just wanted
                 to compliment you on a fine day. You
                 were an unexpected adversary that was
                 most challenging.

                           DEKKER
                 It's not over yet.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 Wishful thinking.

                           DEKKER
                 No. My wish is to catch you. You're a
                 murderer. A cop killer at that.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
                 it. Callo was insignificant and
                 Conners crossed me. In years to come
                 you'll thank me for getting rid of him
                 before he corrupted you.

                           DEKKER
                 I know about the money. You steal a
                 billion dollars... They will find you.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 A risk I'm willing to take. It's
                 almost sunrise. Fare thee well.

      Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the
      phone, heads back inside the station.

153   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT          153

      Dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork.   Not
      sure what to look for, he goes through everything.

      His notes from the bank. The file on Galt, Harrington, Chris
      Lei. He even digs through Conners and finally... Callo's
      file.

      Jenkins heads for the exit.

                     (in complete work mode)
                 Callo's insignificant.

                 What?

                           DEKKER
                 That's what he said, Callo's
                 insignificant. But he wasn't.

                           JENKINS
                 What are you talking about?

                             DEKKER
                 Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me.

                           JENKINS
                 He called you?

                           DEKKER
                 He said he didn't kill anyone who
                 didn't deserve it. He said Callo was
                 insignificant. But without Callo he
                 wouldn't have had the knowledge of our
                 department and...
                     (grabs a clipboard)
                 ... He wouldn't have had the front
                 money to hire the crew.

                           JENKINS
                 He was screwing with your head. Go
                 home, Shane. You did good today. Your
                 Dad would be proud. Get some sleep.
                 There will be more bad guys tomorrow.

      Jenkins exits.

      Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers...
      Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The
      signatures.

      Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks
      inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two
      DIFFERENT FILES available to him.

                           HARRY
                 I was in bed already.     This couldn't
                 wait til morning.

                     DEKKER
              (cold)
          How did he come at you, Harry? It's
          the only thing that doesn't make sense.

                    HARRY
          What are you talking about?

                    DEKKER
          All day long we thought Callo was the
          dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.

Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry.

                     DEKKER
          That's the sign-out sheet from the
          evidence room. Here's one of Callo's
          reports. Here's another one... and
          another --

The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine
them. He knows.

                    DEKKER
          They're not the same signature, Harry.
          They're not even close.

                    HARRY
              (shrugs it off)
          Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I
          don't know.

                    DEKKER
              (re: file #1)
          This is your file... You were
          reprimanded, a month ago after you
          confronted Callo at the courthouse.
          You punched him. That ring a bell?

                    HARRY
          And I'd do it again. Cops who testify
          against cops shouldn't be breathing the
          same air I do. There's a line you
          don't cross!

                    DEKKER
          So you set him up! You forged Callo's
          signature, you gave him the money and
          you helped him with his plan because
          you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl
          Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry
          cause I know.

      John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S
      SHOULDER... CONNERS APPROACHES, GUN DRAWN!

      Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face.

      A FLASH OF LIGHT ENVELOPS CONNERS!

      CLOSE ON... A GUN FIRES!

      John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.

      Harry pounds the table...

                 You're helping a cop killer, Harry.
                 You're a year from pension. This is
                 how you want to go out?

                           HARRY
                 My conscience is clean.

                           DEKKER
                 This has been a very long, trying day.
                 And I'm tired. We're chasing a

                 phantom. Just when we have him... he
                 disappears. He's been two steps ahead
                 of Conners and me all day.

                           HARRY
                 Of course he has.   Who knows Conners
                 better than him?

                           DEKKER
                     (what?)
                 How the hell does Curtis know Conners
                 better than anyone?

      Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the
      bag.

                           DEKKER
                     (realizes)
                 We're not talking about Curtis, are we,
                 Harry?
                     (still no response)
                 Who would know Conners better than
                 anyone? Who would you protect? And
                 who in your mind got the raw deal at

      IN REVERSE MOTION - JOHN CURTIS GETS UP... THE BULLET RE-
      ENTERS CONNERS'S GUN... LISA REANN SCREAMS!

      REVEAL THE ENTIRE SCENE: LORENZ/ CURTIS STANDS NEXT TO
      CONNERS ON THE BRIDGE HOLDING A GUN.

      LORENZ/CURTIS IS YORK!

      NOW RESUME ACTION... Conners and York aim their guns at...
      John holds Lisa tight.

                           CONNERS
                 Drop the weapon. Let the girl go.

      John PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple.

                           YORK
                 That, you don't want to do.

      York narrows his aim on John Curtis.

                           JOHN CURTIS
                 One step closer and the girl dies.

                 Think about this... you kill her,
                 where are you going to...

      SIMULTANEOUSLY... YORK FIRES just as Lisa STRUGGLES, MOVES!
      The Bullet intended for John Curtis, HITS Lisa, kills her
      instantly.

      Lisa's body crumples to the ground.

      Conners and York look on in horror, knowing York's bullet
      felled an innocent.

      John turns to fire on the detectives...      Conners fires -
      KILLS John Curtis!

      John's body hits pavement.      RAIN POURS DOWN!

      Dekker puts it together...

                           DEKKER
                 It was York who was the bad cop. He
                 assumed Scott Curtis's identity to
                 throw us off the trail.

                 York plays his old partner, knowing all
                 his moves, frames his enemy for the
                 crime, kills him too and pulls off the
                 biggest robbery in history.

                           HARRY
                 Do what you want to me. He called to
                 tell me he was going and he's gone and
                 you ain't never going to find him.

                      (beat; thinks)
                  No. If there's a signal. Means he's
                  still here. He's waiting for something
                  or someone.

      Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and...

          Easy for you to say. I'm a plane ride
          away from a King's Ransom.

THROUGH A SIDE DOOR... Teddy slides in, unnoticed.

                    DEKKER
          Drop the weapon, let the girl go.

                     YORK
          And spend the rest of my days in a

                     YORK
              (realizes)
          That's exactly what I said to him. Do
          you see the irony here? Am I the only
          one? Two months ago I was in your

Teddy moves into position from the side!    Then...

The BUS BOY enters from the same door Teddy came in.     The
door BANGS closed behind him.

York spins, FIRES in that direction!

Teddy's HIT!   The Bus Boy retreats out the side door!

YORK TURNS ON DEKKER, FIRES!

Dekker DUCKS away safely.

York drags the Pretty Waitress to the back!

Dekker runs over, checks on Teddy.

      HUNDREDS OF GIANT STEEL CARGO CONTAINERS litter the yard...
      makes the place look and feel like a GIANT MAZE.

      York disappears into the steel maze.

      Dekker enters, slows to a walk. Carefully proceeds forward.
      Gun drawn. Second guessing each turn.

      Dekker rounds a corner...

                  Your conviction would be admirable, if
                  it wasn't just so sad.

      At the far end of the container, York FIRES!

      Dekker ducks back.

      York takes a look out, doesn't see Dekker.

                 coming to save the day. The bad guy
                 gets away at the end of this story.

      Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.

                           YORK (OS)
                 But I'll give you credit... You turned
                 out to be quite the little thorn,
                 didn't you?

      Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.

                           YORK (OS)
                 I think Conners would be sorry that you
                 died. But not me.

      Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look
      alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.
      Until...

      BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He
      dive-rolls for cover as...

      ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out
      of ammo.

      Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

      York leaps off the backside of the container!

      Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York.
      Instead, he finds a DOCK.

174   EXT.   DOCK - NIGHT                                             174

      A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT
      and at the end... A SEAPLANE.

      Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate.
      EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

      As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM.
      From on top of the TUG BOAT!

      Dekker turns just as...

      York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker
      struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

      York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker
      over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!

      Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.

      York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab,
      when...

      At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE
      BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
      beneath the water.

      Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He
      falls to the planks.

      York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he
      wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

      Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder.

                           YORK
                 I have come this far...      I will not be
                 denied.

      Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
      York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

      Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

      York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

      Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

      York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
      He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

      ... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his
      chest... POPS out his back!

      York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.
      Then go dead.

      Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at
      York's body.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

                    TEDDY
          We used to spend all day   Sunday just
          reading in bed. I would    read the paper
          and he would read one of   his billion
          books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew
          that. But I still loved    him.

Teddy stares out the window...

POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.

                     TEDDY
          He's the only man I ever loved.

          Did we all get shot today?

They can't help but laugh.

                    DEKKER
          They said in the city I'd be busy.
          Every day like this?

                    TEDDY
          Pretty much.

                      DEKKER
          Great.    I wonder what's next?

                      TEDDY
          For me...    a long vacation.

Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay
the check.

AT THE CASHIER...   Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.

                      DEKKER
          How much?

                    PRETTY WAITRESS
          Do you think I'm going to charge you
          after all that? Go on.

                      DEKKER
          Thanks.

Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN
DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...

That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR
comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN
DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?

                 When evidence is taken in, any physical
                 mark might effect the ability to lift
                 prints, so, to mark it, we spray it

181    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                     181

       PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.

       Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
       rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

       That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
       and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.

       Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-
       lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS
       THEORY, BIRTH OF A NEW SCIENCE."

                                                                 TIME CUT TO:

                      (into phone)
                  You tried them all?/ Nothing for

                  maybe he's not on a flight.

       Dekker then notices - the book.     The author's name.

                               DEKKER
                  Try again.     But try Gleick.   James

                 Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault.

                 This is Callo's fault?

                 If it weren't for him, York and I
                 would've never done this. One random
                 act, causes another, causes another,
                 and in the end... the pattern emerges.

         Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose.

         They should've suspended me after I
         testified. What did they expect?

                   DEKKER
         And because the "bitch that made her
         career off you" worked for Channel Two,
         that's why American National was the
         target.

         Why not kill me? You had plenty of
         opportunities.

                   CONNERS
         This wasn't about killing, Shane. This
         was about standing up for what matters.
         Besides... you kinda grew on me.

         This is a very valuable lesson for you

                 this would've happened. The system

               FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and 
               woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING 
               in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, 
               MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.

                                     CURLY'S VOICE
                              (crying out)
                         Oh, no.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE

               CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over 
               GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his 
               breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' 
               shiny desk top.

               Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at 
               it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite 
               the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a 
               cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk.

               Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist 
               into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts 
               to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left 
               a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos 
               of several movie stars askew.

               Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He 
               is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually 
               bites into the blinds.

               Gittes doesn't move from his chair.

                                     GITTES
                         All right, enough is enough. You 
                         can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. 
                         I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.

               Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes 
               reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly 
               selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of 
               more expensive whiskeys.

               Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his 
               desk toward Curly.

                                     GITTES
                         Down the hatch.

               Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. 
               He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry 
               quietly.

                                     CURLY
                              (drinking, relaxing a 
                              little)
                         She's just no good.

                                     GITTES
                         What can I tell you, Kid? You're 
                         right. When you're right, you're 
                         right, and you're right.

                                     CURLY
                         Ain't worth thinking about.

               Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.

                                     GITTES
                         You're absolutely right, I wouldn't 
                         give her another thought.

                                     CURLY
                              (pouring himself)
                         You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I 
                         know it's your job, but you're okay.

                                     GITTES
                              (settling back, 
                              breathing a little 
                              easier)
                         Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.

                                     CURLY
                         Thanks. You know something, Jake?

                                     GITTES
                         What's that, Curly?

                                     CURLY
                         I think I'll kill her.

               INT. DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE

               Noticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed, dark-
               haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling 
               with the veil on her pillbox hat.

                                     WOMAN
                         I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to 
                         this personally.

                                     WALSH
                              (almost the manner of 
                              someone comforting 
                              the bereaved)
                         If you'll allow us to complete our 
                         preliminary questioning, by then 
                         he'll be free.

               There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office.

               Something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE  GITTES & CURLY

               Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring 
               contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over 
               him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of 
               perspiration on his desk.

                                     CURLY
                              (crying)
                         They don't kill a guy for that.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh they don't?

                                     CURLY
                         Not for your wife. That's the 
                         unwritten law.

               Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;

                                     GITTES
                         I'll tell you the unwritten law, you 
                         dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be 
                         rich to kill somebody, anybody and 
                         get away with it. You think you got 
                         that kind of dough, you think you 
                         got that kind of class?

               Curly shrinks back a little.

                                     CURLY
                         ...No...

                                     GITTES
                         You bet your ass you don't. You can't 
                         even pay me off.

               This seems to upset Curly even more.

                                     CURLY
                         I'll pay the rest next trip. We only 
                         caught sixty ton of skipjack around 
                         San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, 
                         they don't pay you for skipjack the 
                         way they do for tuna or albacore.

                                     GITTES
                              (easing him out of 
                              his office)
                         Forget it. I only mention it to 
                         illustrate a point...

               INT. OFFICE RECEPTION

               He's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her 
               gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be 
               read: "J. J. GITTES and Associates. DISCREET INVESTIGATION"

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want your last dime.

               He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         What kind of guy do you think I am?

                                     CURLY
                         Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Call me Jake. Careful driving home, 
                         Curly.

               He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears.

               He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath.

                                     SOPHIE
                         A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you, 
                         with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

               Gittes nods, walks on in.

               INT. DUFFY AND WALSH'S OFFICE

               Walsh rises when Gittes enters.

                                     WALSH
                         Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. 
                         Gittes?

               Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic 
               smile.

                                     GITTES
                         How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Mr. Gittes...

                                     GITTES
                         Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be 
                         the problem?

               She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         My husband, I believe, is seeing 
                         another woman.

               Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to 
               his two partners.

                                     GITTES
                              (gravely)
                         No, really?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         I'm afraid so.

                                     GITTES
                         I am sorry.

               Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between 
               Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.

               Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. 
                         Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These 
                         men are my operatives and at some 
                         point they're going to assist me. I 
                         can't do everything myself.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Of course not.

                                     GITTES
                         Now, what makes you certain he is 
                         involved with someone?

               Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the 
               question.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         A wife can tell.

               Gittes sighs.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your 
                         husband?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                              (shocked)
                         ...Yes of course.

                                     GITTES
                              (deliberately)
                         Then go home and forget about it.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         But...

                                     GITTES
                              (staring intently at 
                              her)
                         I'm sure he loves you, too. You know 
                         the expression, let sleeping dogs 
                         lie? You're better off not knowing.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                              (with some real anxiety)
                         But I have to know.

               Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.

                                     GITTES
                         All right, what's your husband's 
                         first name?

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                              (visibly surprised)
                         Water and Power?

               Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but 
               carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray's dress 
                her handbag, shoes, etc.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         He's the Chief Engineer.

                                     DUFFY
                              (a little eagerly)
                         Chief Engineer?

               Gittes' glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the questioning. 
               Mrs. Mulwray nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (confidentially)
                         This type of investigation can be 
                         hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. 
                         It takes time.

                                     MRS. MULWRAY
                         Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. 
                         Gittes.

               Gittes sighs.

                                     GITTES
                         Very well. We'll see what we can do.

               EXT. CITY HALL  MORNING

               Already shimmering with heat.

               A drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at 
               the foot of the steps.

               Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up 
               the stairs.

               INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS

               Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge 
               map, with overleafs and bold lettering:

                        "PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR"

               Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip 
               columns while Bagby is speaking.

                                     BAGBY
                         Gentlemen, today you can walk out 
                         that door, turn right, hop on a 
                         streetcar and in twenty-five minutes 
                         end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. 
                         Now you can swim in it, you can fish 
                         in it, you can sail in it but you 
                         can't drink it, you can't water your 
                         lawns with it, you can't irrigate an 
                         orange grove with it.  Remember we 
                         live next door to the ocean but we 
                         also live on the edge of the desert. 
                         Los Angeles is a desert community. 
                         Beneath this building, beneath every 
                         street there's a desert. Without 
                         water the dust will rise up and cover 
                         us as though we'd never existed!
                              (pausing, letting the 
                              implication sink in)

               CLOSE  GITTES

               sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. He yawns, edges 
               away from one of the dirtier farmers.

                                     BAGBY (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         The Alto Vallejo can save us from 
                         that, and I respectfully suggest 
                         that eight and a half million dollars 
                         is a fair price to pay to keep the 
                         desert from our streets and not on 
                         top of them.

               AUDIENCE  COUNCIL CHAMBERS

               An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have 
               been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers 
               applaud.

               Somebody shooshes them.

               COUNCIL COMMITTEE

               In a whispered conference.

                                     COUNCILMAN
                              (acknowledging Bagby)
                         Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the 
                         departments again. I suppose we better 
                         take Water and Power first. Mr. 
                         Mulwray.

               REACTION  GITTES

               Looking up with interest from his racing form.

               MULWRAY

               Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in 
               his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising 
               fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The 
               man turns the overleaf on the map.

                                     MULWRAY
                         In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, 
                         over five hundred lives were lost 
                         when the Van der Lip Dam gave way 
                         core samples have shown that beneath 
                         this bedrock is shale similar to the 
                         permeable shale in the Van der Lip 
                         disaster.  It couldn't withstand 
                         that kind of pressure there.
                              (referring to a new 
                              overleaf)
                         Now you propose yet another dirt 
                         banked terminus dam with slopes of 
                         two and one half to one, one hundred 
                         twelve feet high and a twelve thousand 
                         acre water surface. Well, it won't 
                         hold. I won't build it. It's that 
                         simple. I am not making that kind of 
                         mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.

               Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly 
               there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the 
               chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, 
               bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.

                                     COUNCIL PRESIDENT
                              (shouting to farmer)
                         What in the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?
                              (as the sheep bleat 
                              down the aisles toward 
                              the Council)
                         Get those goddam things out of here!

                                     FARMER
                              (right back)
                         Tell me where to take them! You don't 
                         have an answer for that so quick, do 
                         you?

               Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations 
               of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the 
               farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to 
               bodily attack Mulwray.

                                     FARMER
                              (through above, to 
                              Mulwray)
                         You steal the water from the valley, 
                         ruin the grazing, starve my livestock 
                         who's paying you to do that, Mr. 
                         Mulwray, that's what I want to know!

               L.A. RIVERBED  LONG SHOT

               It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. 
               Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked 
               with weeds.

               After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood 
               control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray 
               gets out of the car. Me looks around.

               WITH GITTES

               Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the 
               flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. 
               He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of 
               the riverbed.

               There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at 
               the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.

               GITTES

               Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's 
               glasses.

               BELOW GITTES

               There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. 
               Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into 
               the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.

               MULWRAY

               Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power 
               lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water 
               at his feet.

               He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, 
               toward Gittes.

               GITTES

               Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in 
               the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the 
               muddy banks.

               Mulwray says something to the boy.

               The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. 
               The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud 
               and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.

               After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly 
               back upstream  scrambling up the bank to his car.

               There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of 
               blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the 
               hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking 
               downstream from time to time.

               The power lines overhead HUM.

               He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets 
               back in the car. He drives off.

               GITTES

               Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right 
               back out.

               The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back 
               seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in 
               and takes off.

               POINT FERMIN PARK  DUSK

               Street lights go on.

               MULWRAY

               Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park 
               lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.

               GITTES

               Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in 
               the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees 
               in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of 
               the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes 
               moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating 
               the climb than Mulwray did.

               DOWN ON THE BEACH

               Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear 
               crescent.

               He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's 
               apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then 
               moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in 
               order to be above Mulwray.

               AT THE OUTFALL

               Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.

               Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks 
               absently up toward Gittes.

               GITTES

               Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.

               BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN

               Flashing in the dust.

               CLOSE  GITTES

               Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He's in a puddle 
               of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.

               MULWRAY

               Below him in watching the water trickling down from the 
               outfall near Gittes.

               Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. 
               Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and 
               velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading 
               into the sea, whipping it into a foam.

               AT THE STREET  GITTES' CAR

               There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. 
               Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash 
               light. It says:

               "SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR 
               PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!! 
               VOTE YES NOVEMBER 6... CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY, 
               HON. SAM BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR  CHAIRMAN." Gittes grumbles, 
               crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other 
               flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.

               Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.

               INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT

               Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches.

               The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls out 
               one.

               He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. 
               It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind 
               the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again and heads 
               back to his own car.

               GITTES

               Arrives whistling, opens the door with "J.J. GITTES AND 
               ASSOCIATES  DISCREET INVESTIGATION" on it.

                                     GITTES
                         Morning, Sophie.

               Sophie hands him a small pile of messages. He goes through 
               them.

                                     GITTES
                         Walsh here?

                         He's in the dark room.

               Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh's. A little 
               red light is on in the corner, over a closed door. Gittes 
               walks over and knocks on the door.

                                     GITTES
                         Where'd he go yesterday?

                         water on the brain.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         What'd you expect? That's his job.

                                     GITTES
                         Listen, we can't string this broad 
                         out indefinitely we got to come up 
                         with something.

                         I think I got something.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?

                         It's on your desk. Say, you hear the 
                         one about the guy who goes to the 
                         North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking 
                         for penguins?

               Gittes walks to his office.

               ON HIS DESK

               Is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken, the hands stopped 
               at 2:47.

                                     GITTES
                         He was there all night.

               Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series 
               of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; eagerly)
                         So what you got?

               Walsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are a 
               series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man 
               whose appearance is striking. In two of the photos a gnarled 
               cane is visible.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; obviously 
                              annoyed)
                         This?

                                     WALSH
                         They got into a terrific argument 
                         outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

                                     GITTES
                         What about?

                                     WALSH
                         I don't know. The traffic was pretty 
                         loud. I only heard one thing  apple 
                         core.

                                     GITTES
                         Apple core?

                                     WALSH
                              (shrugs)
                         Yeah.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE

               Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust.

                                     GITTES
                         Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you 
                         spent your day doing?

                                     WALSH
                         Look, you tell me to take pictures, 
                         I take pictures.

                                     GITTES
                         Let me explain something to you, 
                         Walsh. This business requires a 
                         certain finesse.

               The PHONE has been RINGING. Sophie buzzes him.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, Sophie?
                              (he picks up the phone)
                         Duffy, where are you?

               Duffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly. "I got it. I got it. 
               He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in 
               Echo Park."

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Okay, slow down  Echo Park.
                              (to Walsh)
                         Jesus, water again.

               WESTLAKE PARK (MCARTHUR PARK)

               Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern.

               They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print 
               dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on 
               the girl.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Duffy, as they 
                              pass)
                         Let's have a big smile, pal.

               He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast 
               shots.

               Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.

               DUFFY

               Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes 
               again clicking off several fast shots.

               CLOSE SHOT  SIGN:

                                 "EL MACANDO APARTMENTS"

               MOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of 
               the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the 
               roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the 
               tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below 
               him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. Gittes is clicking 
               off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come 
               loose.

               Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the 
               roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to 
               slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide.

               Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain 
               and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his 
               feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the 
               veranda below. He stops as it's about to slide over the edge. 
               He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the 
               cracked edge of the tile falls.

               WITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL

               Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the 
               girl.

               He's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof.

               FROM HIS POV

               The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly 
               sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.

               In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart-
               shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken. 
               Next to it is a smaller column, "J.J. Gittes hired by 
               suspicious spouse."

               Holds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and his

                         When you get so much publicity, after 
                         a while you must get blasé about it.

               A self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face.

                                     BARNEY
                              (continuing)
                         Face it. You're practically a movie 
                         star.

               In b.g., customers can be OVERHEARD talking about the drought.

               Interspersed with above, someone is saying, "They're gonna 
               start rationing water unless it rains." Someone else says, 
               "Only for washing your cars." Third says, "You're not going 
               to be able to water your lawn either, or take a bath more 
               than once a week." First says, "If you don't have a lawn or 
               a car, do you get an extra bath?"

               Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car is 
               stalled.

               The hood is up. A man watches his radiator boiling over.

                                     GITTES

                         Tell me, how many people a week do 
                         you foreclose on?

                         We don't publish a record in the

                                     GITTES

                         No, you have a press agent do it.

               Gittes gets out of the chair. Barney, a little concerned, 
               tries to restrain him, holding onto the barber sheet around 
               Gittes' neck.

                                     GITTES

               Gittes is trying to take off his sheet.

                                     GITTES
                         C'mon, get out of the barber chair. 
                         We'll go outside and talk this over.

               The Customer is shrinking back into the chair.

                                     BARNEY
                         Hey, c'mon, Jake. Sit down. Sit down. 
                         You hear about the fella goes to his 
                         friend and says, 'What'll I do, I'm 
                         tired of screwing my wife?' and his 
                         friend says, 'Whyn't you do what the 
                         Chinese do?'

               Gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair.

                                     GITTES
                         I don't know how that got in the 
                         paper as a matter of fact  it 
                         surprised me it was so quick. I make 
                         an honest living.

                                     BARNEY
                         'Course you do, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                         An honest living.

                                     BARNEY
                              (continuing)
                         So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do 
                         what the Chinese do?'

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE

               Gittes comes bursting in, slapping a newspapers on his thigh.

                                     GITTES
                         Duffy, Walsh.

               Walsh comes out of his office, Duffy out of the other one.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Sophie, go to the little girl's room 
                         for a minute.

                                     SOPHIE
                         But, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (insisting)
                         Sophie.

                                     SOPHIE
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes.

               She gets up and leaves.

                                     GITTES
                         So there's this fella who's tired of 
                         screwing his wife.

                                     DUFFY
                         Jake, listen.

                                     GITTES
                         Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a 
                         hurry and his friend says why not do 
                         what the Chinese do? So he says what 
                         do they do? His friend says the 
                         Chinese they screw for a while. Just 
                         listen a second, Duffy...

               A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his doorway. 
               She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED MAN. They listen, 
               unseen by Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         ...and then they stop and they read 
                         a little Confucius and they screw 
                         some more and they stop and they 
                         smoke some opium and then they go 
                         back and screw some more and they 
                         stop again and they contemplate the 
                         moon or something and it makes it 
                         more exciting. So this other guy 
                         goes home to screw his wife and after 
                         a while he stops and gets up and 
                         goes into the other room only he 
                         reads Life Magazine and he goes back 
                         and he screws some more and suddenly 
                         says excuse me a second and he gets 
                         up and smokes a cigarette and he 
                         goes back and by this time his wife 
                         is getting sore as hell. So he screws 
                         some more and then he gets up to 
                         look at the moon and his wife says, 
                         'What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?
                              (Gittes breaks up)
                         ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'

               Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The 
               little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees 
               the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She's so 
               stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         Yes?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Do you know me?

                                     GITTES
                         Well... I think I... I would've 
                         remembered.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Have we ever met?

                                     GITTES
                         Well, no.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Never?

                                     GITTES
                         Never.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         That's what I thought. You see, I'm 
                         Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. 
                         Mulwray's wife.

               Gittes is staggered. He glances down at the newspaper.

                                     GITTES
                         Not that Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And 
                         since you agree with me we've never 
                         met, you must also agree that I 
                         haven't hired you to do anything. 
                         Certainly not spy on my husband. I 
                         see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. 
                         Well, you're going to get it.

                                     GITTES
                         Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...

               She's walked past him toward the door. He stop her.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         ...there's some misunderstanding 
                         here. It's not going to do any good 
                         to get tough with me.

               Evelyn flashes a cold smile.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't get tough with anybody, Mr. 
                         Gittes.  My lawyer does.

               Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This 
               time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come 
               out of his office and up behind him.

                                     GRAY-HAIRED MAN
                         Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

               Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons 
               and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door.

                                     GRAY-HAIRED MAN
                              (continuing; pleasantly)
                         I suppose we'll be hearing from your 
                         attorney.

               Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand.

               INT. GITTES' INNER OFFICE  GITTES, DUFFY & WALSH

               On Gittes' desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons 
               and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him 
               from the barber shop.

               The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing 
               gum is the loudest noise in the room.

               Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops 
               chewing.

               Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee 
               cups.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Duffy)
                         There's seven ashtrays in this room, 
                         Duffy.

                                     DUFFY
                         Okay.

                                     GITTES
                         That's a filthy habit.

                                     DUFFY
                         I said okay, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here 
                         saying she was Shirley Temple you'd 
                         say okay to that, too.

                                     WALSH
                         Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's 
                         real phone number and address.

                                     GITTES
                         All she needed for that was the phone 
                         book!

                                     WALSH
                         No, no. She said not to call, her 
                         husband might answer.

                                     GITTES
                         When I find out who that phony bitch 
                         was.

               Gittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly grabs 
               the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile breaks out 
               on his face.

               He buzzes Sophie.

                                     GITTES
                         Sophie.

                                     SOPHIE
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.
                              (as he waits)
                         And how about that snotty broad?
                              (the phone to his ear)
                         What does she think, she's perfect? 
                         Coming in waving her lawyers and her 
                         money at me  so goddam smug. She's 
                         no better than anybody else in this 
                         town.

               Sophie BUZZES.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah, 
                         listen, where did you get those 
                         photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse 
                         over the El Macando love nest.  That's 
                         cute, Whitey... so who sent them to 
                         you... I sent them?
                              (Gittes laughs a little 
                              hysterically)
                         Why would I be asking how you got 
                         them if I sent them?... Whitey?... 
                         Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for 
                         once, my tit's in the wringer and 
                         it's beginning to hurt... yeah...  
                         yeah... yeah.

               He hangs up.

                                     WALSH
                         So he says you sent them?

                                     GITTES
                              (after a moment)
                         They're all a bunch of phonies.

               INT. DEPARTMENT WATER & POWER  HALL

               Gittes stops outside a door marked:

                            "HOLLIS J. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"

               He enters an outer office. The SECRETARY looks surprised.

                                     GITTES
                         Mr. Mulwray, please.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's not in, Mr.?

                                     GITTES
                         Gittes.

                                     SECRETARY
                         May I ask what this is regarding?

                                     GITTES
                         It's personal. Has he been out long?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Since lunch.

                                     GITTES
                         Gee whiz.
                              (he glances at his 
                              watch)
                         And I'm late.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He was expecting you?

                                     GITTES
                         Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go 
                         in and wait?

               Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half 
               rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.

               MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE

               The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray 
               at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas 
               and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted 
               photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.

               Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in 
               the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he 
               does.

               He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly 
               examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't 
               open.

               He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.

               He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles 
               through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it, 
               finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a 
               Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,

               He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat 
               hand:

                      "Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used."

               Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent 
               pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the 
               drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses 
               off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on 
               the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.

               RUSS YELBURTON

               Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Can I help you?
                              (extending his hand)
                         Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the 
                         Department.

                                     GITTES
                              (equally pleasant)
                         J.J. Gittes. And it's not a 
                         departmental matter.

                                     YELBURTON
                         I wonder if you'd care to wait in my 
                         office?

               This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods, 
               follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices 
               down the hall.

                                     YELBURTON
                              (continuing; as they're 
                              going)
                         You see, this whole business in the 
                         paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on 
                         edge.

               INT. YELBURTON OFFICE

               Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered 
               marlin mounted on the wall. There are a couple of other 
               pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's 
               standing beside.

               There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C. 
               below it, tacked onto the wall.

                                     YELBURTON
                         After all, you work with a man for a 
                         certain length of time, you come to 
                         know him, his habits, his values, 
                         and so forth. Well either he's the 
                         kind who chases after women or he 
                         isn't.

                                     GITTES
                         And Mulwray isn't?

                                     YELBURTON
                         He never even kids about it.

                                     GITTES
                         Maybe he takes it very seriously.

               Gittes winks. Yelburton chuckles appreciatively, loosening 
               up a little.

                                     GITTES
                         You don't happen to know where Mr. 
                         Mulwray's having lunch?

                                     YELBURTON
                         I'm sorry, I --

                                     GITTES
                         Well, tell him I'll be back.

               Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Mind if I take one of your cards?  
                         In case I want to get in touch with 
                         you again.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Help yourself.

               Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his 
               handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running 
               into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about 
               GITTES' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in 
               a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper 
               bag.

                                     GITTES
                         Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?

               OUTER OFFICE  YELBURTON, MULVIHILL AND GITTES

               Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains by 
               the desk.

                                     MULVIHILL
                         They shut my water off, what's it to 
                         you?

                                     GITTES
                         How'd you find out? You don't drink 
                         it, you don't take a bath in it, 
                         maybe they sent you a letter. Ah, 
                         but then you'd have to be able to 
                         read.

               Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury. Yelburton 
               steps between them.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.
                              (to Yelburton)
                         Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

                                     YELBURTON
                         Hope so. He's working for us.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOUSE  GITTES

               Rings the bell. He waits.

               A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-jacket 
               of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.

                                     GITTES
                         J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

               He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler 
               takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the 
               doorway.

               Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim 
               a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet 
               off the porch.

               POV  GARAGE

               A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a 
               chamois.

               Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come 
               from the chamois.

               CHINESE BUTLER

               In doorway.

                                     CHINESE BUTLER
                         Please.

               Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for 
               him to follow.

               THROUGH THE HOUSE  GITTES

               Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A 
               maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some 
               French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with 
               running water.

                                     CHINESE BUTLER
                         You wait, please.

               Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet 
               except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. 
               After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles 
               at Gittes, probes into the pond.

               There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes 
               it.

               After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters 
               recede.

               EXT. POND  GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER  DAY

                                     GARDENER
                              (to Gittes)
                         Bad for glass.

                                     GITTES
                              (not understanding)
                         Yeah sure. Bad for glass.

               The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the 
               object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.

               He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks 
               it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the 
               gleaming object.

               He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the 
               trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto 
               it for poise.

               Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside 
               of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.

               She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks 
               younger than she did in the office.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes?

               Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed 
               as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.

                                     GITTES
                         Actually, I'm here to see your 
                         husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

               He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There 
               is none.

               The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.

                                     EVELYN
                         Would you like something to drink?

                                     GITTES
                         What are you having?

                                     EVELYN
                         Iced tea.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Fine, thank you.

               Chinese Butler nods, disappears

               EXT. POND AND GARDEN  MULWRAY HOUSE  DAY

               Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her.

                                     EVELYN
                         My husband's at the office.

                                     GITTES
                         Actually he's not. And he's moved 
                         from his apartment at the El Macando.

                                     EVELYN
                              (sharply)
                         That's not his apartment.

                                     GITTES
                         Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be 
                         loved, but I am in business, and 
                         believe me, whoever set up your 
                         husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small 
                         town, people talk.

               He waits for a response. Then:

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; uneasily)
                         I'm just trying to make a living, 
                         and I don't want to become a local 
                         Joke.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into 
                         it. I'll drop the lawsuit.

                                     GITTES
                         What?

                                     EVELYN
                         I said I'll drop it.

               The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between 
               them.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing; pleasantly)
                         So let's just drop the whole thing. 
                         Sugar?  Lemon?

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                              (as she's mixing one 
                              of the drinks)
                         Yes, Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want to drop it.

               Evelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly.

                                     GITTES
                         I should talk this over with your 
                         husband.

                                     EVELYN
                              (a little concerned)
                         Why?... What on earth for?  Look, 
                         Hollis seems to think you're an 
                         innocent man.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, I've been accused of many 
                         things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.

               Again he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         You see, somebody went to a lot of 
                         trouble here, and I want to find 
                         out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not 
                         the one who's supposed to be caught 
                         with my pants down... so I'd like to 
                         see your husband. Unless that's a 
                         problem.

                                     EVELYN
                              (with a slight edge)
                         What do you mean?

                                     GITTES
                         May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                         You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (determined to be 
                              polite)
                         Well, that little girlfriend, she 
                         was attractive in a cheap sort of 
                         way of course.  She's disappeared. 
                         Maybe they disappeared together 
                         somewhere.

                                     EVELYN
                              (with rising anger)
                         Suppose they did. How does it concern 
                         you?

                                     GITTES
                         Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I 
                         just --

                                     EVELYN
                         It's very personal. It couldn't be 
                         more personal. Is this a business or 
                         an obsession with you?

                                     GITTES
                         Look at it this way. Now this phony 
                         broad, excuse the language, says 
                         she's you, she's hired me. Whoever 
                         put her up to it, didn't have anything 
                         against me. They were out to get 
                         your husband. Now if I see him, I 
                         can help him.  Did you talk this 
                         morning?

               Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans.

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I went riding rather early.

                                     GITTES
                         Looks like you went quite a distance.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, Just riding bareback, that's 
                         all. Anyway, you might try the Oak 
                         Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. 
                         Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks 
                         around them. Otherwise he'll be home 
                         by 6:30.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll stop by.

                                     EVELYN
                         Please call first.

               Gittes nods.

               EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR  DAY

               Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel 
               up into the parched hills.

               TWO FIRE TRUCKS

               One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.

               The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there 
               are people milling around. The reservoir is below.

               Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.

                                     GUARD
                         Sorry, this is closed to the public, 
                         sir.

               Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:

                                     GITTES
                              (to the Guard)
                         It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy 
                         Chief in the Department.

               He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief 
               pocket, hands it to the Guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.

               Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the 
               reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.

               Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their 
               backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the 
               reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently 
               dredging for something.

               One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes 
               and is visibly shocked.

                                     LOACH
                         Gittes, for Chrissakes.

                                     GITTES
                         Loach.

                                     LOACH
                              (moving to Gittes, 
                              taking him by the 
                              arm)
                         C'mon, get out of here before --

               EXT. RESERVOIR  DAY

               Loach tries to ease him down the path.

                                     GITTES
                         Before what? What the hell's going 
                         on?

               At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge 
               of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns 
               around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties, 
               LUIS ESCOBAR.

               Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at 
               seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy.

               Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Hello, Jake.

                                     GITTES
                              (without smiling)
                         How are you, Lou?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I have a cold I can't seem to shake 
                         but other than that, I'm fine.

                                     GITTES
                         Summer colds are the worst.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Yeah, they are.

               Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case.

                                     A FIREMAN
                         No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard 
                         this time of year.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I think we can make an exception. 
                         I'll see he's careful with the 
                         matches.

                                     GITTES
                              (lighting up)
                         Thanks, Lou.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         How'd you get past the guards?

                                     GITTES
                         Well, to tell you the truth, I lied 
                         a little.

               Escobar nods. They walk a couple of steps. The other police, 
               two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You've done well by yourself.

                                     GITTES
                         I get by.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Well, sometimes it takes a while for 
                         a man to find himself and I guess 
                         you have.

                                     LOACH
                         Poking around in other people's dirty 
                         linen.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Tell me, you still throw 
                         Chinamen into jail for spitting on 
                         the laundry?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You're behind the times, Jake. They've 
                         got steam irons now.
                              (smiles)
                         And I'm out of Chinatown.

                                     GITTES
                         Since when?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Since I made Lieutenant.

               It's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself.

                                     GITTES
                         Congratulations.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?

                                     GITTES
                         Looking for someone.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Who?

                                     GITTES
                         Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Oh yes.

                                     GITTES
                         I'd like to talk to him.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You're welcome to try. There he is.

               Escobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using 
               poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be 
               SEEN that one of them has hooked something.

               He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing 
               the soaking back of a man's coat. They start to pull the 
               body into the skiff.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE  EVELYN AND ESCOBAR

               Are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet 
               drawn back. Evelyn nods.

               Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet 
               to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying 
               to keep the corpse from hearing them.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         It looks like he was washed the entire 
                         length of the runoff channel. Could 
                         he swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Of course.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Obviously the fall must have knocked 
                         him out.

               Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant 
               wheels the body out of the office.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (continuing)
                         This alleged affair he was having. 
                         The publicity didn't make him morose 
                         or unhappy?

               OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S

               Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and 
               listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the 
               doorway.

               Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...Well, it didn't make him happy...

                                     ESCOBAR
                         But there is no possibility he would 
                         have taken his own life?

                                     EVELYN
                              (sharply)
                         No.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (a little uncomfortably 
                              now)
                         Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know 
                         the name of the young woman in 
                         question?

               Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance.

                                     EVELYN
                         No.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Do you know where she might be?

                                     EVELYN
                         Certainly not!

               Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You and your husband never discussed 
                         her?

                                     EVELYN
                              (stopping, faltering)
                         He... we did... he wouldn't tell me 
                         her name.  We quarreled over her... 
                         of course. It came as a complete 
                         surprise to me.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         A complete surprise?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         But I thought you'd hired a private 
                         investigator.

                                     EVELYN
                         A private investigator?

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (gesturing vaguely 
                              toward the door)
                         Mr. Gittes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well yes.

               Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a 
               foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look at one another 
               for a long moment.

                                     EVELYN
                              (her eyes on Gittes)
                         But I... I... did that because I 
                         thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put 
                         an end to...

               She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is right 
               at her back. Gittes says nothing.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         And when did Mr. Gittes inform you 
                         that these rumors had some foundation 
                         in fact?

               Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.

                                     GITTES
                              (smoothly)
                         Just before the story broke in the 
                         papers, Lou.

               Escobar nods. They begin to walk slowly, again have to move 
               out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of 
               one of the Coroner cubicles.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You wouldn't happen to know the 
                         present whereabouts of the young 
                         woman.

                                     GITTES
                         No.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Or her name?

                                     GITTES
                         No.

               They have walked a few steps further down the hall.

                                     EVELYN
                         Will you need me for anything else, 
                         Lieutenant?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of 
                         course you have my deepest sympathy 
                         and if we need anymore information, 
                         we'll be in touch.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll walk her to her car, be right 
                         back.

               ESCOBAR'S POV

               Evelyn glances at Gittes. They go through a couple of outer 
               doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer 
               hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in 
               L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."

               Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking 
               questions. Gittes brushes them aside.

               EVELYN AND GITTES  AT HER CAR

               In a small parking lot.

               Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something 
               in her purse.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                              (flushed, perspiring)
                         ...Just a minute...

                                     GITTES
                              (touching her gently)
                         You left your keys in the ignition.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... thank you.

               She glances down, leans against the side of the car.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing)
                         Thank you for going along with me. I 
                         just didn't want to explain 
                         anything... I'll send you a check.

                                     GITTES
                              (puzzled)
                         A check?

               Evelyn gets in her car.

                                     EVELYN
                         To make it official, I hired you.

               She drives off, leaving Gittes gaping.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE HALLWAY

                                     GITTES
                         Don't give me that, Lou. You hauled 
                         me down here for a statement.

               Escobar shrugs.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I don't want it anymore.

                                     GITTES
                         No?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         No. It was an accident.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean that's what you're going to 
                         call it.

               Escobar looks up.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         That's right.
                              (contemptuously)
                         Out of respect for his civic position.

               Resume walking.

               Gittes laughs.

                                     GITTES
                         What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at 
                         your sister?

               Escobar stops.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         No, he drowned a cousin of mine with 
                         about five hundred other people. But 
                         they weren't very important, just a 
                         bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a 
                         dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't 
                         come out of this smelling like a 
                         rose, you know.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh yeah? Can you think of something 
                         to charge me with?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         When I do, you'll hear about it.

               Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.

               OUTSIDE MORGUE

               Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with 
               Mulwray's name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an 
               adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement 
               that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of 
               Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Another Coroner's 
               assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating 
               a sandwich.

               Gittes ambles into the room.

                                     MORTY
                              (a cigarette dangling 
                              out of his mouth)
                         Jake, what're you doin' here?

                                     GITTES
                         Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, 
                         I thought I'd drop by and see who 
                         died lately.

               Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS 
               FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body. Eyes open, the face badly 
               cut and bruised.

                                     MORTY
                         Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle 
                         of a drought, the water commissioner 
                         drowns. Only in L.A.

                                     GITTES
                              (looking at. Mulwray)
                         Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.

                                     MORTY
                         That's a long fall.

                                     GITTES
                         So how are you, Morty?

               Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an 
               assistant.

                                     MORTY
                         Never better. You know me, Jake.

               As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks 
               into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other 
               body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                              (picking up on cough)
                         Yeah, so who you got there?

               Morty pulls back the sheet.

                                     MORTY
                         Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to 
                         hang around Ferguson's Alley.

               Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.

                                     MORTY
                              (continuing)
                         Quite a character. Lately he'd been 
                         living in one of the downtown storm 
                         drains. Had a bureau dresser down 
                         there and everything.

               Gittes has already lost interest. He starts away.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     MORTY
                         Drowned, too.

               This stops Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Come again?

                                     MORTY
                         Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in 
                         the bottom of the riverbed.

                                     GITTES
                         The L.A. River?

                                     MORTY
                              (a little puzzled)
                         Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's 
                         wrong with that?

               Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.

                                     GITTES
                         It's bone dry, Morty.

                                     MORTY
                         It's not completely dry.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a 
                         damp riverbed either, I don't care 
                         how soused he was. That's like 
                         drowning in a teaspoon.

               Morty shrugs.

                                     MORTY
                         We got water out of him, Jake. He 
                         drowned.

               Gittes walks away mumbling.

                                     GITTES
                         Jesus, this town...

               EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD  GITTES  DAY

               He's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on 
               one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the 
               riverbed below.

               FROM THE BRIDGE

               Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its 
               contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying 
               half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank 
               of the river is a sign that proclaims "OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE 
               IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of 
               sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford 
               seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of 
               Shuhardt's home.

               Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near 
               the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes 
               pulls it out, swearing.

               He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears 
               the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.

               Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican 
               Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy 
               bank.

               They look at one another a moment.

                                     GITTES
                              (calling out to him)
                         You were riding here the other day, 
                         weren't you...?

               The Boy doesn't answer.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Speak English?... Habla Ingles?

                                     THE BOY
                              (finally)
                         Si.

                                     GITTES
                         Didn't you talk to a man here... few 
                         days ago... wore glasses... he...

               The Boy nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         What did you talk about, mind my 
                         asking?

               The shadows of the two are very long now.

                                     THE BOY
                              (finally)
                         The water.

                                     GITTES
                         What about the water?

                                     THE BOY
                         When it comes.

                                     GITTES
                         When it comes? What'd you tell him?

                                     THE BOY
                         Comes in different parts of the river. 
                         Every night a different part.

               Gittes nods. The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.

               EXT. RIVERBED  DUSK

               Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the 
               storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above 
               toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting.

               EXT. GITTES IN CAR  NIGHTFALL

               Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills. He picks 
               up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's 
               windwing.

               GITTES IN CAR  MOVING

               Along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows 
               the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork in 
               the road which allows him to continue following the flood 
               channel.

               FURTHER UP  MOVING

               The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is 
               overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.

               STILL FURTHER  NIGHT

               The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus 
               are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-
               shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be 
               GLIMPSED.

               POV  CHAIN-LINK FENCE

               Over the road, bolted. It says "OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP 
               OUT. NO TRESPASSING."

               The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel 
               and down into it, making access along the channel itself 
               impossible.

               Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the 
               spotlight.

               A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole 
               illumination.

               There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.

               Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood 
               channel itself.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE

               Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage 
               toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the 
               reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.

               Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into 
               the flood control channel, which is at this point about four 
               feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men 
               scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. 
               Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.

               He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is 
               another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles 
               Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.

               GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL  NIGHT

               Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over 
               him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging 
               into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the 
               overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of 
               the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's 
               brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. 
               He's nearly strained through it.

               Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing 
               water by means of the fence itself.

               Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and 
               makes his way toward his car.

               AT GITTES' CAR

               He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.

                                     GITTES
                              (grumbling)
                         Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.

               He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER 
               MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning 
               his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a 
               switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left 
               nostril.

                                     SMALLER MAN
                              (shaking with emotion)
                         Hold it there, kitty cat.

               CLOSE  GITTES

               Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead 
               gleaming on the silvery blade.

                                     THE SMALLER MAN
                         You are a very nosey fellow, kitty 
                         cat... you know what happens to nosey 
                         fellows?

               The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage 
               when he says this. Gittes doesn't move.

                                     SMALLER MAN
                              (continuing)
                         Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their 
                         noses.

               With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, 
               laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes 
               screams.

               Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.

               Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood 
               from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller Man 
               stare at him.

                                     THE SMALLER MAN
                              (continuing)
                         Next time you lose the whole thing, 
                         kitty cat. I'll cut it off and feed 
                         it to my goldfish, understand?

                                     MULVIHILL
                         Tell him you understand, Gittes.

               EXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR  NIGHT

               Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees.

                                     GITTES
                              (mumbling)
                         I understand...

               Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone 
               brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his 
               blood.

               THE SHOE

               Comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground. The SOUND 
               of FOOTSTEPS RETREATING, Gittes gasping.

               INT. GITTES' OFFICE  GITTES

               Sits behind his desk, BACK TO CAMERA, not moving. Duffy sits 
               staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the room.

               The PHONE is RINGING. Sophie BUZZES.

                                     GITTES
                              (pressing down intercom)
                         Yeah, Sophie.

                                     SOPHIE'S VOICE
                         A Miss Sessions calling.

                                     GITTES
                         Who?

                                     SOPHIE'S VOICE
                         Ida Sessions.

                                     GITTES
                         Don't know her. Take a number.

               NEW ANGLE  REVEALING

               A bandage spread-eagled across Gittes' nose.

                                     WALSH
                         So some contractor wants to build a 
                         dam and he makes a few payoffs. So 
                         what?

               Gittes turns slowly to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose.

                                     WALSH
                              (continuing)
                         Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll 
                         claim you were trespassing.

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the 
                         big boys that are making the payoffs.

                                     DUFFY
                         Then what'll you do?

                                     GITTES
                         Sue the shit out of 'em.

                                     WALSH
                         Yeah?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? 
                         Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. 
                         We'll make a killing.
                              (a dazzling smile)
                         We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice 
                         a week, we'll be pissing on ice the 
                         rest of our lives.

                                     WALSH
                         Sue people like that they're liable 
                         to be having dinner with the Judge 
                         who's trying the suit.

               Gittes looks irritated. The PHONE RINGS again.

                                     SOPHIE'S VOICE
                         Miss Ida Sessions again. She says 
                         you know her.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay.

               Gittes picks up the phone. He winks to his boys.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe 
                         we've had the pleasure.

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. 
                         Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                              (clowning a little 
                              for the boys)
                         Isn't everybody? What can I do for 
                         you, Miss Sessions?

               Walsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story.

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. 
                         I didn't come in to see you on my 
                         own.

                                     GITTES
                         When did you come in?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         I was the one who pretended to be 
                         Mrs. Mulwray, remember?

               Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are 
               laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing 
               through and puts his hand over the receiver.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Duffy and Walsh)
                         Shut the fuck up!
                              (then back to Ida)
                         ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss 
                         Sessions, just going over a detail 
                         or two with my associates... you 
                         were saying?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Well I never expected anything to 
                         happen like what happened to Mr. 
                         Mulwray, the point is if it ever 
                         comes out I want somebody to know I 
                         didn't know what would happen.

                                     GITTES
                         I understand... if you could tell me 
                         who employed you, Miss Sessions. 
                         That could help us both.

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         Oh no.

                                     GITTES
                         ...Why don't you give me your address 
                         and we can talk this over?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the 
                         obituary column of today's Times...

                                     GITTES
                         The obituary column?

                                     IDA'S VOICE
                         You'll find one of those people.

                                     GITTES
                         'Those people?' Miss Sessions.

               She hangs up. Gittes looks to his two men.

               INT. BROWN DERBY  CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER

               Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the 
               OBITUARY COLUMN, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column 
               from the paper and puts it in his pocket.

               When he closes the paper we can SEE headlines in the left 
               hand column: "WATER BOND ISSUE PASSES COUNCIL". Ten million 
               dollar referendum to go before the public.

               Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He 
               rises, allows her to sit.

               Gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly... She's 
               wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks for coming... drink?

               The waiter's appeared. Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tom Collins with lime, not lemon, 
                         please.

               Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. When she looks 
               back up she stares expectantly at Gittes.

               Gittes pulls out a torn envelope. The initials ECM can be 
               SEEN in a delicate scroll on the corner of it.

                                     GITTES
                         I got your check in the mall.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

               Gittes' fingers the envelope. He coughs.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not 
                         good enough.

                                     EVELYN
                              (a little embarrassed)
                         Well, how much would you like?

               CLOSE ON EVELYN

                                     GITTES
                         Stop it. The money's fine. It's 
                         generous but you've shortchanged me 
                         on the story.

                                     EVELYN
                              (coolly)
                         I have?

                                     GITTES
                         I think so. Something besides your 
                         husband's death was bothering you. 
                         You were upset but not that upset.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mr. Gittes...
                              (icily)
                         Don't tell me how I feel.

               The drinks come. The waiter sets them down.

                                     GITTES
                         Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband 
                         dies, you drop the lawsuit like a 
                         hot potato, and all of it quicker 
                         than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse 
                         me. Then you ask me to lie to the 
                         police.

                                     EVELYN
                         It wasn't much of a lie.

                                     GITTES
                         If your husband was killed it was.
                              (meaning check)
                         This can look like you paid me off 
                         to withhold evidence.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he wasn't killed.

               Gittes smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         I think you're hiding something, 
                         Mrs. Mulwray.

               Evelyn remains unperturbed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well, I suppose I am... actually I 
                         knew about the affair.

                                     GITTES
                         How did you find out?

                                     EVELYN
                         My husband.

                                     GITTES
                         He told you?

               Evelyn nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         And you weren't the slightest bit 
                         upset about it?

                                     EVELYN
                         I was grateful.

               Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.

                                     GITTES
                         You'll have to explain that, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why?

                                     GITTES
                              (a flash of annoyance)
                         Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my 
                         metiay.  When a wife tells me she's 
                         happy her husband is cheating on her 
                         it runs contrary to my experience.

               Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         Unless what?

                                     GITTES
                              (looking directly at 
                              her)
                         She's cheating on him.

               Evelyn doesn't reply.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Were you?

               Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't like the word 'cheat.'

                                     GITTES
                         Did you have affairs?

                                     EVELYN
                              (flashing)
                         Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Did he know?

                                     EVELYN
                              (almost an outburst)
                         Well I wouldn't run home and tell 
                         him whenever I went to bed with 
                         someone, if that's what you mean.

               This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing; more 
                              calmly)
                         Is there anything else you want to 
                         know?

                                     GITTES
                         Where you were when your husband 
                         died.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't tell you.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean you don't know where you 
                         were?

                                     EVELYN
                         I mean I can't tell you.

                                     GITTES
                         You were seeing someone, too.

               Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn't deny it.

                                     GITTES
                         For very long?

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't see anyone for very long, 
                         Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. 
                         Now I think you know all you need to 
                         about me. I didn't want publicity. I 
                         didn't want to go into any of this, 
                         then or now. Is this all?

               Gittes nods.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand 
                         for?

               He's been fingering the envelope...

                                     EVELYN
                              (she stammers slightly)
                         K... Cross.

                                     GITTES
                         That your maiden name?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes... why?

                                     GITTES
                         No reason.

               Evelyn turns into Gittes.

                                     EVELYN
                         You must've had a reason to ask me 
                         that.

                                     GITTES
                              (shrugs)
                         No. I'm just a snoop.

                                     EVELYN
                         You seem to have had a reason for 
                         every other question.

                                     GITTES
                         No, not for that one.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe you.

               Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.

                                     GITTES
                              (moving in)
                         Do me a favor. Sit still and act 
                         like I'm charming.

               Evelyn involuntarily draws back.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         There's somebody here. Say something.
                         Anything. Something like we're being 
                         intimate.

               Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle 
               his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                              (meaning his nose)
                         How did it happen?

                                     GITTES
                              (quietly)
                         Been meaning to talk to you about 
                         that.

                                     EVELYN
                              (quietly)
                         Maybe putting your nose in other 
                         people's business?

                                     GITTES
                              (quietly)
                         More like other people putting their 
                         business in my nose.

               Evelyn actually smiles a little.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         You son of a bitch.

               Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Match. How're you?

               MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a 
               glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, 
               and a menacing look in her eye.

                                     MRS. MATCH
                         Don't give me that, you son of a 
                         bitch.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay.

               Gittes turns back to Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                              (softly)
                         Another satisfied client?

                                     GITTES
                         Another satisfied client's wife.

                                     MRS. MATCH
                         Look at me, you son of a bitch. You... 
                         you bastard. Are you happy, are you 
                         happy now?

               She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes 
               covers himself. Waiters rush over.

                                     MRS. MATCH
                         You smug son of a bitch. My husband's 
                         so upset he sweats all night! How do 
                         you think that makes me feel?

                                     GITTES
                         Sweaty?

               Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him 
               on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out 
               from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.

               Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs 
               her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried 
               to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.

                                     GITTES
                         Let's get out of here before she 
                         picks up her purse.

               They rise and move toward the door.

                                     EVELYN
                              (quietly)
                         Tough guy, huh?

               Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.

               OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT  DUSK

               Gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. The 
               attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh, no. I've got my own car. The 
                         creamcolored Packard.

                                     GITTES
                              (to attendant who 
                              dutifully starts for 
                              her car)
                         Wait a minute, sonny.
                              (to Evelyn)
                         I think you better come with me.

                                     EVELYN
                         What for? There's nothing more to 
                         say.
                              (to attendant)
                         Get my car, please.

               The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the 
               open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but 
               spits it out.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay, go home. But in case you're 
                         interested your husband was murdered. 
                         Somebody's dumping tons of water out 
                         of the city reservoirs when we're 
                         supposedly in the middle of a drought, 
                         he found out, and he was killed. 
                         There's a waterlogged drunk in the 
                         morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if 
                         anybody wants to take the trouble 
                         which they don't. It looks like half 
                         the city is trying to cover it all 
                         up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.
                              (now inches from her)
                         I goddam near lost my nose! And I 
                         like it. I like breathing through 
                         it. And I still think you're hiding 
                         something.

               Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at 
               Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door 
               closed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mr. Gittes.

               He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn 
               looking after him.

               INT. DWP  MULWRAY'S OFFICE DOOR

               WITH ITS LETTERING:

                            "HOLLIS I. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"

               Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary. She looks up. 
               She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.

                                     GITTES
                         J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

               The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner 
               office.

               Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He sees 
               a photographic display of "THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY 
               YEARS", along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the 
               man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is 
               standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption 
               reads "JULIAN CROSS. 1905".

               Cross is strikingly handsome.

               Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's 
               check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down 
               under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.

               The Secretary returns.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some 
                         time.

                                     GITTES
                         Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's liable to be tied up 
                         indefinitely.

                                     GITTES
                         I take a long lunch. All day 
                         sometimes.

               Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one. 
               She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You 
               Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more 
               photographs.

               INT. MULWRAY'S OFFICES

               Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along 
               with Julian Cross. One of the captions: "HOLLIS MULWRAY AND 
               JULIAN CROSS AS THE AQUEDUCT CLEARS THE SANTA SUSANNAH PASS. 
               1912".

               Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary.

                                     GITTES
                         Julian Cross worked for the water 
                         department?

                                     SECRETARY
                              (looking up)
                         Yes. No.

                                     GITTES
                              (humming, then)
                         He did or he didn't?

                                     SECRETARY
                         He owned it.

               Gittes is genuinely surprised at this.

                                     GITTES
                         He owned the water department?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                         He owned the entire water supply for 
                         the city?

                                     SECRETARY
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                              (really surprised)
                         How did they get it away from him?

                                     SECRETARY
                              (a sigh, then)
                         Mr. Mulwray felt the public should 
                         own the display. The water. If you'll 
                         just read the display.

                                     GITTES
                              (glances back, hums, 
                              then)
                         Mulwray? I thought you said Cross 
                         owned the department.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Along with Mr. Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         They were partners.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (testily)
                         Yes. Yes, they were partners.

               She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office.

               Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING 
               SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.

               He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. 
               Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the 
               outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.

               The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (to Gittes)
                         Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

               Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office.

               INT. DWP  YELBURTON & GITTES

               There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's 
               attitude. He's now head of the department.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. 
                         These staff meetings, they just go 
                         on and on.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, must be especially tough to 
                         take over under these circumstances.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Oh yes. Hollis was the best department 
                         head the city's ever had. My goodness, 
                         what happened to your nose?

                                     GITTES
                              (smiles)
                         I cut myself shaving.

                                     YELBURTON
                         You ought to be more careful. That 
                         must really smart.

                                     GITTES
                         Only when I breathe.

                                     YELBURTON
                              (laughing)
                         Only when you breathe... don't tell 
                         me you're still working for Mrs. 
                         Mulwray?

                                     GITTES
                         I never was.

                                     YELBURTON
                              (stops smiling)
                         I don't understand.

                                     GITTES
                         Neither do I, actually. But you hired 
                         me or you hired that chippie to hire 
                         me.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit 
                         of sense.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, look at it this way, Mr. 
                         Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to 
                         build a dam and he had a reputation 
                         that was hard to get around, so.  
                         you decided to ruin it. Then he found 
                         out that you were dumping water every 
                         night. Then he was drowned.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous 
                         accusation.  I don't know what you're 
                         talking about.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the 
                         Times will. Dumping thousands of 
                         gallons of water down the toilet in 
                         the middle of a drought.  That's 
                         news.

               Gittes heads toward the door.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. 
                         We're... well, we're not anxious for 
                         this to get around, but we have been 
                         diverting a little water to irrigate 
                         avocado and walnut groves in the 
                         northwest valley. As you know, the 
                         farmers there have no legal right to 
                         our water, and since the drought 
                         we've had to cut them off. The city 
                         comes first, naturally.  But, well, 
                         we've been trying to help some of 
                         them out, keep them from going under.  
                         Naturally when you divert water you 
                         get a little runoff.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, a little runoff. Where are 
                         those orchards?

                                     YELBURTON
                         I said, the northwest valley.

                                     GITTES
                         That's like saying they're in Arizona.

                                     YELBURTON
                         Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and 
                         I can't give you an exact location...

               Gittes nods.

                                     GITTES
                         You're a married man, am I right?

                                     YELBURTON
                         Yes...

                                     GITTES
                         Hard working, have a wife and kids...

                                     YELBURTON
                         Yes...

                                     GITTES
                         I don't want to nail you. I just 
                         want to know who put you up to it.  
                         I'll give you a few days to think it 
                         over.
                              (hands him a card)
                         Call me. I can help. Who knows?  
                         Maybe we can lay the whole thing off 
                         on a few big shots and you can stay 
                         head of the department for the next 
                         twenty years.

               Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton.

               INT. GITTES OFFICE

               Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries 
               to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office.

               EVELYN MULWRAY

               Is sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters.

                                     EVELYN
                         What's your usual salary?

               Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight 
               of her.

                                     GITTES
                         Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty 
                         for each of my operators, plus 
                         expenses, plus my fee if I show 
                         results.

               He's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very 
               shaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         Whoever's behind my husband's death, 
                         why have they gone to all this 
                         trouble?

                                     GITTES
                         Money. How they plan to make it by 
                         emptying the reservoirs, that I don't 
                         know.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'll pay your salary plus five 
                         thousand dollars if you find out 
                         what happened to Hollis and who is 
                         involved.

               Gittes buzzes Sophie.

                                     GITTES
                         Sophie, draw up one of our standard 
                         forms for Mrs. Mulwray.
                              (he leans back; to 
                              Evelyn)
                         Tell me, did you get married before 
                         or after Mulwray and your father 
                         sold the water department?

               Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Your father is Julian Cross, isn't 
                         he?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, of course. It was quite a while 
                         after. I was just out of grade school 
                         when they did that.

                                     GITTES
                         So you married your father's business 
                         partner?

               Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; staring 
                              at her, points to 
                              the ashtray)
                         You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh.

               She quickly stubs one out.

                                     GITTES
                         Is there something upsetting about 
                         my asking about your father?

                                     EVELYN
                         No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis 
                         and my fa... my father had a falling 
                         out...

                                     GITTES
                         Over the water department, or over 
                         you?

                                     EVELYN
                              (quickly)
                         Not over me. Why would they have a 
                         falling out over me?

                                     GITTES
                              (noting her nervousness)
                         Then it was over the water department.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes 
                         and no.  Hollis felt the public should 
                         own the water but I don't think my 
                         father felt that way.  Actually, it 
                         was over the Van der Lip. The dam 
                         that broke.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He never forgave him for it.

                                     GITTES
                         Never forgave him for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For talking him into building it, he 
                         never forgave my father... They 
                         haven't spoken to this day.

                                     GITTES
                              (starts a little)
                         You sure shout that?

                                     EVELYN
                         Of course I'm sure.

                                     GITTES
                         What about you? Do you and your father 
                         get along?

               Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply. 
               Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn.

                                     GITTES
                         Sign here... The other copy's for 
                         you.

               She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring 
               intently at her.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you thinking?

                                     GITTES
                              (picking up one of 
                              copies, folding it, 
                              putting it in his 
                              pocket)
                         Before this I turned on the faucet, 
                         it came out hot and cold, I didn't 
                         think there was a thing to it.

               INT. SEAPLANE

               The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his 
               way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which 
               is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing 
               gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along.

               One of the old men says something to him.

                                     GITTES
                              (above the engines)
                         What?

                                     OLD MAN
                         You'll have to sit with the pilot.

               Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up  
               nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese 
               sandwich out of Gittes' seat.

               EXT. HARBOR - SEAPLANE

               Taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it kicks up 
               a spray of foam and takes off.

               INT. COCKPIT

               The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and 
               Gittes.

               The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably 
               dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane.

                                     PILOT
                              (above the engines)
                         Well, you're not going fishing.

               Gittes shakes his head.

                                     GITTES
                         Not exactly.

                                     PILOT
                              (winks)
                         But that's what you told your wife.

               The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely.

                                     PILOT
                         Lots of fellas do. Tell the little 
                         woman they're going on a fishing 
                         trip, then shack up with some little 
                         twist on the island... she pretty?

                                     GITTES
                              (abruptly)
                         I'm going to see a man called Julian 
                         Cross. Ever heard of him?

                                     PILOT
                         Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, 
                         mister?... I ask because he doesn't 
                         see a whole lot of people.

                                     GITTES
                         I'm working for his daughter.

                                     PILOT
                              (surprised)
                         That right?... She used to be some 
                         looker.

                                     GITTES
                         She ain't exactly long in the tooth 
                         now.

                                     PILOT
                         She must be about thirty-three, thirty-
                         four.

                                     GITTES
                         You must be thinking of a different 
                         daughter.

                                     PILOT
                         No, he's only got one, I remember 
                         her age, I read it in the newspapers 
                         when she ran away.

                                     GITTES
                         She ran away?

                                     PILOT
                         Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the 
                         time. Julian Cross' daughter. God 
                         almighty. She was a wild little thing.

               He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned 
               he's said too much.

                                     PILOT
                              (continuing)
                         Course, she settled down nicely.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling a little)
                         Well, you never know, do you?

                                     PILOT
                              (loosening up)
                         That's for sure.

                                     GITTES
                         Why'd she run away?

                                     PILOT
                         Oh, you know. She was sixteen or 
                         seventeen.

                                     GITTES
                              (nudging him)
                         We missed the best of it, didn't we, 
                         pal?

               Both men laugh a little lewdly.

                                     PILOT
                         She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she 
                         was knocked up and didn't even know 
                         who the father was. Went there to 
                         get rid of it.

                                     GITTES
                         You don't say?

                                     PILOT
                         Cross was looking for her all over 
                         the country. Offered rewards, 
                         everything. Felt real sorry for him, 
                         with all his money.

               ALBACORE CLUB  DAY

               A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building 
               on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A 
               motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns 
               and heads in the direction of the plane.

               EXT. WINDING ROAD  RANCHO DEL CRUCE

               Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign 
               with a cross painted below the name.

               The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island. 
               As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a 
               miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and 
               canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of 
               the sea.

               The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered 
               around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN 
               CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome 
               in a rough linen shirt and jeans. When he talks his strong 
               face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.

               EXT. BRIDLE PATH  GITTES & CROSS

               Walking toward the main house. A classic Monterey. A horse 
               led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates 
               in the center of the path they are taking. Gittes doesn't 
               notice.

                                     CROSS
                         Horseshit.

               Gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly.

                                     GITTES
                         Sir?

                                     CROSS
                         I said horseshit.
                              (pointing)
                         Horseshit.

                                     GITTES
                         Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. 
                         I'll give you that.

               Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes his 
               hat and waves it, inhales deeply.

                                     CROSS
                         Love the smell of it. A lot of people 
                         do but of course they won't admit 
                         it. Look at the shape.

               Gittes glances down out of politeness.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing; smiling, 
                              almost enthusiastic)
                         Always the same.

               Cross walks on. Gittes follows.

                                     GITTES
                              (not one to let it go)
                         Always?

                                     CROSS
                         What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the 
                         animal's sick or something.
                              (stops and glances. 
                              back)
                         And the steam rising off it like 
                         that in the morning. That's life, 
                         Mr. Gittes. Life.

               They move on.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Perhaps this preoccupation with 
                         horseshit may seem a little perverse, 
                         but I ask you to remember this. One 
                         way or another, it's what I've dealt 
                         in all my life. Let's have breakfast.

               EXT. COURTYARD VERANDA  GITTES & CROSS AT BREAKFAST

               Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by 
               one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick 
               up their heels.

               Cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to 
               time. An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main 
               course, broiled fish.

                                     CROSS
                         You know, you've got a nasty 
                         reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.

                                     GITTES
                              (dubious)
                         Thanks.

                                     CROSS
                         If you were a bank president that 
                         would be one thing, but in your 
                         business it's admirable. And it's 
                         good advertising.

                                     GITTES
                         It doesn't hurt.

                                     CROSS
                         It's why you attract a client like 
                         my daughter.

                                     GITTES
                         Probably.

                                     CROSS
                         But I'm surprised you're still working 
                         for her, unless she's suddenly come 
                         up with another husband.

                                     GITTES
                         No. She happens to think the last 
                         one was murdered.

               Cross is visibly surprised.

                                     CROSS
                         How did she get that idea?

                                     GITTES
                         I think I gave it to her.

               Cross nods.

                                     CROSS
                         Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I 
                         believe they should be served with 
                         the head.

               Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed 
               over with the heat of cooking.

                                     GITTES
                         Fine, as long as you don't serve 
                         chicken that way.

                                     CROSS
                              (laughs)
                         Tell me. What do the police say?

                                     GITTES
                         They're calling it an accident.

                                     CROSS
                         Who's the investigating officer?

                                     GITTES
                         Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.

                                     CROSS
                         Do you know him?

                                     GITTES
                         Oh yes.

                                     CROSS
                         Where from?

                                     GITTES
                         We worked in Chinatown together.

                                     CROSS
                         Would you call him a capable man?

                                     GITTES
                         Very.

                                     CROSS
                         Honest?

                                     GITTES
                         Far as it goes. Of course he has to 
                         swim in the same water we all do.

                                     CROSS
                         Of course, but you've got no reason 
                         to think he's bungled the case?

                                     GITTES
                         None.

                                     CROSS
                         That's too bad.

                                     GITTES
                         Too bad?

                                     CROSS
                         It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes 
                         me think you're taking my daughter 
                         for a ride. Financially speaking, of 
                         course. How much are you charging 
                         her?

                                     GITTES
                              (carefully)
                         My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come 
                         up with any results.

                                     CROSS
                         Are you sleeping with her? Come, 
                         come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to 
                         think about that to remember, do 
                         you?

               Gittes laughs.

                                     GITTES
                         If you want an answer to that question 
                         I can always put one of my men on 
                         the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.

                                     CROSS
                         Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a 
                         disturbed woman who's lost her 
                         husband. I don't want her taken 
                         advantage of. Sit down.

                                     GITTES
                         What for?

                                     CROSS
                         You may think you know what you're 
                         dealing with, but believe me, you 
                         don't.

               This stops Gittes. He seems faintly mused by it.

                                     CROSS
                         Why is that funny?

                                     GITTES
                         It's what the D.A. used to tell me 
                         about Chinatown.

                                     CROSS
                         Was he right?

               Gittes shrugs.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing)
                         ...Exactly what do you know about 
                         me, Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         Mainly that you're rich and too 
                         respectable to want your name in the 
                         papers.

                                     CROSS
                              (grunts, then)
                         'Course I'm respectable. I'm old.
                         Politicians, ugly buildings and whores 
                         all get respectable if they last 
                         long enough. I'll double whatever 
                         your fees are and I'll pay you ten 
                         thousand dollars if you can find 
                         Hollis' girlfriend.

                                     GITTES
                         His girlfriend?

                                     CROSS
                         Yes, his girlfriend.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean the little chippie he was 
                         with at the El Macando?

                                     CROSS
                         Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     CROSS
                         Doesn't that strike you as odd?

                                     GITTES
                         No. She's probably scared to death.

                                     CROSS
                         Wouldn't it be useful to talk to 
                         her?

                                     GITTES
                         Maybe.

                                     CROSS
                         If Mulwray was murdered, she was 
                         probably one of the last people to 
                         see him.

                                     GITTES
                         You didn't see Mulwray much, did 
                         you?

                                     CROSS
                         No.

                         When was the last time?

               Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI 
               BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred 
               yards off. They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. 
               For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along 
               in disordered review to the music.

                                     CROSS
                         Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of 
                         damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to 
                         the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em 
                         practice up out here.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Do you remember the last time 
                         you talked to Mulwray?

               Cross shakes his head.

                                     CROSS
                         At my age, you tend to lose track...

                                     GITTES
                         Well, It was about five days ago. 
                         You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle 
                         and you had one hell of an argument.

               Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         I've got the photographs in my office. 
                         If they'll help you remember. What 
                         was the argument about?

                                     CROSS
                              (a long pause, then:)
                         My daughter.

                                     GITTES
                         What about her?

                                     CROSS
                         Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I 
                         think she is frightened and I happen 
                         to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd 
                         like to help her if I can.

                                     GITTES
                         I didn't realize you and Hollis were 
                         so fond of each other.

               Cross looks hatefully at Gittes.

                                     CROSS
                         Hollis Mulwray made this city and he 
                         made me a fortune... We were a lot 
                         closer than Evelyn realized.

                                     GITTES
                         If you want to hire me, I still have 
                         to know what you and Mulwray were 
                         arguing about.

                                     CROSS
                              (painfully)
                         Well... she's an extremely jealous 
                         person. I didn't want her to find 
                         out about the girl.

                                     GITTES
                         How did you find out?

                                     CROSS
                         I've still got a few teeth in my 
                         head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends 
                         in town.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay. My secretary'll send you a 
                         letter of agreement. Tell me are you 
                         worried about that girl, or what 
                         Evelyn might do to her?

                                     CROSS
                         Just find the girl.

                         I'll look into it as soon as I check 
                         out some avocado groves.

                                     CROSS
                         Avocado groves?

                                     GITTES
                         We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

               INT. HALL OF RECORDS  DAY

               Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes 
               approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.

                                     GITTES
                         I'm a little lost. Where can I find 
                         the plat books for the northwest 
                         valley?

               The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little.

                                     CLERK
                         Part of it's in Ventura County. We 
                         don't have Ventura County in our 
                         Hall of Records.

               Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll settle for L.A. County.

                                     CLERK
                              (regards him, then)
                         Row twenty-three, section C.

               The Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back a 
               moment, then goes to the stacks.

               THROUGH THE STACKS

               Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The 
               second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment, 
               then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.

               He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's 
               huge and there's a lot to go through.

               The print itself makes him squint.

               INSERT PAGE

               Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS 
               designation where the description of the land parcel is long 
               and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 
               7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old 
               and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous 
               freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.

                                     GITTES
                         Hauls the huge volume back to the 
                         Clerk's desk.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Clerk)
                         Say... uh... sonny.

               The Clerk turns sharply around.

                                     GITTES
                         How come all these new names are 
                         pasted into the plat book?

                                     CLERK
                         Land sales out of escrow are always 
                         recorded within the week.

               Gittes looks a little surprised.

                                     GITTES
                         Then these are all new owners?

                                     CLERK
                         That's right.

                                     GITTES
                              (astonished)
                         But that means that most of the 
                         valley's been sold in the last few 
                         months.

                                     CLERK
                         If that's what it says.

                                     GITTES
                         Can I check one of these volumes 
                         out?

                                     CLERK
                              (quietly snotty)
                         Sir, this is not a lending library, 
                         it's the Hall of Records.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, then, how about a ruler?

                                     CLERK
                         A ruler?

                                     GITTES
                         The print's pretty fine. I forgot my 
                         glasses. I'd like to be able to read 
                         across.

               The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler 
               on the desk.

               Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the 
               book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.

               INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY

               Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward 
               the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a 
               strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and 
               property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or 
               coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.

               EXT. ROAD  GITTES DRIVING  DAY

               Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying 
               groves, narrower roads.

               He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There 
               is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks 
               it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.

               OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON

               And a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this 
               dried-up intersection. There is a "SOLD" sign on a drug store. 
               Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.

               Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud 
               of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.

               Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards 
               away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid 
               off it.

               Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.

               Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.

                                     GITTES
                              (to one of the Children)
                         Say, pal, what's he doing?

                                     CHILD
                         Making some rain.

               Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying 
               himself with the intricacies of his machine. He's aware of 
               Gittes watching him.

                                     GITTES
                         Well, you're just the man I'm looking 
                         for.

               The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is 
               immaculately dressed.

                                     GITTES
                         Some associates and I are thinking 
                         of buying property out here. Of 
                         course, we're worried about the 
                         rainfall.

               The Rainmaker steps down.

                         No problem with me on the Job.

                         Yeah.
                              (glancing around at 
                              the desolate, dry 
                              field)

                         City of La Habra Heights filled an

                         inches of rain in two days.

                         Never heard of 'em... new owners?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                         Lot of turnover these days. Better 
                         tell them to get in touch with me if 
                         they want to hang onto their land.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah, I'll do that.

               GITTES DRIVING

               Is now covered with a film of dust:

               He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple of 
               mailboxes.

               Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.

               As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be 
               SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado 
               and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures 
               in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down 
               to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. 
               Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.

               Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and 
               "KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed on it.

               He drives down the road into the grove.

               GITTES

               Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He 
               puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast 
               with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their 
               heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.

               Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of 
               the tree he'd been staring at.

               EXT. AVOCADO GROVES  DAY

               Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback 
               down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-
               Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does 
               not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes' 
               lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes 
               off down one of the orchard lanes.

               MOVING WITH GITTES

               The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a 
               Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.

               Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the 
               trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued 
               by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at 
               it.

               ANGLE ON GROVE

               Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes 
               toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted 
               it. Clearly it's from Gittes' car.

               This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one 
               on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and 
               across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator 
               are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.

               Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese 
               and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of 
               the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.

               Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches 
               over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of 
               the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle 
               with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back 
               with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to 
               the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues 
               to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.

               The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a 
               mule ride up.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         All right, quit it! Quit now! Search 
                         the man, see if he's armed.

               Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger 
               Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes 
               is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his 
               wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         I said see if he's armed, not empty 
                         his pockets.

                                     BIG FARMER
                         He ain't armed.

               Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         All right, mister. Who you with? 
                         Water department or the real estate 
                         office?

               Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble 
               catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in 
               the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Crippled Farmer)
                         Get away from me!

                                     CRIPPLED FARMER
                         Answer him!

                                     GITTES
                         Touch me with that thing again and 
                         you'll need a pair of them.

                                     BIG FARMER
                              (shoving Gittes)
                         Whyn't you pick on somebody your own 
                         size?

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         I said cut that out! Give him a chance 
                         to say something.

               Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer.

                                     GITTES
                              (reaching down for 
                              his wallet)
                         Name's Gittes. I'm a private 
                         investigator and I'm not with either 
                         one.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         Then what are you doing out here?

                                     GITTES
                         Client hired me to see... whether or 
                         not the water department's been 
                         irrigating your land.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         Irrigating my land?
                              (exploding)
                         The water department's been sending 
                         you people to blow up my water tanks! 
                         They threw poison down three of my 
                         wells! I call that a funny way to 
                         irrigate. Who'd hire you for a thing 
                         like that?

               Gittes reaches into his pocket. The paper's on the ground. 
               He picks it up.

                                     GITTES
                         Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

                                     BIG FARMER
                         Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch 
                         who's done it to us.

                                     GITTES
                         Mulwray's dead. You don't know what 
                         you're talking about, you dumb Oakie.

               The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him 
               squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled 
               up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful 
               aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. 
               Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the 
               Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.

                                     RED FACED FARMER
                         Well, that's that.

               BLACK SCREEN

               There's a PURLING SOUND, which soon becomes defined into the 
               SOUND OF VOICES talking quietly  about whether to move or 
               not to move, doctors, etc.

               CLOSE  EVELYN MULWRAY

               Is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened in 
               porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and 
               the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog.

               The Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out. The farmers, 
               all of them, now seem awkward and a little embarrassed.

               FRONT PORCH  RED FACE FARMER'S HOUSE  REACTION  GITTES  
               DUSK

               He focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him. He's got 
               dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge 
               mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of 
               spots.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Evelyn)
                         What's going on?

                                     DUBOIS
                              (quietly, almost as 
                              if he were in a 
                              hospital)
                         You didn't look too good, so we 
                         thought we better call your employer.

               Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It's almost 
               evening.

               Gittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS) 
               looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his 
               head, It obviously hurts him.

               EXT. DUBOIS FARMHOUSE  EVENING

               Evelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored 
               Packard.

               Dubois accompanies them, along with the Big Farmer who is 
               carrying a crate of something. Gittes has cleaned himself up 
               a little.

                                     DUBOIS
                         Look here, if it's all the same with 
                         you, we'll get your car patched up. 
                         If you'll tell me what your trousers 
                         run you, I'll make good on them, Mr. 
                         Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         It's okay, Mr. Dubois.

                                     DUBOIS,
                              (to Evelyn)
                         It's just that they're after everybody 
                         out here, tearing up our irrigation 
                         ditches trying to make our land 
                         worthless so they can pick it up for 
                         twenty-five dollars an acre.

               Gittes nods.

                                     DUBOIS
                              (continuing)
                         Anyway. Earl here is sorry, too. He 
                         wants to give you something to take 
                         back with you.

               Gittes looks. Earl has the huge crate he's holding brim-full 
               of avocados.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks, Earl.

               INT. CAR  EVELYN & GITTES  DUSK

               Evelyn driving.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks for coming...

               Gittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one, offers one to 
               Evelyn who refuses.

                                     GITTES
                         That dam is a con job.

                                     EVELYN
                         What dam?

                                     GITTES
                         The one your husband opposed. They're 
                         conning L.A. into building it, only 
                         the water won't go to L.A. It'll go 
                         here.

                                     EVELYN
                         The Valley?

                                     GITTES
                         Everything you can see, everything 
                         around us. I was at the Hall of 
                         Records today.
                              (whips out papers, 
                              turns on the car 
                              light)
                         That bother you?

                                     EVELYN
                         No.

                                     GITTES
                              (looking over papers)
                         In the last three months, Robert 
                         Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma 
                         Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 
                         5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 
                         25,000 acres.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jasper Lamar Crabb?

                                     GITTES
                         Know him?

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I think I'd remember.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. They've been blowing these 
                         farmers out of here and buying their 
                         land for peanuts. Have any idea what 
                         this land'll be worth with a steady 
                         water supply? About thirty million 
                         more than they paid.

                                     EVELYN
                         And Hollis knew about it?

                                     GITTES
                         It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar 
                         Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.

               He's pulling out his wallet, excitedly now, spilling its 
               contents onto the seat. He pulls out the obituary column 
               he'd folded up earlier in the day.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         We got it. We got it, baby.

                                     EVELYN
                         What? What is it?

                                     GITTES
                         There was a memorial service at the 
                         Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar 
                         Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

                                     EVELYN
                         Is that unusual?

                                     GITTES
                         Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 
                         acres. That's unusual.

               EXT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME  NIGHT

               Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home, 
               its entryway illuminated by streetlights. There is a small 
               sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll. It 
               sits on the rolling green lawns.

               Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn. He offers her his 
               arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance.

               INT. MAR VISTA INN AND REST HOME  NIGHT

               Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his 
               forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. He sees Evelyn 
               first.

                                     PALMER
                         Hello there, I'm Mr. Palmer. Can I 
                         help you folks?

               Then he gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, trousers torn, 
               etc.

                                     GITTES
                         Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad.
                              (indicating his 
                              disheveled appearance)
                         I just can't handle him anymore, can 
                         I, sweetheart?

               Evelyn shakes her head.

                                     PALMER
                         Oh my goodness.

                                     GITTES
                              (hastily)
                         Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, 
                         actually.

                                     EVELYN
                         They just don't get along very well. 
                         Dad's a lamb with anyone else.

                                     PALMER
                              (not so sure)
                         Oh, well, I don't know.

                                     GITTES
                         Naturally, I want the best for him, 
                         money is no object.

                                     PALMER
                         Perhaps if we could meet your father.

                                     GITTES
                         There's just one question.

                                     PALMER
                         Of course.

                                     GITTES
                         Do you accept anyone of the Jewish 
                         persuasion?

               Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question.

                                     PALMER
                              (very embarrassed)
                         I'm sorry. We don't.

                                     GITTES
                              (smoothly)
                         Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. 
                         Wanted to make sure though, didn't 
                         we, honey?

               Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled. She manages 
               to nod.

                                     GITTES
                         Just to be certain, I wonder if you 
                         could show us a list of your patients?

                                     PALMER
                              (polite but pointed)
                         We don't reveal the names of our 
                         guests as a matter of policy. I know 
                         you'd appreciate that if your father 
                         came to live with us.

               Gittes locks eyes with Palmer.

                                     GITTES
                              (confidentially)
                         That's exactly what we wanted to 
                         hear.

                                     PALMER
                         Oh, good.

                                     GITTES
                         I wonder, is it too late for us to 
                         have a look around?

                                     PALMER
                         I don't think so. Be happy to show 
                         you.

                                     GITTES
                         Would you mind if we took a stroll 
                         on our own?

                                     PALMER
                         Just, if you will, confine yourself 
                         to the main building. It's nearly 
                         bedtime.

                                     GITTES
                         We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.

               He takes Evelyn.

               INT. PARLOR  EVELYN

               Looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily 
               octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one wing, 
               the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one 
               elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.

               In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a 
               quilt.

               Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     GITTES
                              (quietly)
                         They're all here. Every goddam name.

               Gittes points to the wall. It says "ACTIVITIES BOARD". There 
               are titles. "LAWN BOWLING". "BRIDGE". "FISHING". "CROQUET". 
               Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain 
               activities, for certain days.

               After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing; indicating 
                              the ancients around 
                              them)
                         You're looking at the owners of a 
                         50,000 acre empire.

                                     EVELYN
                              (astonished)
                         They can't be.

                                     GITTES
                         They may not know it but they are.

               Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the 
               quilt.

                                     GITTES
                         Hello, girls.

               Two of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy herself 
               with her quilt, off by herself.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Which one of you is Emma Dill?

               Two of them say "she is," and point in different directions. 
               The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her 
               knitting. Gittes approaches her.

                                     GITTES
                         Are you Emma?

               Some old voice is singing softly, "Don't Sit Under the Apple 
               Tree."

                                     EMMA
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                         I've been wanting to meet you.

                                     EMMA
                         Why?

                                     GITTES
                         Did you know that you're a very 
                         wealthy woman?

                                     EMMA
                              (stitching, smiles)
                         I'm not.

                                     GITTES
                         Well you own a lot of land.

                                     EMMA
                         Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my 
                         late husband owned a good deal of 
                         beach property in Long Beach, but we 
                         lost it.

               Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among 
               the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it.

                                     GITTES
                         That's just lovely.

                                     EMMA
                         Thank you...

               He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, 
               comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C.

                                     GITTES
                              (indicating tail)
                         Where did you get this material?

                                     EMMA
                              (what it sounds like)
                         The apple core club.

                                     GITTES
                         The apple core?

                                     EMMA
                         No. The albacore. It's a fish. My 
                         grandson's a member and they take 
                         very nice care of us.

                                     GITTES
                         How do they do that?

                                     EMMA
                         Give us things. Not just some old 
                         flag like this, but -

                                     GITTES
                              (kneeling)
                         But what?

                                     PALMER'S VOICE
                         We're a sort of unofficial charity 
                         of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you 
                         care to come this way? Someone wants 
                         to see you.

               Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking 
               taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures 
               as if there's someone behind Palmer.

               Gittes rises.

                                     GITTES
                         See you later, Emma.

               He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front.

               AT THE ENTRANCE HALL  MULVIHILL

               Is waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to 
               Gittes.

               The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over 
               everyone.

                                     MULVIHILL
                         Come on I want you to meet somebody, 
                         Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (glancing from Palmer 
                              to Mulvihill)
                         Can we leave the lady out of this?

                                     MULVIHILL
                              (a little uncertain)
                         Yeah, why not?

                                     GITTES
                         Okay, I'd like to walk her to her 
                         car.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'll stay.

                                     GITTES
                              (taking her by the 
                              arm)
                         Get in the car.

                                     MULVIHILL
                         I'll see she makes it.

               Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake 
               of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back 
               to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's 
               jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket 
               covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating 
               him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly 
               pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red 
               and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.

               Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's 
               gun has clattered to the floor.

                                     GITTES
                              (as Mulvihill hits 
                              the floor, to Evelyn)
                         What are you waiting for? Get in the 
                         car!

               Evelyn goes.

               Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the 
               gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand 
               and kicks it.

               It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the 
               wall.

               Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back 
               to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.

               Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience 
               of ancients behind him.

               OUTSIDE

               As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming 
               toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, 
               jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.

               Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward 
               him.

               Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.

               Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly 
               behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across 
               the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it 
               gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety. 
               The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.

               Evelyn opens the passenger door.

                                     EVELYN
                         Get in.

               Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting 
               the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Two 
               SHOTS ARE FIRED.

               INT. CAR  EVELYN & GITTES

               Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she 
               takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little. 
               Gittes watches her. He smiles.

               EXT. VERANDA  MULWRAY HOME  NIGHT

               Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring 
               off into the night.

               Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey 
               and an ice bucket on it. She sets it down. Gittes turns.

                                     GITTES
                              (watching her pour)
                         Maid's night off?

                                     EVELYN
                         Why?

                                     GITTES
                              (a little surprised, 
                              he laughs)
                         What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's 
                         here, that's all.

                                     EVELYN
                              (handing Gittes his 
                              drink)
                         I gave everybody the night off.

                                     GITTES
                         Easy, it's an innocent question.

                                     EVELYN
                         No question from you is innocent, 
                         Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (laughing)
                         I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. 
                         Frankly you really saved my a... my 
                         neck tonight.

               They drink.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell me something. Does this usually 
                         happen to you, Mr. Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well, I'm only judging on the basis 
                         of one afternoon and an evening, but 
                         if that's how you go about your work, 
                         I'd say you're lucky to get through 
                         a whole day.

                                     GITTES
                              (pouring himself 
                              another drink)
                         Actually this hasn't happened to me 
                         in some time.

                                     EVELYN
                         When was the last time?

                                     GITTES
                         Why?

                                     EVELYN
                         Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.

               Gittes touches his nose, winces a little.

                                     GITTES
                         It was in Chinatown.

                                     EVELYN
                         What were you doing there?

                                     GITTES
                              (taking a long drink)
                         Working for the District Attorney.

                                     EVELYN
                         Doing what?

               Gittes looks sharply at her. Then:

                                     GITTES
                         As little as possible.

                                     EVELYN
                         The District Attorney gives his men 
                         advice like that?

                                     GITTES
                         They do in Chinatown.

               She looks at him. Gittes stares off into the night.

               Evelyn has poured herself another drink.

                                     EVELYN
                         Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't 
                         it?

               Gittes gets up.

                                     GITTES
                         No. I wonder... could I. Do you have 
                         any peroxide or something?

               He touches his nose lightly.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh sure. C'mon.

               She takes his hand and leads him back into the house.

               INT. BATHROOM  MIRROR

               Gittes pulls the plaster off his nose, stares at it in the 
               mirror.

               Evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some cotton out of a 
               medicine cabinet. Evelyn turns Gittes' head toward her. She 
               has him sit on the pullman tile adjacent to the sink.

                                     EVELYN
                         Doctor did a nice job...

               She begins to work on his nose with the peroxide. Then she 
               sees his cheek, checks back in his hair.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing)
                         Boy oh boy, you're a mess.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     EVELYN
                              (working on him)
                         So why does it bother you to talk 
                         about it... Chinatown...

                                     GITTES
                         Bothers everybody who works there, 
                         but to me... It was...

               Gittes shrugs.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hold still. Why?

                                     GITTES
                         You can't always tell what's going 
                         on there.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...No. Why was it.

                                     GITTES
                         I thought I was keeping someone from 
                         being hurt and actually I ended up 
                         making sure they were hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you do anything about it?

               They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near 
               his eye.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself 
                         in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second.

               He takes hold of her and pulls her even closer,

                                     EVELYN
                              (momentarily freezing)
                         What's wrong?

                                     GITTES
                         Your eye.

                                     EVELYN
                         What about it?

                                     GITTES
                              (staring intently)
                         There's something black in the green 
                         part of your eye.

                                     EVELYN
                              (not moving)
                         Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...

                                     GITTES
                         ...A flaw...

                                     EVELYN
                              (she almost shivers)
                         ...Yes, sort of a birthmark...

               Gittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's standing 
               holding her. She hesitates, then wraps her arms around him.

               INT. MULWRAY BEDROOM  TELEPHONE

               On a nightstand, city lights visible through the open window 
               behind it. It is RINGING. Evelyn's arm reaches INTO SHOT. 
               SOUND of something hitting the headboard. Gittes moans.

               VIEW SHIFTS TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, holding his head, which 
               he's just hit. Evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone. She 
               turns to him, whispers, "I'm sorry," kisses him on the head 
               and lips. PHONE CONTINUES TO RING. She picks it up.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello...
                              (in Spanish now)
                         No, no, I'll come and help, just 
                         keep watching her and don't do 
                         anything until I get there... 'bye.

               VIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn 
               next to him as she's talking on the phone. She hangs up. She 
               touches Gittes' cheek lightly.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have to go.

               Gittes stares at her silently.

                                     GITTES
                         Where?

                                     EVELYN
                         Just... I have to.

                                     GITTES
                         And I want to know where.

                                     EVELYN
                              (she starts out of 
                              bed)
                         Please don't be angry... believe me, 
                         it's got nothing to do with you.

                                     GITTES
                              (stopping her)
                         Where are you going?

                                     EVELYN
                              (near tears)
                         Please!... Trust me this much...
                              (she kisses him lightly)
                         I'll be back. Look, there is something 
                         I should tell you. The fishing club 
                         that old lady mentioned, the pieces 
                         off the flag.

                                     GITTES
                         The Albacore Club.

                                     EVELYN
                         It has to do with my father.

                                     GITTES
                         I know.

                                     EVELYN
                         He owns it. You know?

                                     GITTES
                         I saw him.

                                     EVELYN
                              (sitting up straight)
                         You saw my fa... father? When?

                                     GITTES
                         This morning.

                                     EVELYN
                              (panicked)
                         You didn't tell me.

                                     GITTES
                         There hasn't been a lot of time.

               She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did he say?
                              (insistent)
                         What did he say?

                                     GITTES
                         That you were jealous, and he was 
                         worried about what you might do.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do? To who?

                                     GITTES
                         Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. 
                         He wanted to know where she was.

               Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and 
               kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         I want you to listen to me. My father 
                         is a very dangerous man. You don't 
                         know how dangerous. You don't know 
                         how crazy.

                                     GITTES
                         Give me an example.

                                     EVELYN
                         You may think you know what's going 
                         on, but you don't.

                                     GITTES
                         That's what your father said. You're 
                         telling me he's in back of this whole 
                         thing?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's possible.

                                     GITTES
                         Including the death of your husband?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's possible. Please don't ask me 
                         any more questions now. Just wait, 
                         wait for me. I'll be back. I need 
                         you here.

               She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes 
               stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, 
               tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on. 
               Then hurries out of the bedroom.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  GITTES

               Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two 
               cars there.

               Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard.

               Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door.

               INT. BUICK - GITTES

               Checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple of 
               wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems 
               satisfied.

               Slides out across the seat, slams the door.

               EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY  NIGHT

               Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the 
               driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the heel 
               of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the 
               car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls 
               the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light 
               beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and 
               hurries back toward the house.

               ONE RED AND ONE WHITE TAILLIGHT  MOVING  NIGHT

               Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, 
               the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.

               GITTES DRIVING  NIGHT

               Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance 
               from Evelyn in front of him.

               EVELYN'S PACKARD

               Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She gets out, 
               looks up and down the street. There is nothing. She hurries 
               on up the walkway to the front door.

               DOWN THE STREET  GITTES IN BUICK

               Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a 
               few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's.

               Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The 
               curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on 
               the side of the house.

               He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.

               THROUGH THE WINDOW

               Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living 
               room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back 
               through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and 
               pitcher on it.

               GITTES

               Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and 
               a short picket fence.

               He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series 
               of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades 
               on them.

               He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking 
               alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the 
               windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not 
               completely drawn.

               There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.

               THROUGH THE WINDOW

               Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and 
               forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone 
               rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure 
               is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes 
               INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen 
               with Hollis Mulwray.

               Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking 
               in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is 
               bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.

               Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some 
               pills.

               The girl reluctantly does.

               GITTES

               Continues to watch.

               EXT. STREET  EVELYN  NIGHT

               Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in.

               INT. CAR

               Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at 
               her.

                                     GITTES
                         Okay, give me the keys.

                                     EVELYN
                              (stunned, furious)
                         You bastard.

                                     GITTES
                         It's either that or you drive to the 
                         police yourself.

                                     EVELYN
                         The police?

                                     GITTES
                         C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your 
                         husband's girlfriend tied up in there!

                                     EVELYN
                         She's not tied up!

                                     GITTES
                         You know what I mean. You're keeping 
                         her there against her will.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am not!

                                     GITTES
                         Then let's go talk to her.

               Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, 
               nearly screaming:

                                     EVELYN
                         No!

               Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn 
               jacket.

               He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming 
               effect on both of them.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing)
                         She's too upset.

                                     GITTES
                         What about?

                                     EVELYN
                         Hollis' death. I tried to keep it 
                         from her, I didn't want her upset 
                         before I could make plans for her to 
                         leave.

                                     GITTES
                         You mean she just found out?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     GITTES
                         That's not what it looks like, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.

                                     EVELYN
                         What does it look like?

                                     GITTES
                         Like she knows about Hollis' death. 
                         Like she knows more than you want 
                         her to tell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You're insane.

               Gittes explodes.

                                     GITTES
                         Just tell me the truth. I'm not the 
                         police. I don't care what you've 
                         done. I'm not going to hurt you, but 
                         one way or another I'm going to know.

                                     EVELYN
                         You won't go to the police if I tell 
                         you?

                                     GITTES
                         I will if you don't.

               A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, 
               her hair covering her face.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my sister.

               Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the 
               kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes 
               puts an arm on her shoulder.

                                     GITTES
                         Take it easy... If it's your sister 
                         it's your sister... why all the 
                         secrecy?

               She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely 
               puzzled.

                                     EVELYN
                              (really upset)
                         I can't...

                                     GITTES
                         Because of Hollis? Because she was 
                         seeing your husband? Was that it? 
                         Jesus Christ, say something. Was 
                         that it?

               She nods. Gittes sighs.

                                     EVELYN
                              (finally)
                         I would never ever have harmed Hollis. 
                         I loved him more than my own family. 
                         He was the most gentle, decent man 
                         imaginable... and he put up with 
                         more from me than you'll ever know... 
                         I just wanted him to be happy...

               She begins to cry softly.

                                     GITTES
                              (after a moment)
                         I took your husband's Buick...
                              (he opens the car 
                              door)
                         I'll return it tomorrow.

                                     EVELYN
                         Aren't you coming back with me?

                                     GITTES
                         Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody 
                         about this.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...That's not what I meant.

               There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to 
               Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.

                                     GITTES
                              (finally)
                         Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray. Good night.

               He gets out and slams the car door. She drives off.

               INT. SHOWER  GITTES' APARTMENT  GITTES

               The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes 
               is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as 
               the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly 
               for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it.

               INT. GITTES' BEDROOM  GITTES

               Pads around in elegant silk pajamas.

               He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming 
               in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of 
               the covers, inert. Almost immediately the PHONE RINGS. Gittes 
               lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying 
               anything.

               Gittes slowly rises to one elbow.

                         wants to see me she can call me at 
                         my office.

               He hangs up, falls back down. PHONE RINGS AGAIN. AND AGAIN. 
               Gittes swears, picks it up.

               Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.

               EXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD  HOLLYWOOD HILLS  EARLY MORNING

               Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow 
               walkway and sickly green stucco.

               EXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT  DAY

               Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. 
               Nothing. He opens it and enters.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust 
               particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes 
               sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone 
               table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets 
               closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside 
               the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. 
               Gittes walks on into the kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying 
               on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a 
               broken bag.

               Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream 
               of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. 
               She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.

               Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes 
               for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen 
               counter.

               Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her 
               name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, 
               carefully replaces the items in the purse.

               He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, 
               which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves 
               across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Gittes enters and turns on the light.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Find anything interesting, Gittes?

               Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom 
               by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A 
               THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom.

               Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         What are you doing here?

                                     GITTES
                         Didn't you call?

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (jerk of his head 
                              toward the kitchen)
                         How do you happen to know her?

                                     GITTES
                         I don't.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (turning toward other 
                              room)
                         Let me show you something.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Escobar points to the number "MU 7279" on the side of one of 
               the kitchen cabinets.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Isn't that your number?

                                     GITTES
                         Is it? I forget. I don't call myself 
                         that often.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Just to be on the safe side, we had 
                         Loach here give you a ring.

               He indicates one of his assistants.

                                     ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT
                              (a slight sneer)
                         What happened to your nose, Gittes? 
                         Somebody slam a bedroom window on 
                         it?

                                     GITTES
                              (right back, smiling)
                         Nope, your wife got excited, crossed 
                         her legs a little too quick. You 
                         understand, pal.

               The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for 
               him.

               Escobar steps between the two.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to other Assistant)
                         Loach.
                              (Escobar pulls out a 
                              drawer)
                         How about these? Look familiar?

               In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in 
               the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda.

                                     GITTES
                              (no point in denying 
                              it)
                         Yeah, I took 'em. So what?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         How did she...
                              (meaning the corpse)
                         ...happen to have them?

               Gittes takes a deep breath.

                                     GITTES
                         Either you tell me or I guess 'cause 
                         I don't have the answer.

               Escobar nods.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You really think I'm stupid, don't 
                         you, Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                         I don't think about it one way or 
                         the other. But if you want, give me 
                         a day or two, and I'll get back to 
                         you. Now I'd like to go home.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I want the rest of the pictures.

                                     GITTES
                         What pictures?

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (meaning the corpse)
                         This broad hired you, Gittes, not 
                         Evelyn Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down 
                         Mulwray, she hired you, and that's 
                         how you happen to know Mulwray was 
                         murdered.

                                     GITTES
                         I heard it was an accident.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         C'mon, you think you're dealing with 
                         a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had 
                         salt water in his goddam lungs! Now 
                         how did he get that... in a fresh 
                         water reservoir?

               Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains 
               nonplussed.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You were following him night and 
                         day. You saw who killed him. You 
                         even took pictures of it. It was 
                         Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying 
                         you off like a slot machine ever 
                         since her husband died.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling)
                         You accusing me of extortion?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Absolutely.

                                     GITTES
                         I don't think I need a day or two. 
                         You're even dumber than you think I 
                         think you are. Not only that, I'd 
                         never extort a nickel out of my worst 
                         enemy, that's where I draw the line, 
                         Escobar.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Yeah, I once knew a whore who for 
                         enough money would piss in a 
                         customer's face, but she'd never 
                         shit on his chest. That's where she 
                         drew the line.

                                     GITTES
                              (smiling)
                         Well, I hope she wasn't too much of 
                         a disappointment to you, Lou.

               Escobar manages a thin smile.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I want those photographs, Gittes. 
                         We're talking about accessory after 
                         the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. 
                         Minimum.

                                     GITTES
                         Why do you think Mulwray's body was 
                         moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray 
                         knocked off her husband in the ocean 
                         and thought it would look like more 
                         of an accident if she hauled him up 
                         to the Oak Pass Reservoir?

               This is a little telling.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Mulwray was murdered and moved because 
                         somebody didn't want his body found 
                         in the ocean.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         And why's that?

                                     GITTES
                         He found out somebody was dumping 
                         water there. That's what they were 
                         trying to cover up by moving him.

               This stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         What are you talking about?

                                     GITTES
                         C'mon I'll show you.

               Escobar hesitates.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're 
                         in charge.

               The men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods.

               CLOSE SHOT  STORM DRAIN

               It yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into 
               the ocean.

               VIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain 
               clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if 
               they expect it to talk.

                                     GITTES
                              (squinting in sunlight)
                         It's too late.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Too late for what?

                                     GITTES
                         They only dump the water at night.

               A THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and Over 
               to Escobar.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Reach anybody?

                                     THIRD ASSISTANT
                         Yelburton, he's the new chief.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I know who he is. Well?

                                     THIRD ASSISTANT
                         He says -

                                     GITTES
                         I know what he says.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to Gittes)
                         Shut up.
                              (to Assistant)
                         Go on.

                                     THIRD ASSISTANT
                         Yelburton says they're irrigating in 
                         the valley. There's always a little 
                         runoff when they do that. And he 
                         says is Gittes knows that, and has 
                         been going around making irresponsible 
                         accusations for the last week.

               Escobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment.

                                     ONE OF ASSISTANTS
                         Let's swear out a warrant for her 
                         arrest. What are we waiting for?

                                     GITTES
                              (meaning Escobar)
                         Because he just made lieutenant, and 
                         he wants to hang onto his little 
                         gold bar.

               Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Have your client in my office in two 
                         hours and remember. I don't have to 
                         let you go. I've got you for 
                         withholding evidence right now.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  DAY

               Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks 
               in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's 
               truck is there.

               Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He 
               rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries 
               it. It's locked.

               He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, 
               takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the 
               lock.

               The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at 
               Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

                                     MAID
                         No esta.

               Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room 
               where luggage is packed and neatly piled.

               The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over 
               the furniture.

                                     GITTES
                              (indicating luggage)
                         Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...
                              (no answer)
                         on a trip?... vacation?...

                                     MAID
                         No esta in casa.

               Gittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to 
               the veranda.

               EXT. MULWRAY VERANDA  GITTES

               Is unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He 
               wanders a few yards in that direction.

               GARDENER

               Spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles.

               GITTES

               In turn, nods, smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         Bad for glass.

               GARDENER

               Breaks into a big grin. Nods again.

                                     GARDENER
                         Oh yes, bad for glass.

               He points to the newly mown lawn.

                                     GARDENER
                              (continuing)
                         Salt water velly bad for glass.

                                     GITTES
                         Can't quite believe what he's heard,

                                     GITTES
                         Salt water?

               The Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond.

                                     GARDENER
                         Velly velly bad.

               Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the 
               edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd 
               looked closely, a starfish.

               CLOSE STARFISH

               It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just 
               beginning to grow back.

               GITTES

               Touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots 
               something glinting in the bottom of the pond.

                                     GITTES
                         What's that... down there?

               The Gardener peers into the pond.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         ...there.

               The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the 
               pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching 
               the water.

               He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an 
               animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and 
               holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking 
               through the frame where one lens is shattered.

               The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. 
               They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.

               INT. MULWRAY HOME

               Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table, 
               lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.

               The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily 
               watching him.

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         Hello.

                                     GITTES
                         Have you got your checkbook handy, 
                         Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         You've got her? Where?

                                     GITTES
                         Do you remember the figures we 
                         discussed?

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         Of course I do. Where are you?

                                     GITTES
                         At your daughter's house. How soon 
                         can you get here?

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be 
                         there as well?

                                     GITTES
                         Either that or she'll be in jail.

                                     CROSS' VOICE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     GITTES
                         Just bring your checkbook.

               Gittes hangs up.

               EXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE  ADELAIDE DRIVE

               Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the front 
               door, pounds on it.

               The Chinese servant answers the door.

                                     CHINESE SERVANT
                         You wait.

                                     GITTES
                              (short sentence in 
                              Chinese)
                         You wait.

               Gittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but 
               glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' arm.

                                     EVELYN
                         How are you? I was calling you.

               She looks at him, searching his face.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah?

               They move into the living room. Gittes is looking around it.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did you get some sleep?

                                     GITTES
                         Sure.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you 
                         something.

                                     GITTES
                              (abruptly)
                         Where's the girl?

                                     EVELYN
                         Upstairs. Why?

                                     GITTES
                         I want to see her.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...she's having a bath now... why do 
                         you want to see her?

               Gittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out 
               for packing in a bedroom off the living room.

                                     GITTES
                         Going somewhere?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. 
                         Why?

               Gittes doesn't answer. He goes to the phone and dials.

                                     GITTES
                         J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing? What's wrong? I 
                         told you we've got a 4:30.

                                     GITTES
                              (cutting her off)
                         You're going to miss your train!
                              (then, into phone)
                         Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's 
                         above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, 
                         soon as you can.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you do that for?

                                     GITTES
                              (a moment, then)
                         You know any good criminal lawyers?

                                     EVELYN
                              (puzzled)
                         No...

                                     GITTES
                         Don't worry. I can recommend a couple.
                         They're expensive but you can afford 
                         it.

                                     EVELYN
                              (evenly but with great 
                              anger)
                         What the hell is this all about?

               Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his 
               breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the 
               bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly 
               at them.

                                     GITTES
                         I found these in your backyard... in 
                         your fish pond. They belonged to 
                         your husband, didn't they?... didn't 
                         they?

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

                                     GITTES
                         Yes positively. That's where he was 
                         drowned...

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you saying?

                                     GITTES
                         There's no time for you to be shocked 
                         by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The 
                         coroner's report proves he was killed 
                         in salt water. Just take my word for 
                         it. Now I want to know how it happened 
                         and why. I want to know before Escobar 
                         gets here because I want to hang 
                         onto my license.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. This is the most insane... 
                         the craziest thing I ever...

               Gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself. gets up, 
               shakes her.

                                     GITTES
                         Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You 
                         were jealous, you fought, he fell, 
                         hit his head. It was an accident, 
                         but his girl is a witness. You've 
                         had to pay her off. You don't have 
                         the stomach to harm her, but you've 
                         got the money to shut her up. Yes or 
                         no?

                                     EVELYN
                         ...no...

                                     GITTES
                         Who is she? And don't give me that 
                         crap about it being your sister. You 
                         don't have a sister.

               Evelyn is trembling.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'll tell you the truth...

               Gittes smiles.

                                     GITTES
                         That's good. Now what's her name?

                                     EVELYN
                         Katherine.

                                     GITTES
                         Katherine?... Katherine who?

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my daughter.

               Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when 
               Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face. 
               Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from 
               her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.

                                     GITTES
                         I said the truth!

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my sister.

               Gittes slaps her again.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's my daughter.

               Gittes slaps her again.

                                     EVELYN
                         My sister.

               He hits her again.

                                     EVELYN
                         My daughter, my sister.

               He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase 
               which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing.

                                     GITTES
                         I said I want the truth.

                                     EVELYN
                              (almost screaming it)
                         She's my sister and my daughter!

               Kyo comes running down the stairs.

                                     EVELYN
                              (continuing; in Chinese)
                         For God's sake, Kyo, keep her 
                         upstairs, go back!

               Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes 
               back upstairs.

                                     EVELYN
                         My father and I, understand, or is 
                         it too tough for you?

               Gittes doesn't answer.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...he had a breakdown... the dam 
                         broke... my mother died... he became 
                         a little boy... I was fifteen... 
                         he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, 
                         what clothes to wear!... It 
                         happened... then I ran away...

                                     GITTES
                         To Mexico...

               She nods.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hollis came and took... care of me... 
                         after she was born... he said... he 
                         took care of her... I couldn't see 
                         her... I wanted to but I couldn't...  
                         I just want to see her once in a 
                         while... take care of her... that's 
                         all...  but I don't want her to 
                         know... I don't want her to know...

                                     GITTES
                         ...so that's why you hate him...

               Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... for turning his back on me 
                         after it happened! He couldn't face 
                         it...
                              (weeping)
                         I hate him.

               Gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie.

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah... where are you taking her 
                         now?

                                     EVELYN
                         Back to Mexico.

                                     GITTES
                         You can't go by train. Escobar'll be 
                         looking for you everywhere.

                                     EVELYN
                         How about a plane?

                                     GITTES
                         That's worse... Just get out of here. 
                         Walk out, leave everything.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have to go home and get my things.

                                     GITTES
                         I'll take care of it.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where can we go?

                                     GITTES
                         ...where does Kyo live?

                                     EVELYN
                         With us.

                                     GITTES
                         On his day off. Get the exact address.

                                     EVELYN
                         Okay...

               She stops suddenly.

                                     EVELYN
                         Those didn't belong to Hollis.

               For a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking about. 
               Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his 
               handkerchief.

                                     GITTES
                         How do you know?

                                     EVELYN
                         He didn't wear bifocals.

               Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is 
               momentarily lost in them.

               EVELYN

               From the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine.

                                     EVELYN
                         Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (from the stairs)
                         Hello.

                                     GITTES
                         Rises a little shakily from the arm 
                         of the sofa.

                                     GITTES
                         Hello.

               With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn 
               hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges.

                                     EVELYN
                              (calling down)
                         He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you 
                         know where that is?

               REACTION  GITTES

               He nods slowly.

                                     GITTES
                         Sure. It's Chinatown.

               THRU WINDOW

               Of bungalow Gittes watches Evelyn, the girl and Kyo head for 
               Kyo's black dusty sedan.

               Gittes drops the curtain, heads swiftly to the phone. He 
               dials.

                                     GITTES
                         Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, 
                         listen, pal, Escobar's going to try 
                         and book me in about five minutes... 
                         relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the 
                         office for two hours. If you don't 
                         hear from me, you and Duffy meet me 
                         at 1712 Alameda.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't 
                         it?

               The front BELL RINGS.

                                     GITTES
                         I know where it is! Just do it.

               Gittes hangs up and goes to the door. He opens it. No one is 
               there.

                                     GITTES
                              (not even bothering 
                              to look around the 
                              sides)
                         Come on in, Lou. We're both too late.

               Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door.

                                     GITTES
                         Looks like she flew the coop.

               Escobar nods.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I don't suppose you got any idea 
                         Where she went?

                                     GITTES
                         Matter of fact I do.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Where?

                                     GITTES
                         Her maid's house. I think she knows 
                         something's up.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         What's the maid's address?

                                     GITTES
                         She lives in Pedro. I'll write it 
                         down for you.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         No, Gittes, you'll show us.

                                     GITTES
                         What for?

                                     ESCOBAR
                         If she's not there, you're going 
                         downtown, and you're staying there 
                         til she shows up.

                                     GITTES
                              (deliberately petulant)
                         Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (shoving him toward 
                              the door)
                         Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.

               EXT. SAN PEDRO  29TH STREET  DAY

               A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar's unmarked 
               car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched 
               on the steep hillside.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         That's it?

                                     GITTES
                         Yeah.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Well, let's go.

                                     GITTES
                         Do me a favor, will you, Lou?

               Escobar waits.

                                     GITTES
                              (continuing)
                         Let me bring her down myself... she's 
                         not armed or nothing... she won't be 
                         any problem... I'd just like a minute 
                         alone with her... It would mean 
                         something... to...  her... and to 
                         me.

               Escobar shakes his head. For a moment it looks like it means 
               no.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         You never learn, do you, Gittes?

                                     GITTES
                              (a little chagrined)
                         I guess not.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Give you three minutes.

                                     GITTES
                         Gee, thanks, Lou.

               Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the 
               stairs. He looks back down at Escobar. Gittes rings the bell. 
               He waits. It opens. It's a WOMAN who's not recognizable. 
               She's got the remnants of a black eye.

                                     WOMAN
                         Yes?...

               Gittes looks past her to Curly, the fisherman from the first 
               scene.

               He's seated at the dinner table with his father, his mother, 
               and his children. Curly looks up in surprise.

                                     CURLY
                              (happily)
                         Mr. Gittes! Come in, come in.

               Gittes enters and closes the door. Curly rises and comes 
               over to him, greets him happily.

                                     CURLY
                         Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Call me Jake. How is everything?

                                     CURLY
                         Just sitting down to supper, Jake. 
                         Care to join us?

                                     GITTES
                         No thanks.

                         How about a glass of wine? Honey, 
                         this is...

                                     WIFE
                              (coolly)
                         Yes, I know.

                                     GITTES
                         Thanks just the same, Curly. I could 
                         use a glass of water, though. Come 
                         out with me to the kitchen for a 
                         second.

                                     CURLY
                              (puzzled)
                         Sure thing.

               INT. KITCHEN  GITTES AND CURLY

                                     GITTES
                         Curly, where's your car?

                                     CURLY
                         In the garage.

                                     GITTES
                         Where's that?

                                     CURLY
                         Off the alley.

                                     GITTES
                         Could you drive me somewhere?

                                     CURLY
                         Sure, as soon as we eat.

                                     GITTES
                         Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

                                     CURLY
                         I'll just tell my wife.

                                     GITTES
                              (pulling him out the 
                              back door)
                         Tell her later.

               They head out the back door and down the steps toward the 
               garage.

               EXT. ALLEY AND GARAGE

               Curly pulls open the garage door. Gets in, starts the car, 
               backs it out. It's an old, late twenties Plymouth Sedan. 
               Gittes hops in. They take off. At the edge of the alley Gittes 
               looks back.

               POV FROM CURLY'S CAR

               Escobar is getting out of his car, moving towards the duplex. 
               Gittes slips down in the seat.

                                     GITTES' VOICE
                         Just drive slow for a block or two, 
                         will you, Curly?

                                     CURLY'S VOICE
                         What's this all about?

                                     GITTES' VOICE
                         Tell you in a couple of blocks.

               INT. SEDAN  GITTES AND CURLY

                                     GITTES
                         How much do you owe me, Curly?

                                     CURLY
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out 
                         tomorrow. I know you been real good 
                         about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

                                     GITTES
                         Forget it. How would you like to pay 
                         me off by taking a couple of 
                         passengers to Ensenada... you'd have 
                         to leave tonight.

                                     CURLY
                         I don't know...

                                     GITTES
                         I might be able to squeeze an extra 
                         seventy-five bucks out of it for 
                         you. Maybe an even hundred.

                                     CURLY
                         Plus what I owe you?

                                     GITTES
                         I'll throw that in too.

                                     CURLY
                              (smiling)
                         Okay, you got yourself a boat.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  GITTES AND CURLY

               Carry bags out to Curly's car. Curly opens the door for the 
               Maid.

               She gets in. He turns to Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                         Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half 
                         an hour after you get there. Then if 
                         I don't show, take her down to the 
                         boat.

                                     CURLY
                              (a little worried)
                         You sure this is okay?

                                     GITTES
                              (mildly indignant)
                         Curly, you know how long I been in 
                         business.

               Curly nods, reassured. He gets in and takes off.

               EXT. MULWRAY HOME  DUSK

               By the pond, cigarette smoke drifts INTO SHOT. A car pulls 
               up. In a moment Cross can be SEEN, looking TOWARD CAMERA.

                                     CROSS
                         There you are.

               He walks toward Gittes who stands by the pond, smoking.

                                     CROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Well, you don't look any the worse 
                         for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... 
                         where's the girl?...

                                     GITTES
                         I've got her.

                                     CROSS
                         Is she all right?

                                     GITTES
                         She's fine.

                                     CROSS
                         Where is she?

                                     GITTES
                         With her mother.

               Cross' tone alters here.

                                     CROSS
                         ...with her mother?

               Gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it.

                                     GITTES
                         I'd like you to look at something, 
                         Mr. Cross.

                                     CROSS
                              (taking it)
                         What is it?

                                     GITTES
                         An obituary column... can you read 
                         in this light?

                                     CROSS
                         Yes... I think I can manage...

               Cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of 
               rimless glasses.. He puts them on, reads.

               GITTES

               Stares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look 
               through the obituary column. He looks up.

                                     CROSS
                         What does this mean?

                                     GITTES
                         That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

               Gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now.

                                     GITTES
                         Right here, in this pond. You drowned 
                         him...  and you left these.

               Cross looks at the glasses.

                                     GITTES
                         ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray 
                         had salt water in his lungs.

                                     CROSS
                              (finally)
                         Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. 
                         You know what he used to say about 
                         them?

                                     GITTES
                         Haven't the faintest idea.

                                     CROSS
                         That's where life begins... marshes, 
                         sloughs, tide-pools... he was 
                         fascinated by them...  you know when 
                         we first came out here he figured 
                         that if you dumped water onto desert 
                         sand it would percolate down into 
                         the bedrock and stay there, instead 
                         of evaporating the way it does in 
                         most reservoirs. You'd lose only 
                         twenty percent instead of seventy or 
                         eighty. He made this city.

                                     GITTES
                         And that's what you were going to do 
                         in the Valley?

               EXT. POND  CROSS AND GITTES

                                     CROSS
                              (after a long moment)
                         No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am 
                         doing with the Valley. The bond issue 
                         passes Tuesday. There'll be ten 
                         million to build an aqueduct and 
                         reservoir. I'm doing it.

                                     GITTES
                         There's going to be some irate 
                         citizens when they find out they're 
                         paying for water they're not getting.

                                     CROSS
                         That's all taken care of. You see, 
                         Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the 
                         water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to 
                         the water.

                                     GITTES
                         How do you do that?

                                     CROSS
                         Just incorporate the Valley into the 
                         city so the water goes to L.A. after 
                         all. It's very simple.

               Gittes nods.

                                     GITTES
                              (then)
                         How much are you worth?

                                     CROSS
                              (shrugs, then)
                         I have no idea. How much do you want?

                                     GITTES
                         I want to know what you're worth. 
                         Over ten million?

                                     CROSS
                         Oh, my, yes.

                                     GITTES
                         Then why are you doing it? How much 
                         better can you eat? What can you buy 
                         that you can't already afford?

                                     CROSS
                              (a long moment, then:)
                         The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. 
                         Now where's the girl?... I want the 
                         only daughter I have left... as you 
                         found out, Evelyn was lost to me a 
                         long time ago.

                                     GITTES
                              (with sarcasm)
                         Who do you blame for that? Her?

               Cross makes a funny little cock of his head.

                                     CROSS
                         I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. 
                         Gittes, most people never have to 
                         face the fact that at the right time 
                         and right place, they're capable of 
                         anything. Take those glasses from 
                         him, will you, Claude?

               Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses. 
               Gittes doesn't move.

                                     CROSS
                         It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's 
                         really not worth it.

               Gittes hands over the glasses.

                                     CROSS
                         Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn 
                         allows me to see her, or I'm not 
                         averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If 
                         I have to buy the jail. Hollis and 
                         Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen 
                         years. It's been too long, I'm too 
                         old.

               EXT. CHINATOWN STREET  NIGHT

               The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese 
               in traditional dress.

               GITTES

               Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly 
               lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near 
               a laundry truck.

               Gittes sees them, keeps driving.

                                     CROSS
                              (suddenly)
                         Stop the car. Stop the car!

               Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The 
               car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.

               EXT. STREET  CROSS

               Leaps out of the car shouting:

                                     CROSS
                         Katherine! Katherine! Wait!

               Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at 
               Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and 
               the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd 
               scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit 
               Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the 
               pavement.

               CURLY

               Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.

                                     GITTES
                         No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get 
                         'em out of here!

               He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the 
               sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it 
               but someone else has it.

               EVELYN

               Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control of 
               herself.

               GITTES

               Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, don't help him. Don't do anything.

               Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds 
               the revolver on him.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's gone. It's no good.

                                     CROSS
                         Where?

                                     GITTES
                              (moving to Evelyn)
                         Let me handle that.

                                     EVELYN
                              (to Gittes)
                         I'm all right.

                                     GITTES
                              (she's not)
                         Sure, but I'd like to handle it.

               Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.

                                     CROSS
                         You're going to have to kill me, 
                         Evelyn. Either that or tell me where 
                         she is.

               Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the 
               pistol.

                                     CROSS
                         How many years have I got?... she's 
                         mine too.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's never going to know that.

               There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes 
               grabs Cross.

               Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees 
               them.

                                     GITTES
                         Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.
                              (to Walsh)
                         Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to 
                         bring the police department with 
                         you.

                                     WALSH
                         Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all 
                         over the place. You oughta know 
                         better.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Walsh, meaning 
                              Cross)
                         Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, 
                         will you?
                              (moving to Evelyn)
                         Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in 
                         Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. 
                         It's the Evening Star. He'll be 
                         waiting. I'll take care of this.

               She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and he looks 
               at her.

               She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run 
                         around like that.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know 
                         what's going on. Let her go. I'll 
                         explain it later.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious 
                         offense pointing that at an officer 
                         of the law. It's a felony.

                                     GITTES
                         Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (starting toward her)
                         I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         Lou, she will kill you. Let her go 
                         for now. You don't know.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Gittes, stay outta this.

               Escobar continues to move toward her. Gittes grabs him.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Evelyn)
                         Now take off.

               Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets Escobar 
               go.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I'll just have her followed. She's 
                         not going anywhere.

               There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the 
               block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his 
               double-parked car.

               Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street. 
               It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a 
               halt.

               Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out, 
               inert.

               Blood is pouring from her right eye.

                                     GITTES
                              (yelling)
                         No!

               He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up. Cross 
               himself elbows through.

                                     GITTES
                         Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll 
                         kill the son of a bitch.

               Several officers contain Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Escobar)
                         Who is he, get his name? I'll kill 
                         him.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (badly shaken)
                         Take it easy, take it easy, it was 
                         an accident.

                                     GITTES
                         An accident?

               Gittes looks down. What he sees horrifies him. Cross is on 
               the ground, holding Evelyn's body, crying.

                                     GITTES
                         Get him away from her. He's 
                         responsible for everything. Get him 
                         away from her!

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (stunned)
                         Jake, you're very disturbed. You're 
                         crazy. That's her father.

               Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to them)
                         You wanna do your partner the biggest 
                         favor of his life? Take him home. 
                         Just get him the hell out of here!

               Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh, 
               literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying 
               to shake free.

               Through the crowd noises, Walsh can be heard saying, "Forget 
               it, Jake. It's Chinatown."

                                         THE END

          centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting
          at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home,
          with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela,
          attends to her notebook.
                         
          On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid
          plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are
          packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand.

                          DON LUIS
           Can you believe this guy Marco?
           We started when we were little...how
           old were we Fabio?
                         
                          FABIO
           Ten.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Ten year old bastards stealing
           apples from the carts in the market.
           After all we've been through.
           And now we're on top, he wants to
           leave...
                         
                          FABIO
           Luis, I'm going to be honest with
           you. You remember I had that
           operation?
           3.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           That was last year.
                         
                          FABIO
           Since then, I'm not a hundred
           percent. And you can't do this
           thing if you're not a hundred
           percent. I'm tired.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           So you'll take a rest.
                         
                          FABIO
           You know how many times we should
           have been dead?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I don't even want to count.
                         
                          FABIO
           Neither do I. But you gotta think.
           How lucky we are to still be alive.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Yeah. That's right. We're alive.
           And what about the future of this
           thing we built?
                         
                          FABIO
           It's yours. It's not my thing any
           more.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I'm not going to talk you out of
           it, am I cabron?
                         
                          FABIO
           I'll always be there for you Luis.
           Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I'm gonna hold you to that. You
           bastard.
                          (EMOTIONAL)
           I'm going to miss you.
                         
                          FABIO
           And I'm going to miss you.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           OK. Enough of this sentimental
           bullshit. Next we'll be crying
           like two old women. Come on! One
           last drink, huh?
                         
          He pours the liquor into the glasses.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           To the future.
           4.
                         
          They tap glasses.
                         
                          FABIO
           Bueno.
                         
          They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           So. Business is all clear?
                         
                          FABIO
           All clear.
                         
          He hands Don Luis a computer disc.
                         
                          FABIO
           It's all here.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           No other copies?
                         
                          FABIO
           You even have to ask?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Hey.
                         
          He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close
          as brothers.
                         
                          FABIO
           Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't
           get in too much trouble.
                         
                          MARCO
           Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
                         
          And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches
          him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself
          a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Kill this motherfucker.

          Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back,
          the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained,
          calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine
          on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes
          off.
                         
          Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.
                         
                          FABIO
           This fucker! The motherfucker!
                         
          He keeps banging the dash.
           5.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not OK Boss?
                         
                          FABIO
           This bastard thinks I'm an idiot.
           Playing it all mellow and shit.
           If he would have yelled and screamed
           and threatened to kill my whole
           family, it would have been OK. We
           have an hour to get out of here.
           At most.
                         
          Off the nervous looks of the guys in the car...
                         
          EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to
          three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the
          car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
                         
          INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
                         
          Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the
          screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses
          a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension
          filled face.
                         
                          MOTHER
           Fabio?
                         
                          FABIO
           We've got ten minutes.

           Cataleya, go pack!
                         
                          CAT
           I'm packed Mama.
                         
          Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as
          Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the
          frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame,
          comes over to Cat.
                         
                          FABIO
           Listen to me my darling. Just in
           case of anything. This...
                         
          He holds the chip up.
                         
                          FABIO
           This is your passport. Do you
           understand?
                         
          She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card
          out of his pocket.
           6.
                         
                          FABIO
           You find yourself alone? You go
           to the address on this card. Show
           it to the man at the front gate.

                          FABIO
           You don't have to understand. You
           just have to listen, and remember.
                         
          As Cat looks at the chip.

          As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling
          down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their
          weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows
          roll down.

          Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off,
          folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around
          his neck, drapes it over hers.
                         
                          FABIO
           And this will keep you safe.
                         
          Cat looks down at the medal.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE MEDAL

                          FABIO
           The Cataleya orchid. It comes
           from one place on Earth. Our place.
           My mother, your grandmother, used
           to grow them. Every morning I
           would wake up to the sight of them.
           The smell of them. That's why I
           named you after them. It reminds
           us of who we are.
           7.
                         
          He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the
          doorway with two suitcases.
                         
                          MOTHER

           They said he's not home yet.

           OK. OK.
                         
          He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up
          to Fabio's men.
                         
                          MAN

          As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the
          shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the
          street.
                         
                          FABIO
           Back!
                         
          He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window.
          Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the
          men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they
          retreat toward the front door...
                         
                          FABIO
           Too late. Get ready!
                         
          The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room.
          Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat.
                         
                          FABIO
           I love you very much.
                         
                          CAT
           I love you too Papa.
                         
          CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND
                         
          Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun
          strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife.
                         
          And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.
           8.
                         
                          FABIO
           Alicia!
                         
          His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault
          rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up
          shooter's positions facing the door.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Sitting at the table, very still. Watching.
                         
          ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER
                         
          Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles,
          sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting,
          waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to
          kingdom come.
                         
          But they never get the chance because...
                         
          BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
                         
          Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the
          room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one
          shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred.
                         
          Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents
          bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them
          twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood
          splattering across the room, across her.
                         
          And then...
                         
          Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's
          absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair.
                         
          And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into
          the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living
          thing in the room.
                         
          Cat. Marco enters.
                         
                          MARCO
           You in the kitchen. You, the
           bedroom. You, the back.
                         
          The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat,
          who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read.
                         
          One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her
          head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink.
                         
          ANGLE ON MARCO
                         
          Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD
                         
          He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...
           9.
                         
                          MARCO
           Hey! What are you doing?
                         
          As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking
          for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in
          his hand.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           Don Luis said kill everyone.
                         
                          MARCO
           He also said no names.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           She won't remember.
                         
          He is about to pull the trigger.
                         
                          MARCO
           HEY!
                         
          The gunman stops.
                         
                          MARCO
           She's a kid.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           So what?
                         
                          MARCO
           What do you mean so what? You
           take a kid, teach them, they have
           value.
                         
          The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her
          teeth.
                         
                          GUNMAN
           I couldn't even get ten bucks for
           her in the street.
                         
          The gunman is about to pull the trigger again.
                         
                          MARCO
           Are you stupid or what? Here.
                         
          Marco hands him some cash.
                         
                          MARCO
           Here's twenty asshole. Go do your
           job.
                         
          Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house
          apart, looking for something.
                         
          Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of
          water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as
          he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.
           10.
                         
                          MARCO
                          (SOFTLY)
           Remember me Cataleya?
                         
          Cat shakes her head no.
                         
                          MARCO
           I was at your confirmation. My
           name is Marco, and I was a very
           good friend of your father. I see
           he gave you his medal.
                         
          Alluding to the medal around her neck.
                         
                          MARCO
           The Cataleya orchid. His symbol.
           Your name. That's good. This way
           you will always remember him.
                          (BEAT)
           I know this is a terrible thing
           for you to have seen.
                         
          All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies
          of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.
                         
                          MARCO
           Some things are too complicated
           for a kid to understand. This is
           one of them. But I am going to
           try explain it and make it very
           simple for you. So you understand.
           Now, you know who Don Luis is?
                         
          Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips
          imperceptibly under the table.
                         
          CLOSE ON HER HAND
                         
          Touches the handle of the knife taped there.
                         
                          MARCO
           Of course you do. He was your
           father's best friend since they're
           kids. He's like an Uncle to you.
           You know he has always been good
           to your family, don't you?
                         
          Again Cat shakes her head.
                         
                          MARCO
           This house, the food you eat, the
           clothes you wear. Even your school
           fees. All this comes from Don
           Luis. You know that?
                         
          Again Cat shakes her head.
           11.
                         
                          MARCO
           But when someone is good to you
           and you are not good to them back,
           then bad things happen. Things
           like...
                         
          He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.
                         
                          MARCO
           This.
                         
          Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in
          her eyes.
                         
                          MARCO
           I know you are a smart girl. You
           do well in school. So I know this
           is not too complicated for you to
           understand. Am I right?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
                          MARCO
           Good. Now, your father had
           something that belonged to Don
           Luis. A little thing. No bigger
           than...
                         
          He holds up his thumbnail.
                         
                          MARCO
           This. Maybe it was in this.
                         
          He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of
          the wood.
                         
                          MARCO
           Do you know what I am talking about?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
          CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND
                         
          Gripping the knife handle.
                         
                          MARCO
           Excellent. Do you know where it
           is?
                         
          Cat nods.
                         
                          MARCO
           Well, if you give it to me, Don
           Luis will be very grateful. And
           very generous. He will make sure
           that you are clothed, fed, and
           sent to the very best school. You
           will have everything you want.

                          MARCO (CONT'D)
           But if you don't give it to him,
           he will be very unhappy. And you
           see what happens when he is not
           happy, yes?
                         
          Cat nods yes.
                         
                          MARCO
           So why don't you just give that
           little thing which belongs to him.
           Will you do that?
                         
          Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from
          underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles,
          kindly. He holds out his hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           You are a smart girl.
                         
          Marco opens his hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           And in this life, smart girls get
           everything they want. What do you
           want Cat?
                         
          And just as she is about to open her hand...
                         
          CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND
                         
          Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped
          there.
                         
                          MARCO
           Just tell me sweetheart...what do
           you want?
                         
          In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's
          unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife
          pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the
          table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
          but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.
                         
                          CAT
           (in his ear)
           To kill Don Luis!
                         
                          MARCO
           AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!
                         
          The men searching look up, and before they can react, Cat
          races past them.
                         
                          MARCO
           Get her!
                         
          TRACK WITH CAT
           13.
                         
          As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the
          bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her
          onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back,
          she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head
          first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny
          window.
                         
          And she drops...
                         
          Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the
          window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the
          medal of her father.
                         
          ON THE BATHROOM
                         
          One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through,
          looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something
          beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below.
          Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and....
                         
          BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!!
                         
          Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her
          feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the
          barrage stops.
                         
          ON THE GUNMAN
                         
          His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one
          in...
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses
          that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela.
          She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father
          gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps
          over the small divide between her house and the next roof,
          and takes off running.
                         
          ON THE GUNMAN
                         
          Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof,
          out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to
          shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the
          ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding
          his bloody rag wrapped hand.

          Cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a
          drain pipe onto another roof.

          ANGLE ON THE GUNMEN
                         
          Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint
          across the roof in hot pursuit.
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a
          vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.

          Marco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly
          with a piece of his shirt.

          He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on
          motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four
          different directions.

          As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley.
          She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door,
          which gives way and enters...
                         
          AN OPEN COURTYARD
                         
          Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap.
          They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood
          splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither
          does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the
          far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
          of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
          gate, hiding it.

          They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly
          kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
          the rows of tomato vines.
                         
          When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over
          the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes
          the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth
          man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
                         
          And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he
          has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.

          They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look
          up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from
          the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.

          She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting
          outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
                         
          At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders
          see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the
          alley...
                         
          VRROOOM!
                         
          And bear down on Cat.
                         
          Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one
          of the open doors, but she finds that one after another
          the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
                         
          The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for
          them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks
          down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal
          pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through
          the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her,
          tear through the sheets...
                         
          AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR
          THROATS.

          hill.
                         
          AND JUST AS SHE DOES...
                         
          Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON
          BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat.

          Cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney,
          mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress.
          The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered
          tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down
          the street. When she hears the sound of a vehicle. She
          looks up to a jeep turning the corner.

          He turns to Cat, who nods yes.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           May I see it?
                         
          Cat takes a beat. Puts her fingers down her throat. And
          throws up all over the man's desk.
                         
                          AMERICAN 1
           Oh jeez...
                         
          Cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with
          the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk,
          who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her,
          gingerly. He looks at the chip, looks at Cat.

           Yes...my passport.
                         
          INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
                         
          Cat watches out the window as the plane's landing gear
          drops and the city of Miami spreads out before her in all
          it's shimmer and glistening glory.

           We are making our final approach

           Please fasten your seat belts.
                         
          She looks down at the medal around her neck. A tear forms
          in her eye. Rolls down her cheek. Impossible to tell if
          it is a tear of joy or sadness.
                         
          INT. JETWAY - DAY
                         
          Cat, with a plastic envelope holding her travel documents
          around her neck, accompanied by an airline rep, walks down
          the jetway toward the entrance to the airport, where a MAN
          is standing. Looking directly at her.
                         
          All the passengers are filing to the left as they leave
          the jetway, but as Cat and her escort approach the man...
                         
                          MAN
           Come with me.
                         
          He walks to the right.
                         
          INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Cat stands in front of a rotund bureaucrat, with the man
          who escorted her, handing over her passport.
                         
                          BUREAUCRAT
           She's the one?
                         
                          MAN
           She is indeed.
                         
          The Bureaucrat looks at her passport. As Cat glimpses
          through the slatted window looking out over the Customs
          floor, where all the other passengers are being processed
          in long lines.
           22.

           You must have done something pretty
           important to get the royal treatment
           little lady.
                         
          Cat says nothing. He stamps her passport.
                         
                          BUREAUCRAT
           Welcome to America.
                         
          Cat looks at him, not sure if this is good news or bad
          news.

          Cat looks out the window of the car at the skyline passing
          by, silent, filled with wonder.
                         
                          MAN
           You like music?
                         
          Cat looks at him, doesn't respond. He turns the radio on.
          A god awful C&W song comes on. Cat looks at him for a
          moment, then reaches over, turns the radio off. Goes back
          to looking out the window.
                         
          EXT. BOARDING SCHOOL - EVENING

          Cat does not respond, she just stares out the window.
                         
                          MAN
           It's been a long day for her.
           Here's the check for the year's
           tuition.
                         
          He hands over a check.

           allowance for the first six months.
                         
          He hands over a wad of bills.

          She places the money in an envelope with Cat's name on it,
          and puts the envelope into a drawer.
                         
                          HEADMISSTRESS

           incidentals.
                         
          She hands a twenty to Cat. Who takes it without saying a
          word.

          Three dozen girls of all ages go about their business.
          Some do homework on their beds, others do their hair, dance,
          run around.
                         
          And suddenly, at the sound of a door opening, they all
          stop and look in the same direction at Cat and the MONITOR
                         
                          MONITOR

           Wake up is at seven. Sweet dreams.
                         
          She exits. All the girls stare at Cat. No one makes a
          move. In the silence, you can hear a pin drop, until...
                         
          The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone,
          and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her
          face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name
          is...
                         
                          SHERRI

           Very tired.
                         
          The girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them,
          no good rising on her smirking face.

           Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you
           want to lay down and rest your
           little head?
                         
                          CAT

           There's your bed...
                         
          She points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is
          about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in
          her chest.
                         
                          CAT
           But it's gonna cost you.
                          (BEAT)
           Twenty dollars.
                         
          Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging
          on every word, waiting to see what jumps off.
                         
          Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts
          the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it
          over to Sherri.
                         
                          SHERRI
           A week. Peace has it's price,
           y'know what I'm saying?
                         
          Cat says nothing, just stares at Sherri.
                         
                          SHERRI
           Are we clear on that?
                         
                          CAT
           Twenty dollars a week.
                         
          Sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She
          unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other
          twenties.
                         
                          SHERRI
           We got a smart one!
                         
          The other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand
          from Cat's chest.
                         
                          SHERRI
           You can go now.
                          (BEAT)
           In peace.
                         
          Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all
          the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat
          has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering
          resumes.
           25.
                         
          Cat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her
          jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds
          it close in her hand, just lays that way.

          Cat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall
          is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit
          she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A
          door marked: HEADMISTRESS.
                         
          Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's
          medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock.
          Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear,
          she enters.

          name on it.

          Cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth.
          Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and

          2. Sherri fast asleep, her hands and feet tied to the post
          of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt
          gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across
          her stomach. And the drawing of the Cataleya orchid.

          Cat, barely up to the window, hands the ticket agent the
          piece of paper her father gave her. The woman looks at
          the paper.
                         
                          TICKET AGENT
           Chicago is not next door, you know.
                         
                          CAT
           How much?
                         
          Cat holds up the envelope from the headmistresses office.
                         
          MONTAGE DAY/NIGHT
                         
          The landscape of America passes by through the window of a
          bus. Clutching a new Lara Croft comic, nibbling on a big
          Mac and fries out of a bag, Cat sees...
                         
          The sugar cane harvests in the Florida wetlands.
                         
          Two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack
          shelling peas in the deep South.
                         
          The Steel Mills of Pittsburgh fire up.
                         
          The endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from
          horizon to horizon across Ohio.
           27.
                         
          The giant milk barns of Indiana with their hundreds of
          cows.
                         
          And finally, sees the great city of Chicago looming in the
          distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it.
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT
                         
          As seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people
          hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with
          the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey.
                         
          Cat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks
          things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty
          sleazy types.
                         
          Cat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf
          hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points
          her in a direction.
                         
                         MONTAGE
                         
          Cat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago.
                         
          Sees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in
          Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian.
                         
          She hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her
          onward.
                         
          She walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass.
          She hands one her paper, he points her on.
                         
          She walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques.
                         
          She walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along
          the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue,
          over the bridges...
                         
          Until she comes to...
                         
          EXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
                         
          The denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as
          they are. Gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to
          happen at every turn.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she
          passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems
          lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar
          see her. The leader of the group calls her over.
                         
                          MAN
           Hey kid. You know what time it
           is?
                         
          Cat shakes her head.
           28.
                         
                          MAN
           It's late, and this is not the
           kind of place a kid should be
           hanging out. What are you doing
           here?
                         
          Cat hands him her paper. He looks at her, suspicious.
                         
                          MAN
           Who are you?
                         
                          CAT
           Cataleya.
                         
          The man takes a moment...
                         
                          MAN
           Wait here.
                         
          He disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond.
          Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches
          street life. She sees...
                         
          Hookers soliciting men in passing cars.
                         
          Cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase.
                         
          Men playing craps against a wall.
                         
          Some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than
          anything else.
                         
          CLOSE ON A FIST COLLIDING WITH A FACE
                         
          A very bloodied face. Once, twice, three times.

          INT. ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          EMILIO RESTREPO, 35, a hard case, fuck with me at your own
          risk written all over his face, is about to deliver another
          crushing blow to a poor soul strapped to a chair when...
                         
                          MAN
           Emilio.
                         
          The beating stops, Emilio turns.
                         
                          MAN
           There's a girl looking for you.
                         
                          EMILIO
           I'm not interested in a girl right
           now.
                         
          He turns back to the task at hand. Cocks his fist.
           29.
                         
                          MAN
           It's not that sort of thing. She's
           eight.
                         
          Again, Emilio stops. The man hands her Cat's paper.
                         
                          MAN
           Says her name's Cataleya.
                         
          This focuses Emilio's attention.
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Cat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs
          appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who
          disappeared.
                         
                          MAN
           Come with me.
                         
          He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley.
                         
          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals,
          on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth,
          stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat
          to enter.
                         
          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat
          looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she
          walks along.
                         
          In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are
          being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen
          merchandise.
                         
          In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns,
          hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery.
                         
                          MAN
           Hey!
                         
          Cat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns,
          to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of
          the hall.
                         
          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Cat enters an office with three women working on computers.
          Looks like any other business office. At the sight of
          Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind
          them. Cat is left alone.
                         
          She looks around the office, when the sound of a door
          opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches
          her cautiously, scrutinizing her.
           30.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Cataleya?
                         
          Now it is Cat who hesitates.
                         
                          CAT
           Uncle Emilio?
                         
          Emilio covers his mouth, seems rocked.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Madonna! I thought you were dead!
                         
          He crosses himself.
                         
                          EMILIO
           I thought you were all...
                         
          Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms,
          lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended,
          emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time
          emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower
          lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She
          bursts into tears.
                         
                          EMILIO
           You're safe now.
                         
          All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept
          locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one
          massive wave.
                         
                          EMILIO
           You're safe.
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING
                         
          The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused
          light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as
          it ascends in the sky.
                         
                         CLOSE ON
                         
          One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between
          a window and the shade covering it.
                         
                         CLOSE ON
                         
          The ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face.
          She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For
          a moment she does not remember where she is.
                         
          PULL BACK TO
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers
          her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a
          boy's room.
           31.
                         
          With models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster
          of Al Pacino as Tony Montana in SCARFACE. A poster with
          every imaginable type of assault rifle.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning
          paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty
          breakfast. An elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his
          coffee cup.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Gracias mama.
                         
          A noise turns both of them to the doorway and Cat.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Good morning.
                         
                          MAMA
           Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit.
           I'll make you some eggs.
                         
          Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a
          grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly,
          whispers into her ear.
                         
                          MAMA
           You have your mother's beautiful
           eyes. Don't be scared. This is
           your home.
                         
          Slowly, hesitantly, Cat makes her way across the kitchen
          to the table, where she sits opposite Emilio, tentative.
                         
                          EMILIO
           When was the last time you slept?
                         
                          CAT
           I don't know. A long time ago.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Well good. A growing body needs
           sleep. When I was your age I would
           sleep half the day. I don't know
           if it helped with the growing, but
           I was well rested for whatever
           came after.
                         
                          CAT
           Whose room is that?
                         
                          EMILIO
           My son. Your cousin.
                         
                          CAT
           Where is he?
           32.
                         
                          EMILIO
           He's dead.
                         
          His voice holds anger, not sadness.
                         
                          CAT

          Mama comes over, puts a plate of eggs in front of her. As

          She keeps shoveling food in her mouth. Emilio looks up at
          his mother, who crosses herself. Cat finishes the last
          mouthful, looks up.

           do it myself.
                         
          She walks off. Emilio grabs her.

          Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster,
          and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming
          down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a
          fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a
          shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot
          twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.

           If you want to be a killer, and
           survive, you have to be a smart
           one. You have to know things
           besides how to pull a trigger.
           You have to know how the world
           works. How people think. You got
           to learn to be psychological.
           That I cannot teach you, unless
           you learn the basics at school.
           Got it?
                         
          Cat glares at him.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Now what's it going to be?
                         
          He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the
          other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag
          from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off
          together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers,
          and people pour out of the school and the surrounding
          stores. As they put distance between the chaos and
          themselves.

          falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later,
          two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely
          legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a
          very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed
          by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died-
          and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads
          SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands,
          and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk
          supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser,
          looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned
          cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice...

          look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing.

          And even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam
          her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps
          laughing, and laughing.

          A quiet night in the small station. Cat stands in front
          of the booking desk, so drunk the two cops have to hold
          her up. A surveillance camera over the desk innocuously
          records everything. Cat keeps her head down, her face,
          obscured by her mane of hair.

           That's not a crime.
                         
                          CAT
           Thank goodness.
                         
          And she teeters over, passes out cold right on the
          Sergeant's desk.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Take her in the back, lock her up,
           put a cup of coffee in with her.
           Let her sleep it off, we'll book
           her tomorrow.
                         
          The two cops who booked her drag her out. As they do, the
          Sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try
          and get a look up her very long legs and her very short
          skirt.
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Three black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling
          up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS
          jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the
          vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing
          hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO.
                         
          The Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look
          out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of
          the police station.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
                         
          The station doors slam open. Marshal's barge in. The
          HEAD MARSHAL approaches the surprised Sergeant on the desk,
          flashes his credentials.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro
           Rizzo here on an overnight.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Who?
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Rizzo. The Mafia guy? On the way
           to testify up in San Francisco
           tomorrow? They didn't notify you?
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Hold on a second.
                         
          He rifles through some papers. Finds one.
           39.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Here we go. Says here you're not
           expected until tomorrow.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           Never expect the expected Sergeant.
           (to his men)
           Secure this place.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          The Marshals come down the cell block, checking everything
          out. They pass Cat in her cell, passed out cold, her long
          legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit. After a
          long look, they move on.
                         
          INT. SECURE CELL - NIGHT
                         
          Rizzo is pushed into a cell. The door is slammed and
          locked.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           One man here. Two more outside the
           front door. Everyone else on the
           perimeter, in teams of two.
                         
          He hands out thermos bottles.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           It's a caffeine kinda night fellas.
           Eyes open.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          A lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds.
          As soon as he is gone...
                         
                         ON CAT
                         
          Cat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the
          efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a
          drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup
          left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a
          small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the
          door, jiggles it. The door pops open.
                         
          Cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner,
          and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides
          along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She
          uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          One lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He
          does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward
          a blank wall.
           40.
                         
          INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
                         
          Cat, under the camera, unlocks the second door, slips out.
                         
          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Cat comes into the hall where several vending machines
          lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked:
          ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a
          door open at the far end of the hall.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE DOOR
                         
          At the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down
          the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending
          machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in
          the machine, waits for his food.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE
                         
          Where Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches
          from the cop.
                         
          The sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits
          down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on
          the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door
          across the way, enters.
                         
          CLOSE ON A UTILITY BOX PULLED OPEN

          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Cat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a
          vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board
          on one wall.
                         
          Cat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the
          wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is
          looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some
          wire, a cutter, a spring.
                         
          Cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items
          at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band
          of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a
          thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She
          takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from
          the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has
          constructed.
                         
          The device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small
          weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets
          the water container just so over the spoon from her cell.
          The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the
          panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to
          the vent in the ceiling, and is gone.

          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
                         
          Once inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off
          her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes
          a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to
          crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows
          and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between
          her teeth.
                         
          TRACK WITH CAT
                         
          As she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she
          peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one
          cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep
          as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation
          fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round.
          Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL
                         
          And Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled
          the spoon, one more drop, one more drop.

          The last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon
          tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is
          connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate
          pieces fall to the floor.

          The sergeant at the desk hears the ventilation system go
          off.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Hey Doyle!
                         
          He calls to one of the other cops on duty.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Go take a look at the breaker on

          Doyle moves off.

          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
                         
          Cat watches the blades of the vent fan slow. When they
          have completely stopped she starts to move herself through
          the very narrow space between the now stilled blades, feet
          first.
                         
          INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Doyle enters the room, opens the electrical panel. The
          spoon, the weight, the spring, and the wire, fall to the
          floor. Doyle looks at them curiously for a moment.
                         
          INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT

          Doyle looks at the switches, going down the printed list
          on the door, trying to locate the right one.

          Cat is just through, when the blades start moving, brush
          against her forehead, as she makes it to the other side
          with no time, and no room to spare.

           43.
                         
          Then walks over to the door at the end of the wall. He
          hits a buzzer on the wall.

          Right into a devastating reverse wheel kick.
                         
          INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The cop on duty hears a buzz, looks up to the bank of
          monitors, and sees the Marshal standing at the door.
          Thinking nothing of it, he hits the buzzer.

          Cat, propping the unconscious Marshal up, hides behind
          him. As the door buzzes, she maneuvers the body around,
          pushes through. On the other side, she drops the body,
          and takes his gun.

          Rizzo looks over to where the Marshal is passed out cold

          Cat hears the door begin to open. She bangs her high heels
          together. And two blades come out of the front. She sees
          the door knob turning. She runs for the roof's edge.

          When one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets
          go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the
          blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the
          roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and
          falls below.

          at the beginning of the night looks into her cell. Cat is
          laying on her side, away from them, dead asleep, in the
          same position she was when the cop first checked on her.

          collects her things and exits. As the door closes...
           50.
                         
          A DOOR TO AN SUV OPENS...
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
                         
          Ross exits the SUV to the crowd of reporters.
                         
                          REPORTERS
           Is it Rizzo? Was it an
           assassination? Are there any clues?
           Is it true a Marshal did it?
                         
                          ROSS
           No comment.
                         
          Ross sees cops coming and going from the station. He turns
          to the Marshal with him.
                         
                          ROSS
           You didn't lock it down?
                         
                          MARSHAL
           It was after the fact. I didn't
           think...
                         
          Ross cannot believe what he is hearing.
                         
                          ROSS
           Do it. Now. No one in or out.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Exiting the station. Ross and his team sweep past her.
                         
                          MARSHAL
           OK! That's it. No one in or out!
           Lock down!
                         
          Cat just keeps walking, right past Ross, who heads into
          the station as the cops try to keep the reporters at bay.
                         
          ANGLE ON CAT
                         
          Walking away from the pandemonium she is leaving behind.
          As it recedes over her shoulder, she picks at her fingers
          where the fingerprinting ink has stained them. Her prints
          come off! She drops the fake prints down a sewer and keeps
          walking.
                         
          INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - MORNING
                         
          Ross scrutinizes Rizzo's cell as his team takes prints,
          photos, sweeps the cell for evidence.
                         
                          ROSS
           I want to see paper on everyone in
           and out of the station in the last
           twenty four hours.
                         
          He looks up to the end of the hall.
           51.
                         
                          ROSS
           And I want the tapes from the

          Cat extracts a knapsack from the locker, heads for the
          woman's bathroom.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY
                         
          Cat tugs at her hair. The wild mane comes off to reveal
          her straight hair, which she pulls back in a pony tail.
          She begins to strip out of her mini skirt.
                         
          INT. BUS STATION - DAY
                         
          Cat dressed in jeans, a scuffed leather jacket, a baseball
          cap, with the brim pulled low over her eyes, with her pony
          tail sticking out of the back, the knap sack on her
          shoulder, waits on line to board the bus. She keeps her
          back to the security camera, has her phone to her ear. A
          number is ringing.
                         
          INT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emilio, fifteen years older, is watching a soccer game,
          picks up the phone. In the kitchen, Mama is cooking.
                         
                          EMILIO

          Cat moves up the line to board the bus.
                         
                          CAT
           We're good.
                         
                          EMILIO

           Say hello to Mama.
                         
          He looks over to Mama at the stove, who waves over her
          shoulder.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Mama says hello back.
                         
          He hangs up, goes back to his game.

          Cat boards the bus. The doors close behind her.
                         
          As the camera ZOOMS up, and the bus pulls out onto the
          road...
                         
           ROSS V.O.
           See?
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Ross is pointing up at the camera Cat tilted.
                         
                          ROSS
           He tilted the camera just enough
           so the angle would catch the guard,
           not who was holding him.
                         
          He turns to his team.
                         
                          ROSS
           Twenty two murders in four years
           all with the same M.O. The word,
           the flower. He's sending a message,
           for sure. And I'm beginning to
           think it's not to us.

                          ROSS
           And we're not getting anywhere
           with it, are we?
                         
          No one on the team can dispute this. It occurs to Ross...
                         
                          ROSS
           If the message is not for us, let's
           make sure the one it's intended
           for gets it. I want you to put it
           out to the press. Splash it across
           every newspaper, every magazine.
           National. I want eyeballs on it

           see if anything comes back.

          EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEW ORLEANS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
                         
          A Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of
          well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who
          wave him through.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The car ends up in front of a very impressive house, which
          sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the
          walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD,
          in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level
          government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand.
          As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see
          two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows
          them. They nod back.
                         
          Richard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is
          waiting, he looks down at the paper.
                         
          The door opens.
                         
                          MARCO
           Mr. Richard...
                         
          Richard looks up to a fifteen year older Marco.
                         
                          MARCO
           Been a long time.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Yes it has Marco. How's the hand?
                         
          Marco holds up his scarred hand.
                         
                          MARCO
           Only hurts when it's humid.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Should've let us relocate you to
           Arizona instead of New Orleans.
                         
                          MARCO
           The Boss likes it humid.
                         
                          RICHARD
           There it is then.
                         
                          MARCO
           He's waiting for you.
                         
          Richard enters. The door closes.

          Don Luis turns.

           Hello Mr. Richard.
                         
                          RICHARD
           I brought you the morning paper.
                         
          He holds the paper up.

           I've seen it.
                         
                          RICHARD
           And...?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Coincidence.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Coincidence? Twenty two times? A
           flower that only grows in one place
           on earth? That used to be the
           calling card of...what was his
           name? Your former partner? The
           one who did your wet work?
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Fabio. Fabio Maria Restrepo. But
           I don't understand? Why come here
           with this?
                         
                          RICHARD
           Because when we find the end of a
           string we like to know where it
           begins.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           String? Now we are talking about
           string? I'm not a tailor.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase
           here, OK? When the Agency extracted
           your ass from Colombia fifteen
           years ago, and set you up here, we
           let you resume your business when
           what we should have done was lock
           you up for life. In exchange, you
           were supposed to keep the
           information flowing.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           And I have.

                          RICHARD
           Not much, and not for a very long
           time.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           And this is what you traveled all
           the way down here to tell me?
                         
                          RICHARD
           No. What I traveled all the way
           down here to tell you, is there's
           a limit to our patience. The CIA
           is not an amusement park. There
           are no free rides. Everyone pays
           their way. And you, my friend,
           have not.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           OK OK. What would you want?
                         
          He slaps the newspaper down with the picture of Rizzo.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           I had nothing to do with this. I
           swear.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Then find out who does.
                         
          As he goes to leave.
                         
                          RICHARD
           And Don Luis, don't play the
           innocent with us. It won't sit
           well with my bosses if we find out
           you had anything to do with this.
           Have a good day.
                         
          Richard exits.

                          MARCO
           It could be anyone.
                         
          Don Luis reaches out, fast as a Cobra, grabbing Marco by

          Cat steps off the bus. Looks around to...

          The total full on crush of people that a major metropolitan
          bus terminal holds. She sees a surveillance camera tucked
          in a corner. She pulls the brim of her hat low over her
          eyes, takes off into the crowd.

          INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling, there is
          nothing that identifies the person who lives here. White
          bare walls, a table with one chair, a single bed. Along
          one wall, a cabinet. On the window sill a single Cataleya
          orchid. Cat waters the orchid.
                         
          Cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens. Two of
          them are divided into quarters and show various views of
          the building entrance, the lobby, the stairway, the
          elevator, the hallway.
                         
          The third screen is dark, until Cat hits a button and music
          fills the apartment. Music with a heavy sensual back beat.
          French Rap. Ooh la la. And the screen pulses and glows
          in time to the beat. Cat's body responds to the music,
          moving sexy, her shoulders rolling, her hips swaying.
                         
                         IN CUTS
                         
          Cat sashays across the open space, a stripper strutting
          her stuff; shedding, first her blouse, then her jeans, her
          lingerie, until, by the time she reaches a free standing
          opaque cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain,
          she is completely nude. She enters the shower. Turns on
          the water.
                         
          Like a snake shedding a skin, she lets the water divest
          her of everything that came before.

          The cover features WILLIAM WOOGARD, 45, the most unassuming,
          baldheaded, pudgy faced man, a nerd. Under the headline:

           He disappeared fifty billion
           dollars. The money was never
           recovered. Skipped out and bought
           himself citizenship on some shit
           hole of a Caribbean island that
           calls itself a country with no

          Cat smiles. A smile that could melt ice in winter. But a
          knowing smile. A 'Don't bullshit a bullshitter' smile.

          The truth of her words deprive him of his. She kisses him
          him on the forehead.

          A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with
          years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy
          garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
          chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal.
          And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying
          on their sides, asleep.
                         
          The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low
          growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to
          the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are
          up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes
          flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
          life, fangs bared, ready to kill.
                         
          And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming
          into their domain.

          She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle
          warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes
          going from the meat to Cat.
                         
          Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at
          her.

          the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the
          sight, enters the warehouse.

          EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - DAY
                         
          From the air, surrounded by the bluest of waters. Bestowed
          with the greenest of verdant foliage. Surrounded by
          exquisite beaches.
                         
          A spray of water fills the screen. Comes from...
                         
          THREE OF THE HOTTEST NYMPHETTES IN THE SMALLEST BIKINIS
          SPLASHING AROUND A SWIMMING POOL HAVING THE BEST TIME

           GRRRAAAHHHH!!!!
                         
          PULL BACK TO
                         
          EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
                         
          An exquisite villa surrounded by a high wall. As the girls
          clamber out of the pool, ignoring the four armed body guards
          patrolling poolside, they are met by three maids holding
          robes for them to slip into.
                         
                          WILLIAM
                          (SMILING)
           Hey! I pay to see more, not less.
                         
          The robes disappear.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           That's better.
                         
                          GIRL
           Willie you are such a perv.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I know. Anyone hungry?
                         
                          GIRL
           Always!
                         
          As William slips into a robe held open for him, he grabs
          the asses of two of the girls...
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Lunch is served.
                         
          Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a
          sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more
          servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches
          their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of
          desire, the servant holds out an envelope.
                         
                          SERVANT
           For you sir.
           69.
                         
          Perplexed, William takes his eyes off the girls and regards
          the envelope. No return address, no stamps. He opens it,
          and his perplexed look goes to one of concern.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE NOTE
                         
          It says. SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU. BE CAREFUL. A
          FRIEND.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Where did this come from?
                         
                          SERVANT
           It was in the post box this morning.
                         
          William cannot fathom what this is all about. But he does
          not like it.
                         
          EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - SUNSET
                         
          Over hot dance hall music, the sun sets magnificently into
          the shimmering sea...
                         
          INT. VILLA - EVENING
                         
          The music blasts throughout the villa. Sexy, hot. There
          are several bodyguards stationed all around.
                         
          INT. SALON - EVENING
                         
          Two of the girls dance erotically for William, who reclines
          on an oversized couch, smoking from a hookah.
                         
                         ANGLE ON
                         
          The third girl is out in the foyer, laying on the glass
          floor, which is the top of a large aquarium, where dozens
          of sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          GIRL
           Here fishy fishy!
                         
          She taps on the floor, the sharks ignore her.
                         
                          GIRL
                          (POUTY)
           Willie! They're ignoring me!
                         
          William comes over.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Put a drop of blood in there and
           they'll be your biggest admirers.
           All the way down to your stripped
           clean bones. And speaking of
           stripped...
                         
          He lifts her up like a piece of luggage. As she squeals
          with delight...
           70.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Bedtime!
                         
          The other girls come running. The party moves up the
          winding staircase. The bodyguards look at each other,
          roll their eyes.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          William is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite,
          the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the
          skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           (to head of security)
           Bring extra security in for the
           night.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           Yes sir.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           And make sure we're shut down tight.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           Yes sir. Have a good night, sir.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I intend to.
                         
          The doors close, and lock. Wild shrieks come from inside.
                         
          EXT. VILLA - EVENING
                         
          A van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men
          exit.
                         
                          HEAD SECURITY
           There are already guys in the garden
           and guys out back. I want you
           three upstairs, two on the roof.
           You three downstairs. Follow me.
                         
          As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the
          van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the
          carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes.
                         
          QUICK TIME CUTS
                         
          Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are
          on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in
          the garden outside.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that
          all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted
          outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the
          salon. He closes lights as he goes.
           71.
                         
          He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the
          front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from
          the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits,
          closing the door behind him, turning the lock.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM
                         
          The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in
          a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back,
          comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about
          their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass
          floor, takes something out of the back pack and very
          skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels
          that makes up the floor.
                         
          The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet
          suit. It is Cat.
                         
          Cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING
                         
          Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed
          where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed
          out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn
          about.
                         
          Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William.
          One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot.
          She hesitates.
                         
          CLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE
                         
          As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in
          the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door
          ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping
          soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He
          feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror,
          opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red
          lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya
          orchid. Panic starts to set in.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Hello?
                         
          No answer.
                         
          William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees
          two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood
          leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked,
          he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his
          breath coming in gasps.
                         
          INT. VILLA - NIGHT
                         
          William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front
          of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead
          guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he
          tries a light switch on the wall, nothing.
           72.
                         
          The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium
          below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Anybody?
                         
          No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is
          right in the middle...
                         
                          CAT
           Stop right there.
                         
          Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted
          pistol.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Who are you?
                         
                          CAT
           Doesn't matter who I am.
                         
          He pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He
          tries the other one. Again click click click.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           What do you want?
                         
                          CAT
           I want you exactly where you are.
                         
          And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his
          knees.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           ARRRGGGHHHH!
                         
          He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto
          the glass. The sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Whatever they paid you, I'll double
           it!
                         
                          CAT
           You know the thing about sharks.
           You can swim with them all day and
           they will just ignore you, but put
           one drop of blood in the water and
           they become your biggest admirers.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please. I'll give you anything
           you want. Don't kill me!
                         
                          CAT
           I'm not going to kill you.
                          (BEAT)
           They are.
           73.
                         
          She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling
          on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water.
          Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself
          up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns
          and walks toward the door.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please! Please!
                         
          He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits.
          And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And
          hit.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Please! Help! Help!
                         
          He is violently dragged under.

           I get stuck with a CIA Access denied

           Listen, Agent Ross, we don't give
           out any type of information over
           the phone. So what I suggest is
           you file a formal request with the
           agency for any information you
           might want. And I'll be more than
           happy to get back to you as soon
           as I can.

          People disembark. We think Cat is getting off the plane.
          It is Marco and two of his thugs. As he is crossing the
          terminal, he passes a newspaper machine. The headline of
          the paper in the window catches his eye: SHARKS EAT SHARK.
          As he stares at the picture of the dead William, his phone
          rings.

           Seems she was too drunk to get a

          The two agents look at each other, even more chagrined.
          One of them pushes a button on the computer. And the three
          angles come up. One has a shot of Cat's face covered by
          her hair, one has a shot of her face covered by her hand,
          and the third one has an angle of her nose.

          INT. SOCIAL CLUB - DAY
                         
          A dimly lit place, where strangers are few and suspicious
          looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able
          and lining the bar are par for the course.
                         
          EDUARDO, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool
          cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to
          shoot. He looks up to...
                         
                          MARCO
           Hello Eduardo, que pasa?

          He opens his arms. They hug. Eduardo is friendly, but
          there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. As they break
          marco takes a roll of cash out.
                         
                          MARCO
           Here. For you.
                         
          He goes to hand it to Eduardo.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           For what?
                         
                          MARCO
           First for fucking up your shot.
           Second, for an address. You
           remember Fabio? The Cataleya
           Killer?
                         
                          EDUARDO
           It's a long time. My memory...
                         
                          MARCO
           You went to school with his brother
           in law. What was his name? Emilio?
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Like I said...my memory...
                         
          Now the men at the bar are starting to take notice.
                         
                          MARCO
           I have a problem. And we think
           Fabio's kid is behind it.
                         
          Eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's
          shirt pocket.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Look Marco. I gotta be honest
           with you. Everyone knows you guys
           were playing a double game, and
           when the shit went down, you were
           the only ones who got out of it
           clean.
                         
          The men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has
          a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and
          conspicuous at the same time.
                         
                          MARCO
           So you do have a memory.
                         
                          EDUARDO
           Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck
           out, and let me take my shot.
                         
                          MARCO
           OK...
           78.
                         
          Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes
          to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker
          by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco
          grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball.
          At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns
          and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun,
          and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of
          Marco's thugs.
                         
          In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco,
          one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices
          his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that
          blood has soiled his white shirt.
                         
                          MARCO
           Fuck...
                         
          Pissed, Marco yanks Eduardo up from the floor and slams
          him onto the pool table. Sticks his gun in his face.
                         
                          MARCO

          She starts to peel off the lingerie.
                         
                          DANNY

           Nothing much.
                         
          She stops. Waiting.

           Where have you been?
                         
                          CAT
           On vacation.
                         
                          DANNY
           Really? Where?
                         
                          CAT
           Down south.

           Where there are alligators?

          He wiggles the toy.
                         
                          CAT
           There was that one.
                         
                          DANNY
           Was it nice?
                         
                          CAT
           It was OK.
                         
                          DANNY
           What did you do?
                         
                          CAT
           Nothing much. A little swimming,
           fed the fish.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK. Now you.

           Now me what?
                         
                          DANNY
           Conversation. It goes two ways.
                         
                          CAT
           OK. Want to fuck?
                         
          Danny starts to laugh. Cat, caught in the moment, begins
          to laugh as well.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK. OK. I get it. You want to
           protect yourself. I understand.
           But I'm...I don't just want to be
           here for the sex. I know a lot of
           guys would think this is perfect.
           She comes over, we fuck like mad.
           She leaves. But I need a little
           more.
                         
          She keeps staring, waiting.
                         
                          CAT
           Like what?
                         
                          DANNY
           Like...uh...some trust maybe.
                         
                          CAT
           That's a hard one for me.
                         
                          DANNY
           I got that. I'm not in a hurry.
           And just so you know. The past?
           If it's too painful right now?

           If you can't talk about? That's
           OK. But, you know, if someone
           hurt you before...like a broken
           heart or something. I'm not
           responsible for that. I just want
           want to be here for you. To know
           a little about what's inside.
           What you feel. Just a little.
                         
          Cat hesitates, standing there half dressed, feelings that
          she never wants to deal with coming to the surface.
                         
                          CAT
           I'm lonely sometimes.
                         
          She stops.
                         
                          DANNY
           ...And?
                         
                          CAT
           Isn't that enough?
                         
                          DANNY
           It's a good start.
                         
          He smiles, puts the stuffed animal aside.
                         
                          DANNY
           Now we can have sex.
                         
          Cat smiles, caught a bit off guard by his sweetness. He
          approaches her, she goes to touch him. He puts her hands
          down, gently.
                         
                          DANNY
           Let me this time.
                         
          And for the first time, she lets him touch her first.
          Let's him kiss her lips, her neck, and as he goes south,
          kissing as he goes, the CAMERA holds on her face, and for
          the first time she allows herself to receive, to give
          herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer.
          And she likes it.

          Surprise this time. Because there is someone there,
          sleeping peacefully, her face, half covered by her hair,
          bathed in the soft light of dawn...

          Cat.
                         
          Danny smiles, so pleased.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Danny puts the finishing touches on a breakfast tray. He
          looks at the stuffed animal she brought him. It warms his
          heart.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Danny stands with the breakfast tray, looking at Cat
          sleeping. He cannot quite believe it. He puts the tray
          down, takes his iPhone, points it at her, goes to take a
          picture.
                         
          REVERSE ON CAT

          Cat is disoriented.

           I didn't know if you like your

           made...
                         
          Cat jumps out of bed, starts to dress quickly.
                         
                          DANNY

          Outside Danny's door, Cat crosses to the elevator, waits
          for it to come. As she does, she fixes her clothes a bit,
          her eyes on Danny's door.
                         
                          CAT

          The door doesn't open. The elevator arrives. She takes a
          deep breath, enters. The door closes.

          Cat hurries down the aisle, keeping an eye on the security
          camera. Making sure she stays on the far side, out of
          it's range. She stops in the middle of the aisle, starts
          to examine paint brushes.
                         
                          CAT

          has the newspaper with Woogard's picture. He throws the
          paper in her face. Cat is taken aback by a display of
          anger she has never seen in this man before.

          He hands her an envelope.
                         
                          EMILIO
           Maybe this will help you understand
           what I am telling you.
                         
          Emilio leaves first this time. Cat just stands there, her
          world rocked. She opens the envelope, takes out a
          photograph, looks at it.

           Ryan, I'm twenty eight. I met
           someone who I want to be with.
           All the time. I have nothing. A
           stuffed animal.
                          (BEAT)

           Up to you Danny. I do it all the
           time. Photo goes in here. Bangs
           around the National Data base
           looking for a match. Bingo.
           Address, phone number, shoe size,
           dress size, rap sheet, anything
           you want to know. It's really no

          smiles back. Mama takes Cat's hand, kisses it. They all
          sit and listen to the Mass, like all the other families

          of the drink. As she looks out on the night sky, she lights
          a cigarette. Feeling so alone. She takes one drag on the
          cigarette, stubs it out. She takes the picture of herself
          and her parents, looks at it, sighs deeply. A tear forms.
          Her loneliness, her sense of isolation grows. For the
          first time, she seems a bit lost.

                          (TIGHT)
           What picture Danny???
                         
                          DANNY
           I took a picture of you while you
           were sleeping. With my phone.
                         
          Cat leaps out of her chair, on full alert now. She opens
          her cabinet to the four screens.
                         
                          DANNY
           Jen. I'm sorry. Really. I didn't
           mean to offend you.
                         
          Cat attaches a device to her computer. Does not respond.
                         
                          DANNY
           ...it's just you looked so cute.
           I can erase it if you want. It's
           not even a good picture...Jen?
                         
          Cat is not listening, she is looking at a message flashing
          across the screen. THIRD PARTY ON LINE.
                         
                          CAT
                          (NERVES KEENING)
           Who else saw the picture?
                         
          Cat flips the switch on her surveillance screens.
                         
                          DANNY

                          DANNY
           His sister. I didn't want to..it's
           just...I wanted to contact you. I
           wanted to...
                         
                          CAT
                          (HARD)
           What does the sister of Ryan have
           to do with this?
                         
                          DANNY
           Shari, that's Ryan's sister...she
           works at Police headquarters...
                         
          And now Cat knows everything.
                         
                          DANNY
           I just wanted to be...
                         
          On her surveillance screens, Cat sees FBI SWAT pulling up
          to the building.
                         
                          CAT
           Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny.
                         
          Cat hangs up, rushes into the bathroom, turns the shower
          on full blast. Hurrying out, on her screens, she sees the
          SWAT swarming into the building. Cat opens a cabinet. On
          the back of the door are a dozen keys. She chooses one.
          She checks the screens one more time, sees the SWAT rushing
          the stairs, the elevators. She turns off her screens.
                         
          And runs out of the apartment in her t-shirt and panties.
          Barefoot.

          INT. HALL - DAY
                         
          Cat reaches the stairs just as the elevator is reaching
          her floor. She ducks down the stairs as the elevator door
          opens, and Ross and his team step out, guns raised,
          exercising extreme caution, keeping very quiet.
                         
          INT. STAIRCASES - DAY

          QUICK CUTS BETWEEN CAT AND THE SWAT. SHE GOING DOWN, THEY
          ARE COMING UP. AND JUST WHEN THEY ARE ONE FLOOR APART,
          WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COLLIDE, RUN INTO
          EACH OTHER...
                         
          CAT EXITS THE STAIRS ON THE SIXTH FLOOR.
                         
          A MOMENT LATER THE SWAT COME RUNNING BY WHERE SHE EXITED.
                         
          INT. HALL - DAY
                         
          Swat 1 listens at Cat's door. Ross is at the end of the
          corridor.

          Ross signals for a scope. SWAT 2 takes a flex cam, and
          begins to slide it under the door.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          ...a guy eating his lunch in front of the TV.
                         
                          GUY
           Hey!
                         
          He reaches out to grab her. Cat grabs his hand and slams
          his face into his tray of food, knocking him cold.
                         
          INT. HALL - DAY

          Cat pulls down a camouflaged hinged door in the ceiling.
          On it, is a harness, with several things attached, guns,
          charges, thick metal clips. She slips into the harness.
                         
          INT. HALL - DAY
                         
          Ross's team goes from apartment to apartment. Knocking.

          On the video cam, Ross is seeing nothing in Cat's apartment.
          He points to one of the SWAT, signals for him to set charges
          against the door. The man begins to do so.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
                         
          Cat walks along in coveralls, boots and a hard hat, passing
          several crews of workers welding, hammering, doing repairs.
          She disappears into the gloaming.
                         
          FADE TO BLACK
                         
          EXT. EMILIO'S STREET - EARLY MORNING
                         
          A normal day. Kids playing ball. Trashmen picking up
          trash.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE REAR OF EMILIO'S HOUSE
                         
          Cat enters the house.
                         
          INT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Cat walks through the house like it could be a trap, a
          silencer in her hand. Her senses are keening, she is that
          alert. And then she finds the first body.
                         
          Mama. Dead. A bullet in her head.
                         
          Cat has all she can do to keep it together. Then she finds
          Pepe, a bullet in his head. It is almost too much for her
          to bear.
                         
          And then she finds Emilio, tied to a chair, tortured. To
          death. This IS too much for her to bear.
                         
          Cat cuts Emilio's beaten and bloodied body loose, and gently
          takes HIM in her arms. And begins to cry.
                         
                          CAT
           I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry

          Ross is pinning up the pictures of Cat on his board. His
          phone rings.
                         
                          ROSS

          EXT. FBI BUILDING - EVENING
                         
          The building is emptying out. In the lobby, Ross passes a
          floor cleaner and a lone security guard.
                         
          INT. MARKET - EVENING
                         
          Ross picks up a prepackaged meal.
                         
          EXT. ROSS'S APARTMENT - EVENING
                         
          Ross enters his building.
                         
          INT. ROSS'S APARTMENT - EVENING
                         
          Ross enters, turns on the lights, revealing an apartment
          as austere as Cat's. Heads for the small kitchen, where
          he is about to put his precooked meal in the microwave.
          When he feels a gun in the back of his neck.
                         
                          CAT
           This won't take long. Hands up.
                         
          Ross raises his hands. Cat reaches around, removes his
          gun.
                         
                          CAT
           Turn around.
                         
          Ross faces her.
           99.
                         
                          CAT
           Sit.
                         
          She motions him into the chair behind him.
                         
                          ROSS
           Just so you know, all this? Being
           so smart? Covering all your bases?
           It's not going to matter. It's
           already over. The whole place is
           wired with web cams.
                         
          His moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the
          side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped
          out.
                         
                          CAT
           You mean these?
                         
          Tosses the ripped out cams onto the table.
                         
                          CAT
           Talking about covering all your
           bases. Your chair is pressure
           wired. You move your ass one inch
           you don't have one anymore.
                         
          Ross looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several
          wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks
          further to the where the wires attach to a small charge.
          She puts her gun down on the table.
                         
                          CAT
           I know what you're thinking. Maybe
           yes a bluff, maybe no. But you
           have to figure yes, given what you
           know about me.
                         
          Ross does not move.
                         
                          CAT
           This wasn't what I had in mind for
           myself when I was a kid. I wanted
           to be on the other side of things.
           Like you.
                         
                          ROSS

                          CAT
           He did.
                         
          She takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the
          internet. She takes out the picture of her parents and
          her as an eight year old.
                         
                          CAT

          She places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in
          the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit.

          And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave.
          When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get
          up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair,
          tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes
          the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat,
          waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he
          breathes a sigh of relief.

          All of the sudden, a bullet shatters the window; destroying
          a picture of Richard standing with the President hanging
          on the wall just behind his head. The red dot is back on
          Richard in a heartbeat.

           She says she's using seven point
           six two steel jacketed armor
           piercing shells. And you have ten
           seconds to give her the address.
                         
          Richard starts to come unglued.
                         
                          RICHARD
           How can I be sure once she has the
           address she won't kill me anyway?
                         
                          ROSS
           You can't. But I can assure you
           that if you don't give her the
           address you will be number twenty
           four on her hit parade. Trust me
           on this one.

          A moment later, the red dot disappears from Richard's chest.
          Richard breathes out. Ross reaches out, shakes richard's
          limp hand.
                         
                          ROSS
           Thank you. Because honestly I
           didn't know how I was going to
           explain you splattered all over
           your walls.
                         
          Ross exits. Richard looks at the shattered picture. The
          President's head is intact. The bullet has ripped Richard's
          face clean off.

          approaching in the distance up the road. As he watches,

          for one of the men to move down the hall.

          signals he is riddled from below with dozens of bullets.
          The man dances like a puppet on a string, before falling
          to the floor, dead. Marco takes a grenade out, flings it.

          Hesitant, the thugs approach the hole. Pointing their
          weapons, they unload a barrage of bullets. Then stop.
          Nothing moves. One of them peers over the side.
                         
          BANG!

          The thugs and Marco run...
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The thugs set up two big ass 50 caliber machine guns at
          the two openings in the foundation.
                         
                          MARCO
           Kill her!
                         
          The thugs manning the guns let loose, blasting away. Smoke
          and flashes from the muzzles mingle with the fog.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis hears the firing, which thunders through his
          closet.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The thugs fire until their ammo is spent. As the sound
          dies away, silence reigns.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis hears the silence. He speed dials on his phone.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco's phone rings.

           Checking.
                         
          He motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope.
          Hesitant the man peeks around the side. Nothing happens.
                         
                          MARCO

          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis lets out a sigh of relief.
                         
                          DON LUIS
           Did you see the body?
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          Marco urges his man to look deeper, expose himself more,
          to look in the hole. Marco watches as the man does so,
          very cautiously. Still no movement. He moves full body
          into the opening to peer in.
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG!
                         
          Is blown back by three fast shots.

          And then he starts screaming into the hole, careful to
          stand just off to the side.
                         
                          MARCO
           You know what bitch? I loved
           killing your father. He was a
           coward! And you know what else?
           I screwed your mother behind your
           father's back! We all did! She
           couldn't get enough of it! The

          Silence. And then, a whistle from above. Marco looks up
          to see Cat, standing on a second floor balcony with two
          pistols.
                         
                          MARCO

          Marco starts to fire, his men raise their guns. Too late.
          In the blink of an eye, with bullets flying wildly all
          around her, Cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding
          Marco away. Marco and the remaining two thugs run toward
          the guest house. Out of the range of her guns.
           111.
                         
          INT. CLOSET - DAY
                         
          Don Luis is panicking. Yelling into the phone.
                         
                          DON LUIS

          Marco and the two thugs run into the small house.
                         
                          MARCO
           You two here! That door opens...
                         
          He points to the door they just came through.
                         
                          MARCO
           ...kill anything that comes through.
                         
          Marco runs into the bedroom.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Marco runs to the curtained windows, rips the curtains
          back, hoping to escape. And finds that the windows have
          metal hurricane shutters on them. With locks. Marco pulls
          out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to
          the locks. None of them work.
                         
                          MARCO
           Shit!
                         
          He runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on
          the knob, two shots ring out.
                         
                          MARCO

          No answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo.
          He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away
          from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down.
          His phone rings.

          Marco just stares at the door.
                         
                          MARCO

          There is a small sound outside the door.
                         
                          MARCO
           I will hold here! Run! Run!
                         
          The door shatters as Cat kicks her way in. Marco pulls
          his trigger. Click! Click! Click! Marco is frozen.
          Just stares at Cat. Waiting for what is going to come.
                         
                          MARCO

          Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across
          the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He
          yanks open the door, runs inside.
                         
          INT. GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Don Luis runs around Pepe's red truck and the crumbled
          Mercedes, jumps in the armored van.
                         
          INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
                         
          Don Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his
          desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the
          transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes
          blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse,
          bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear
          shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more
          room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the
          Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van,
          bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage.
                         
          EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
                         
          The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the
          gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the
          main road.
                         
          Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns
          blazing.

          As bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his
          confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he
          looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and
          firing, losing ground.

          runs out of bullets. Stands watching the van head off
          down the road.

          Humming a tune. When the van phone rings. Surprised, he

           You got lucky. You escaped. You

           I cannot be killed. I do the
           killing. Not the other way around.
           And now it is your turn to be
           hunted. You will never find me.
           But as day follows night, believe
           me, I will find you. And I will
           kill you. And you know why?
           Because I will never be where you
           can kill me. I will never be where
           you want me to be.

          Don Luis doesn't get it. And then he hears a low growling
          behind him. He turns a little, sees sitting there in the
          dark recesses of the van, two enormous dogs. Pepe's dogs.
          His eyes register confusion, then apprehension...

                          ROSS
           Sure.
                         
          Ross gets up and leaves the room. Danny is feeling really
          shitty. He takes his phone out of his pocket, looks at
          Cat's picture. And then it rings.
                         
                          DANNY
           Hello?

           Jen...I...uh...I'm so sorry. I
           didn't mean...are you OK?
                         
           CAT V.O.
           I'm fine.
                         
          She says it without the slightest bit of sarcasm.
                         
           CAT V.O.
           Where are you?

           FBI headquarters. I didn't tell
           them anything...besides...
                         
           CAT V.O.
           That I would come over and we would
           have amazing sex. Your phone is
           tapped, you know that?
                         
                          DANNY
           I know.
                         
           CAT V.O.
           You have forty seconds before they
           pick up on this. Gives you the
           time for three questions.
           116.
                         
                          DANNY
           OK...What's your real name?
                         
           CAT V.O.
           ...Cataleya.
                         
          Danny looks at the orchid on Ross's desk. Sees the name
          tag. Smiles.
                         
                          DANNY
           Like the flower.
                         
          Now Cat smiles. How did he know that?
                         
           CAT V.O.
           Twenty seconds.

           Will I ever see you again?
                         
                          CAT
           I know where to find you.

           you to know...I could love you.
           If you let me.

           ...I love you.
                         
          Cat holds on that one for a moment...then the beeping of a
          phone connection cut...Danny closes his eyes. Ross bursts
          into the office. Grabs the phone from his hands.
                         
                          ROSS

       CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND

        an unauthorized biography by
                Chuck Barris




                                 third draft (revised)
                                           May 5, 1998

MUSIC IN:   OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL

TEXT, WHITE ON BLACK:


            This film is a reenactment of actual
            events. It is based on Mr. Barris's
            private journals, public records, and
            hundreds of hours of taped interviews.

FADE IN:

EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981

It's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.

INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his
passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P"
insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the
back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the
scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street
light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few
of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet);
.38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).

GONG SHOW

An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image
fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet,
punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The
audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck
Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the
wings to comfort the agitated performer.

                      PERFORMER
            Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.

                      BARRIS (AGE 50)
            I don't understand. Juice, why'd you
            gong this nice man?

                         JAYE P. MORGAN
            Not to be.     That is the answer.

The studio audience laughs.

                                                            2.



INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The
young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the
fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to
staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The
meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.

GONG SHOW

Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene
Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points
at it.

                      BARRIS
            We'll be right back with more stuff.

INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes.
The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a
shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a
big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands.
The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.

THE GONG SHOW

Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog.
The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image
explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot
toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a
darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past
taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like
"Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of
America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western
Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man
crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This
is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark,
and smoke. There is a knock at the door.

                      BARRIS
                (mumbly)
            Fuck. Shit. Piss.


Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He
hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer
the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge?
Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for
a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty,
young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              3.
CONTINUED:

He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked
Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in
the background.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (weakly)
          More stuff?

                    BELLHOP
          Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you
          requested. Except I couldn't find a...
              (consults list)
          ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine.

                    BARRIS
          Well, it's late.
              (mumbling and bowing)
          But thank you. Thank you for trying.
          You are a scholar and a...

Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the
hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop
places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls
out some bills.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a
          scholar and a...

Barris trails off.

                    BELLHOP
              (eyes averted)
          Thank you, sir.

Suddenly Barris becomes agitated.

                    BARRIS
          Why are you not looking at me like that?
          Do I look ugly to you?
              (runs to the mirror)
          It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping,
          see. I have a lot on my...

Barris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts
to make conversation.

                    BELLHOP
              (re: exploded tv)
          Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?

The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over
the young man's shoulder and walks with him.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              4.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    BARRIS
              (conspiratorially)
          You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell
          anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand
          dog food on my dick so the dogs would
          stick their noses into my... dick.
          Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my
          trick, my great contribution to the
          world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I
          ask you.

There is a silence.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
                 (screaming)
          I ask you!
                    BELLHOP
          I... I... I don't know, sir.

Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on
the unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass,
looks away.

                    BELLHOP (CONT'D)
          Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch
          the show every night, you wouldn't have
          to --

                    BARRIS
          I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?
              (turning to face him)
          Don't I?!

                    BELLHOP
          It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we
          appreciate that -- It's just that
          there've been complaints from some of the
          other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the
          assistant manager, requested that I --

                    BARRIS
          Still? Complaints? I specifically used
          the silencer this time! Specifically!

                    BELLHOP
          Well, the people in 917 found a bullet
          lodged in their wall. And while we want
          to accommodate you -- we certainly value
          your patronage -- there is an issue of
          customer safety.

Barris lets this sink in.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            5.
CONTINUED: (3)


                    BARRIS
          Yes, of course.

Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his
wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy
          them a magnum of your finest champagne.
          And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and
          get me a bag of plastic army men while
          you're out. I forgot to tell you before.

The bellhop sighs, takes the money.

                    BELLHOP
          Thank you for your understanding, sir.

The bellhop exists.

                    BARRIS
              (calling after)
          And some black socks!   Seven black socks,
          you rascule!

Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto
the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the
cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by
          the sight of me. And why not? I'm
          wrinkled...
              (searches for simile, then
               proudly)
          ... like a prune. Covered in liver
          spots...
              (searches for simile)
          ... like an old guy. My hair is falling
          out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of
          white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube
          of fat hangs from my waist, practically
          obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and
          shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine
          even though I left the toilet ages ago.
          My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound.
          George Orwell said every man has the face
          he deserves by fifty. Does every man
          have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as
          well? Does every fifty year old asshole
          have the asshole he deserves?

                                                             6.



EXT. TERRACE - DAY

This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a
cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in
St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the
hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          It was 1981. I had holed myself up in
          this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.
          Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my
          life.

                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          Ashamed?   What do you mean?

Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,
occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          When you're young, your potential is
          infinite. You might do anything, really.
          You might be great. You might be
          Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you
          get to an age where what you might be
          gives way to what you have been. You
          weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.
          That's a bad moment. But I remembered
          something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no
          life of a man, faithfully recorded, but
          is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or
          unrhymed." I realized my salvation might
          be in recording my wasted life,
          unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a
          cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me
          understand why.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat,
sits at a desk and types manically.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I
          have written pop songs, I have been a
          television producer. I am responsible
          for polluting the airwaves with mind-
          numbing, puerile entertainment. In
          addition, I have murdered thirty-three
          human beings. I am damned to hell.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

                                                              7.



EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY

It's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly
and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a
pony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as
the boy totters on the animal.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in
          1931, my early childhood remains
          accessible to me only as a series of
          elliptical, enigmatic memories.

INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

A smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris,
who puts it in his mouth.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          The taste of bologna fresh from the
          butcher.

EXT. CEMENT YARD - DAY

A baby doll is set afire.   Young Barris dances around it.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          The sickly sweet smell of a burning
          babydoll on a crisp autumn day.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

Young Barris is being dressed by his mother. We're close on
the velvet material being slipped over his head.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Velvet brushing against my tender young
          skin, as my mother dressed me.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Young Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another
boy, as a crowd of children look on.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          A constant, inarticulate rage leading to
          fist fight after fist fight.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING

Young Barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning
sunlight pouring through his bedroom window.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          The calm I felt watching dust suspended
          in the early morning sunlight.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

Young Barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a
man walking upstairs. The young boy is clearly terrified.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I remember fear.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Toddler Barris watches his mother change clothes. He studies
her pendulous breasts. She looks down, smiles warmly.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
          Love.

                    MOTHER
          You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?

                       BARRIS (AGE 4)
          Yes.

                    MOTHER
          I bet you would like to be a mommy some
          day, wouldn't you?

                    BARRIS
          Yes, mommy. Please.

                    MOTHER
          C'mere, you.

His mother lifts the little boy to her breasts and presses
his face against them. He is in heaven.

INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Four year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with
several other four year olds. They all wear party hats.
Barris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in
birthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit
candles. He leads the children in "Happy Birthday Dear
Chuck" as young Chuck beams.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
          Rejection.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              9.
CONTINUED:


Chuck glances at the kitchen doorway. His mother stands
there, staring at him. She dressed in black mourning
clothes, complete with veil.

INT. NURSERY - DAY

Young Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair
and holds Barris's infant sister. She fusses with the bows
and frills on the baby's outfit. The light in the room is
golden and warm.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
          Expulsion.

We move in on the little boy's devastated face, then follow
him as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

A sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily
tossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old
girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the
background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing
of scales on a bass violin.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          When I was sixteen I had an experience
          with my little sister's friend Tuvia that
          left an indelible impression.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
             Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?

                    TUVIA
          I don't know who that is.

                     BARRIS
          Of course you don't.
              (beat)
          Why are you waiting around anyway,
          listening to this cacophonous cacophony,
          when you could be in your own abode
          disrupting the lives of your own
          siblings?

                    TUVIA
          I don't know what anything you say means.

                      BARRIS
          No.    You wouldn't, would you.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          10.
CONTINUED:


Barris watches Tuvia playing with the dog. She gets on all
fours and yelps, imitating the dog. This excites the dog,
who bounces around her. Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white
underwear for a while. This excites Barris. Finally he
pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over
his pants. We hear him unzip his fly.

                      BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Hey.

                    TUVIA
              (not looking)
          What?

                    BARRIS
          Hey, Tuvia.

                    TUVIA
              (turning)
          Wha-at?!

Tuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan.
She gets quiet.

                    BARRIS
          You wanna lick it?

Tuvia snorts, goes back to playing with the dog.

                      TUVIA
          No.    Why should I?

                    BARRIS
          Well, for one thing it tastes like
          strawberry. My sister tells me you love
          strawberries.

                    TUVIA
          Yeah, well... I hate strawberries.

                    BARRIS
          Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly
          like a strawberry lollipop.

                    TUVIA
          Look, I know that's not true, so --

                    BARRIS
          It is true. It's weird but it's true.    I
          just read a research paper on it.

Tuvia looks at the afghan.

                                                           11.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Middle-aged Chuck Barris turns from the typewriter and stares
out the window at the dark night sky.

                    BARRIS
              (sadly wistful)
          My first love.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Tuvia's face jerks up into frame.   She spits.

                    TUVIA
          Uchh. Yech. It doesn't taste anything
          like strawberry, you creep.

The dog sticks his head under the afghan.   Barris shoos him
away.

                    BARRIS
              (curious)
          Well, what does it taste like?

Tuvia gets up.

                    TUVIA
          Y'know, I'm gonna tell your mother what
          you just did.

                    BARRIS
          If you do, I'll tell your mother you made
          our dog lick your crack.

                       TUVIA
          I did not!

                    BARRIS
              (shrugging)
          So what?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Middle-aged Barris types as the camera glides over some of
the acquired detritus in his room: skin magazines, a gun and
silencer, liquor, a copy of Beyond Good and Evil, a disguise
kit, a kid's sprouted lima bean science fair project.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Perhaps my whole life turned at that
          point. The repulsiveness of my sex
          confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening
          pubescent girl.

                                                             12.



MONTAGE

Sequence of young Barris unsuccessfully attempting to pick up
girls at bars, unsuccessfully attempting to cop a feel on a
date in a movie theater, standing on a front porch
unsuccessfully attempting to kiss a girl good night, standing
outside of a movie theater in the rain, holding an umbrella
over his head and checking his watch.

                    BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And so I found myself in a downward
          spiral of debauchery. Endlessly chasing
          pussy. My only focus in life: to get
          laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself
          into believing that given the right
          combination of circumstances and
          deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world
          could desire me the way I desired them.
          I only wanted to be loved.

INT BAR - NIGHT

Barris is fighting another drunken guy.   He's getting
pummeled.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          A constant, inarticulate rage led to bar
          fight after bar fight.

The two men get tossed from the bar.

EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

The other guy gets up, brushes himself off, orients himself,
and after a moment starts beating Barris again.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

SUBTITLE: New Jersey Turnpike, 1955

A bus drives along. We see from the sign above the
windshield that it is bound for New York.

INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

Young Barris, age 24, in traveling clothes and red hunting
cap, stares out the window.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          As much as I tried, I couldn't understand
          my past and my present was miserable, so,
          at twenty-four, I decided what I needed
          was a future...

                                                             13.



EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955) - DAY

Young Barris, suitcase in hand, looks up at the impressive
building. People hurry by.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          ... I had heard that television was an
          industry with a future.

Barris enters the building with resolve.

INT. NBC STUDIOS (1955) - DAY

Young Barris, age 24, dressed in an NBC blazer is leading a
group of sheep-like tourists down a hall.

                    BARRIS
          Next, we'll have a look at the studio
          where they produce the Today Show.

The tourists "ooooh." Another tour group comes around a
corner. This one is led by Georgia, a perky, blonde southern
girl. The two groups squeeze past each other. Chuck tries
to make eye contact with Georgia. He smiles at her, but she
ignores him.

INT. NBC COMMISSARY - DAY

Barris is at the cash register paying for his food. He looks
around for a place to sit. He spots Georgia, sitting with a
female friend, and he sits at a table behind, so as to listen
unobserved to their conversation.

                     GIRLFRIEND
          That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda
          cute, huh?

                    GEORGIA
          Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but
          what you want is a man who's goin'
          places. A go-getter on the management
          fast-track.

Barris registers this information.

INT. NBC PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY

Barris stands at the counter talking to a female clerk.

                    BARRIS
          Management trainee application, please.

The clerk hands him an application without looking up.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          How many people applying for this so far?

                    CLERK
              (calculating)
          Let's see, including you... about two
          thousand.

                    BARRIS
          For how many positions?

                    CLERK
              (looking up and smiling)
          Five.

INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Barris sitting with a book and copying the names of three of
the board of directors of RCA onto his application under the
heading of "Personal References."

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Young Barris is having sex with Georgia. They finish.
Barris rolls off her and onto his back. Georgia sighs.

                    GEORGIA
          Tell me again.

                    BARRIS
          Head of network sales at thirty.   Head of
          the entire network at forty.

                    GEORGIA
          And?

                     BARRIS
              (rote)
          Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all
          my millions left to you.

                    GEORGIA
          You're wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck
          Barris, management trainee.

She climbs on top of Barris and begins kissing him all over.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Life was sweet. For a minute.

                                                             15.



INT. BARRIS'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Georgia is looking radiant as she reads a movie magazine.
Barris enters. She runs over to kiss him.

                       GEORGIA
          Baby doll!

                    BARRIS
          I got fired.

She pulls away, studies him for a moment, lets it sink in.

                       GEORGIA
          Fired?

                     BARRIS
          Fired.   F-I-R...

                     GEORGIA
          Fired?   What the fuck did you get fired
          for?!

                    BARRIS
          I don't know, efficiency cutback. Some
          bullshit... Look, it's gonna be...

                    GEORGIA
          Well, I'm pregnant, you fuck!

                       BARRIS
          Pregnant?

                    GEORGIA
          Yeah, pregnant!

                    BARRIS
          What the fuck did you get pregnant for?!

                    GEORGIA
          What do you mean, what the fuck did I get
          pregnant for? You got me fucking
          pregnant, you fuck!

                    BARRIS
          Well, fuck you.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris sits drunkenly at the bar.   He talks to a drunken guy
next to him.

CONTINUED:


                       BARRIS
             So I figured I'd skip town. I intend to
             be important, y'know, I can't be saddled
             with this.. But then I remembered
             something Carlyle said: "Do the duty
             which lies nearest thee."

                       BAR FLY
             Who's Carlyle?

                       BARRIS
             Dear God, why do I even bother?

                       BAR FLY
             Hey, fuck you, you condescending prick.

                       BARRIS
             Hey, fuck you.

                       BAR FLY
             Hey, fuck you.

                       BARRIS
             Hey, fuck you.

The guy punches Barris. A fight ensues.

INT. BARRIS'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Barris is drunk on the couch watching a tv game show, his
face swollen from the fight. Georgia enters.

                       GEORGIA
                 (pissy)
             Looks like I was just late.

Barris barely acknowledges this, continues to watch tv.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Barris and Georgia are in bed. Georgia is asleep.        Barris
opens his eyes, quietly climbs out of bed.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Another verite-looking interview. A middle-aged blonde
woman, the actual Georgia, is talking to someone off-camera.
Sitting next to her is a Jewish-looking middle-aged man.

                       ACTUAL GEORGIA
             I woke up and he was gone. No note. No
             nothing. I never saw him again. Until
             that stupid tv show he did.

          I know what it's called, jerk.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN    - DAY

We're close on a copy of the NY Herald Tribune. The headline
reads Clark Testifies Before "Payola" Committee. We pull
back to see young Barris, in a suit, reading the paper in a
passenger car of a moving train.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          In '61 I was thirty. I had become a
          minor suit at ABC. It was during the
          music payola scandal...

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

American Bandstand is taping. The studio is filled with
dancing teens. Barris sits off to one side behind an
imposing desk in the semi-darkness, suspiciously watching
Dick Clark's every move, and taking copious notes. Clark
glances over nervously.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          ...so my job was to commute to Philly
          every day to the American Bandstand
          tapings, and keep an eye on Dick Clark.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

The actual Dick Clark is being interviewed.

                    DICK CLARK
          Chuck Barris? He spooked me. I tried to
          keep on his good side becuase he was sort
          of... spooky.

                       INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          How so?

                    DICK CLARK
          I dunno, there was something in his eyes.
          Something dark, like unbridled ambition,
          maybe. Or an inarticulate rage.

EXT. PALISADES PARK - NIGHT

Barris walks through the crowds. A dark look in his eyes as
he follows some giggling teenage girls in poodle skirts.

          the young girls were.

INT. BARRIS'S TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Young Barris lies in bed masturbating.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I wrote a song about my experience.

The song "Palisades Park" begins.

                    FREDDIE CANNON
          Last night I took a walk after dark/to
          see a place called Palisades Park/to have

          where the girls are

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TV STUDIO

A sign above the stage reads The Dick Clark Saturday Night
Beechnut Show. Freddie Cannon is on stage singing "Palisades
Park" as a crowd of 1962 teenagers dance on the studio floor.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I got it to Freddie "Boom Boom" Cannon
          through my friendship with Dick Clark.
          Dick really wanted to help me out.

                    FREDDIE CANNON
          I took a ride on the shoop de shoop/that
          girl I sat beside was awful cute/and when
          we stopped she was holding hands with
          me/my heart was flying/up like a rocket
          ship/down like a roller coaster/fast like
          a loop de loop/round like a merry go
          'round...

Young Barris watches happily from behind the cameras. He
spots, Debbie, a pretty, bland young woman with headphones
and a clipboard. He sidles over to her.

                    BARRIS
          Hi.

                    DEBBIE
          What?



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             19.

                      BARRIS
          Hi!

                      DEBBIE
          Oh.

                    BARRIS
          I wrote this song.

                      DEBBIE
          Oh.    Uh-huh.

                    BARRIS
          It's number three on the pop charts.

Barris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof.

                      DEBBIE
          Huh.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Barris and Debbie are having dinner.

                    BARRIS
          See, I believe there's a great future in
          television.

                      DEBBIE
          Uh-huh.

                    BARRIS
          So I'm going to take my royalties and
          create a pilot. A pilot is what they
          call a test tv show.

                    DEBBIE
          I work in tv.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I
          believe there's a great future in game
          shows.

                    DEBBIE
          That's good.

                    BARRIS
          Everyone loves game shows, right?

                    DEBBIE
          I don't know.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               20.

                    BARRIS
          Well, they do.

                    DEBBIE
          That's great then.

                    BARRIS
          I'm on my way!

There is a long, awkward silence.    They both saw away at
their steaks.

INT. DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Barris and Debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical.
They're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their
steaks. When it's over, they both just lie there.

INT. DEBBIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Young Barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi-
darkness and stares out the window. The front door unlocks
and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway. She turns on
the light. This is Penny Pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a
black leotard and skirt and black mascara. She has red hair.
She sees Barris on the couch.

                     PENNY
          Hello.

                     BARRIS
          Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie.

                    PENNY
          Yeah, I figured.

Penny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter,
and enters the kitchenette. Barris watches her ass.

                    PENNY (CONT'D)
          You hungry?

                    BARRIS
          Um, no thanks.

                     PENNY
          Thirsty?

                    BARRIS
          If you have a beer.

Penny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris.      She sits
in a chair across from him. They both drink.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                             21.
CONTINUED:


                   PENNY
         So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always
         wondered.

                   BARRIS
             (a little taken aback)
         It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.

                   PENNY
         No problem. I just got fucked by this
         drummer cat. A really righteous Negro
         hipster.

                    BARRIS
         Huh.   Interesting.

                   PENNY
         See, I believe in the brotherhood of man.
         Last week I got fucked by an Oriental.
             (beat, studies him)
         What are you?

                       BARRIS
         Jew.

                   PENNY
         That's what I thought. I had a Jew, but
         he was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi
         (pronounced Ashkuh-Natzee), I'm guessing.

                       BARRIS
          Ashkenazi.

                  PENNY
         Right. Ashkenazi... I haven't balled one
         of them.

                   BARRIS
         You're a romantic.

                   PENNY
         Eh, I just don't get into all the
         bullshit between cats and chicks.

                    BARRIS
          I know what you mean.

                    PENNY
              (not hearing him)
          You know what I mean?

                    BARRIS
          I know what you mean.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)


                    PENNY
          Besides, you fall in love with a cat, you
          only get hurt. Right?

                    BARRIS
          Don't I know it.

                     PENNY
              (beat)
          We could ball if you want.     I seem to
          like you pretty well.

                    BARRIS
          Well, that would be good. But, you know,
          I'm kind of here with Debbie. It doesn't
          seem right.

                     PENNY
          Yeah. That's true. I didn't think of
          that.
               (getting up)
          Well, I'm going to bed. Nice meeting
          you.

Penny shakes his hand and heads off.

                    BARRIS
          What's your name?

                       PENNY
          Penny.

                       BARRIS
          I'm Chuck.

                    PENNY
          Oh, you're the one who wrote that
          Palisades song. I love that song.     It's
          such sentimental bullshit.

Penny exits into her bedroom.   Barris drinks his beer.

INT. BARRIS'S TENEMENT APARTMENT - DAY

Barris and Penny are having sex on the kitchen floor.      It's
quite passionate.

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

Penny is taking a bath in the tub in the kitchen while Barris
broodingly cooks dinner at the stove.

             (animatedly)
         ... so this ape and I were looking at
         each other. It was, like, across time
         and evolution. Then he began to talk,
         but it was a language I didn't
         understand, maybe Swiss. Then he turned
         into Perry Como, real square and...
         what's wrong with you?

                          BARRIS
          Nothing.

                    PENNY
          Just because we fucked, doesn't mean
          there are strings now. It's okay.

                          BARRIS
             Okay.

                      PENNY
             Okay? I only wanted to tell you my dream
             is all. Nothing more complicated than
             that. Don't panic.

                    BARRIS
          I'm just used to all this dating
          bullshit, y'know. Now we're a couple.
          Now I'm obliged to give a shit what you
          say.

                    PENNY
          Don't worry about it, I'm not into those
          games either. So, anyway, this monkey
          turns into Perry Como and I say --

                          BARRIS
             Holy fuck!

                          PENNY
             What?

                    BARRIS
          Holy holy fuck!
              (runs over, kisses her)
          You just gave me an idea.
              (starts pacing
          For a show! Fuck!

                    PENNY
          A show about monkeys?

          About people! About sex. About romance.
          About the bullshit of dating!

INT. LEONARD GOLDBERG'S OFFICE - DAY

Leonard Goldberg, ABC executive, sits behind his desk as
Barris, holding a cardboard model of a game show set,
excitedly paces the room giving a pitch.

                    BARRIS
          I call it The Dating Game, Mr. Goldberg.
          And that's what it's about. A pretty
          girl asks three handsome guys, who she
          can't see, silly questions. And based on
          their answers, she picks one to date.
          And we pay for the date. That's it!
          That's the show! It's got everything!

EXT. ABC BUILDING - DAY

Penny leans on a signpost smoking a cigarette. Barris
emerges from the building with his cardboard set. He looks
grave. He approaches Penny.

                       PENNY
          No?

                    BARRIS
              (lighting up)
          They bought it!

Penny screams, hugs Barris.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          They bought it they bought it they bought
          it...

The two dance around on the street.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          They're giving me seventy-five hundred
          fucking dollars to make a pilot!

                       PENNY
          Oh my God!     Oh my God! We gotta go
          celebrate!     Let's go roller skating!

Penny kisses Barris.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

Barris, 32, lies on his bed on his back and tosses the
football in the air. A very very very old dog lies on the
floor. Phoebe, Barris's 26 year old sister enters.

                    PHOEBE
          Y'know, you've been staring out this
          window for six months now.

                    BARRIS
          I'm trying to come up with new tv shows,
          if you must know. Okay? That's what I'm
          doing. I believe there's a real future
          in tv.
              (holds up notebook, shakes it)
          Look. Ideas. Okay?

                    PHOEBE
          You're thirty-two years old, and you have
          no career and no prospects.

                    BARRIS
          Thanks for the status report, Phoebe.
          Look, I just gotta come up with the right
          concept. Then, boom.
              (holds up notebook again)
          Which, by the way, I've almost got.

                    PHOEBE
          You're breaking mom's heart.     You know
          that, don't you?

Barris looks out the window at his emaciated mother sitting
in the yard in an old wicker-backed wheelchair and staring
off into space.

                    BARRIS
          Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my
          being born broke mom's heart.

Barris watches his mother for a long moment.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name,
          Tuvia, anymore?

                      PHOEBE
          Who?

                     BARRIS
          Tuvia.   Your friend.   Tuvia.   The girl.

                    PHOEBE
          Oh. No. I heard something. I think she
          got divorced recently or something.

                      BARRIS
          Oh, yeah?

                                                             27.



EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

Barris knocks on the door. There is some movement inside and
a woman answers the door. This is older Tuvia, 20's,
attractive but a little hard-edged now. She balances a baby
on her hip

                       OLDER TUVIA
          Yes?
              (registers)
          Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.

                       BARRIS
          Hi, Tuvia.

Barris taken by the changes in Tuvia. The baby and the full,
milk-producing breasts get him excited.

                    OLDER TUVIA
          What do you want?

                    BARRIS
          I came by to apologize.

                       OLDER TUVIA
          Okay then.

She closes the door.    He knocks again.   She opens the door.

                    OLDER TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.
          Now what do you want?

                    BARRIS
          So I'm back in town. For a while.      I
          thought maybe you and I could --

                    OLDER TUVIA
          Jesus, you've got to be kidding.

Tuvia closes the door. Barris stands there for a moment,
considers knocking again, then turns and leaves.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT

We move along a park bench, past several homeless people, one
holding an old doll, others holding other sad items. We come
to Barris. He's wrapped in a horse blanket and holding the
miniature cardboard Dating Game set. An open notebook sits
on his lap. The pages are blank, except for one entry: The
Something Else Game. Barris holds a pen poised to write, but
doesn't.

                                                            28.



INT. BAR - DAY

Barris is drunk and in a fight. He is losing, flailing,
swinging wildly. Jim Byrd, a middle-aged, business man-
looking guy, in tinted glasses and sideburns, watches from
the bar. Eventually Barris and the other brawler get thrown
out of the bar. Byrd takes a sip of his drink.

EXT. BAR - DAY

Barris sits on the curb, nursing his wounds.    Byrd exits the
bar and casually approaches.

                    BYRD
          You're a pretty angry young fella, aren't
          you? Can't fight worth a damn though.

                    BARRIS
          Screw off, fag. Don't think I haven't
          seen you watching me in that bar for a
          week now.

                    BYRD
          Kind of a loner, I'd say. Fairly bright.
          A tad anti-social. Mad at the world.
          Can I buy you lunch?

                    BARRIS
          Look, there's a schoolyard half a block
          down. Why don't you go trolling there?

Barris gets up and starts to walk away.

                    BYRD
          I could teach you at least thirty
          different ways to kill a man with a
          single blow, Mr. Barris.

Barris stops.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Might help you in future bar fights.
          Just a thought.

Barris just stands there.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Oh, and there's money in it.    Good money.

Barris turns.

                                                              29.



INT. DINER - DAY

Barris and Jim Byrd sit in a booth.   Barris is wolfing a
hamburger. Byrd sips coffee.

                    BARRIS
              (mouth full)
          ... and I figure if I can keep afloat
          until I come up with my next game show
          idea, then all will be copacetic.

                    BYRD
          That sounds great, Chuck. Y'know, I've
          never known a television producer before.
          I'm impressed.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, yeah. So what's this money deal
          you were talking about?

                    BYRD
          Well, I work for a government agency, and
          I can always use good, enthusiastic men
          to help me carry out my directives.

                    BARRIS
          What kind of work?   What government
          agency?

                    BYRD
              (matter-of-fact)
          Problem solving work.   For the Office of
          Diplomatic Security.

                    BARRIS
          Office of what? Never heard of it.     Is
          that the fucking CIA or something?

                    BYRD
          Please be discreet, Mr. Barris.

                    BARRIS
              (whispering)
          Jesus, it is the fucking CIA! Hell, I'll
          be a spy! Where do I sign up? Are you
          fucking with me? You're fucking with me,
          aren't you?

                    BYRD
          Hardly. And you wouldn't be with the
          company. You'd be a contract agent.
          Independent. No official tie to any
          agency. Is that understood?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

          Why me?

                    BYRD
          As you know, I've been watching you. For
          years, actually. I've only let you know
          about it for the last week.

Chuck stops chewing.

                       BARRIS
          Jesus.

                    BYRD
          I'm happy to report you fit our profile,
          Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this
          work?

Long pause.

                    BARRIS
          Well, what's the profile?

                    BYRD
          Are you interested in this work, Mr.
          Barris?

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent.
          Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck
          beautiful Eastern European women. Wear a
          trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick.

                    BYRD
          The work we do is very serious. It's
          essential in quelling the rise of
          communism and allowing democracy to gain
          its rightful foothold around the globe.

                      BARRIS
          Sure.    Yeah. Okay.   That's good.

EXT. ABANDONED ARMY BASE - DAY

The place is ramshackle and overgrown.   It looks deserted.    A
barbed-wire fence surrounds it.

INT. BASE REC ROOM - DAY

A severe-looking instructor is teaching a class to an
assembled group of scary-looking men: losers, psychos,
mercenaries, Latin American thugs, and Chuck Barris.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    INSTRUCTOR #1
          There are several efficient methods of
          killing a man, were you to find yourself
          without a weapon. The edge of your hand
          against the adversary's Adam's apple.
              (demonstrates on mannequin)
          This will crush the windpipe causing
          strangulation and death.

The students take notes.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D)
          Boxing your adversary's ears with proper
          force will cause his ear drums to burst
          and possibly result in bleeding in the
          brain. And death.

EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

It's dark. Byrd sits on a step, smoking a cigarette.     Barris
approaches.

                    BARRIS
          You're training me to be a killer.

                    BYRD
          See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly
          bright.

                    BARRIS
          I can't kill people.    My future is in
          television.

                    BYRD
          Listen, you're thirty-two years old and
          you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ
          was dead and alive again by thirty-three.
          Better get cracking.

                    BARRIS
          I have ideas for shows.

                    BYRD
          Oh, good. Why don't you spend another
          six months developing 'em while staring
          out the window at mommy's house next to
          poor dead Albert the dog.

                       BARRIS
             How do you know all that?

          I know everything about you, Chuck. For
          fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk
          off with.

Barris lifts his hands, tries to remember.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          Right. Leave in the morning, if you
          want. But I'm here to tell you this is
          honest work for good pay. You'd be
          helping to make the world safer. And
          your country would be grateful.

Byrd rises, stubs out his cigarette in his hand.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)
          It'll toughen you up.

Barris sits there staring into the blackness.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Another big, frightening instructor stands before the class.
Behind him is a full-sized diagram of a man which illustrates
all major arteries and organs. He is demonstrating the
proper way to grip a knife, then using the knife, he points
to various sites on the body.

Angle on Chuck Barris. He has copied the diagram of the man
in his notebook and is writing "Carotoid artery carries blood
to brain. Death in seconds." He then writes: "Game show
idea: Slice of Life. Interesting!!"

          Glycerin is, of course, the best-known
          nitrating agent. Now keep in mind,
          nitroglycerin is extremely unstable. A
          slight tap, a one degree change in
          temperature and it'll blow up in your
          hands. Yee-haa, let's mix us up a batch!

Instructor #1 holds up a beaker.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D)
          Everybody take your 75 ml beaker and fill
          it to the 13 ml level with fuming red
          nitric acid, 98% concentration.

The students nervously pour nitric acid into beakers.

INT. BUNKER - DAY

The severe instructor is demonstrating how to use an army
field telephone to torture a man. A canvas dummy is tied to
a chair as the instructor attaches wires from the telephone
to the dummy's genitals and to his mouth. The students watch
closely, take notes.

EXT. BARRACKS - DAY

The students with suitcases and in traveling clothes are
hugging and saying good-bye. The end of summer camp. A
tearful Barris heads toward one of the waiting buses. Byrd
pulls him aside, discusses something with him.

INT. PLANE - DAY

Byrd and Barris, now dressed in a suit similar to Byrd's, sit
in first class. Byrd stirs his scotch and water with his
finger as he stares at nothing out the window.

EXT. AIRSTRIP, MEXICO CITY    - DAY

SUBTITLE: MEXICO CITY, 1965

A commercial airliner comes in for a landing.

INT. CAFE - DAY

Barris, Byrd, and two sleazy, sweaty men, Benitez and
Brazioni, sit in a booth in the back of the dark cafe.
Benitez opens up his brief case and pulls out a pile of
grainy photos of a man leaving a residence and a street map.
He lays them on the table.

             Si.   In the flesh.

          What have you got for me, Manny?

                    BENITEZ
              (re: map)
          Renda leaves his apartment every day at
          8:30, alone, walks east two blocks to
          this news kiosk, buys a paper and heads
          south four blocks to the plaza of the
          Museum Nacional to read it.

                    BYRD
          Okay. Chuck, you're here at 8:25. Dress
          like a tourist. Start walking north.
          You should pass Renda here. Stop him and
          ask him in bad Spanish where the museum
          is. Make sure he doesn't understand what
          you're asking.

                        BARRIS
          Okay.

                    BYRD
              (to Brazioni and Benitez)
          You'll be parked here. Brazioni, you're
          behind the wheel. Benitez, you're on the
          street leaning into the car chatting with
          Benitez. When Chuck stops Renda, you
          turn to help with the directions, stick a
          gun into Renda's ribs, and direct him
          into the back seat. Chuck, you get in
          first. Renda's between you and Benitez.
          Brazioni, whaddaya got?

Brazioni opens a case to reveal three Walther P-38 pistols.

                    BYRD (CONT'D)

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Brazioni and Benitez are at a table, drunk, sweaty and loud,
flirting with some women. Byrd sits at the bar, sipping a
scotch. Barris enters, spots Byrd, sits down next to him.

          Don't fuckin' dance with me, Barris.
          Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co.

INT. MEXICAN HOTEL ROOM   -   NIGHT

It's hot. There are two twin beds in the room. Byrd sleeps
soundly in one. Barris lies in the other, eyes wide open.

EXT. MEXICO CITY STREET - DAY

Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the
transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris
blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking.

                    BARRIS
          Excusa me, por favor, Senor.

Renda stops.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros?

                    RENDA
          No comprende.

Renda tries to get away from this pesky tourist.   Barris
follows him, calling after him.

                    BARRIS
          Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares?

Renda picks up his pace, as does Barris.   Benitez approaches.

                    BENITEZ
          May I be of some assistance here?

Renda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back.

                                                            37.



INT. CAR - DAY

Renda's in the back between Barris and Benitez. Brazioni
drives. Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his
gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. The car drives slowly
through the crowded Mexico City streets. They arrive at a
jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big
parade. It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with
dancing skeletons. It's wild and frightening. Brazioni
glances at Renda in the reaview mirror.

                    BRAZIONI
          Day of the dead.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first.
His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a
commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun.
He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives
behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car,
looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls,
the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the
car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is
on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking
wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out.
He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading
look in his eyes.

                    RENDA
          Por favor. No me mates, senor.   Tengo
          tres bebes.
Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air. His hand shakes.   He
pulls out Spansh-English dictionary.

                     BARRIS
          Again.

                     RENDA
          Que?
                     BARRIS
                   Repitolo.
          Again.

                    RENDA
          No me mates. Tengo tres bebes.
Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes,
startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the
bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away.
Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his
mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                       BARRIS
          Oh Christ.     Oh crap.

Barris tries to stop Renda from screaming by covering the
hole in Renda's face. Barris throws up, some of it landing
on Renda's pants. He wipes his own mouth with his bloody
hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers
are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots
Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More
blood spatters Barris's clothing and face. The church bell
continues to chime.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Barris and Byrd sit side-by-side in first class.    This time
Barris has the window seat and stares out.

                       BYRD
             Beautiful country, isn't it?

                       YOUNG BARRIS
             Yeah.

                       BYRD
             You did us proud, Chuck.

Barris doesn't say anything.

                       BYRD (CONT'D)
             Renda was a bad guy. He really was.

                       BARRIS
             Yeah.

INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

Barris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail. He
flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
             I had changed. I could see it in my
             eyes. Something dark.

Barris notices a fleck on the side of his nose.    It's dried
blood. He distractedly rubs at it.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Renda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot.   Blood
spurting. Echoey church bells chime.

                       RENDA
             No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes.

                                                             39.



INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

Barris puts down his bag, pulls the Spanish-English
dictionary from his pocket, and tries to translate what Renda
said. It takes him a while but he does.

                    BARRIS
          "Don't kill me. I am three babies." I
          am three babies? What the fuck does that
          mean?
              (studies dictionary)
          Oh. "I have three babies." Oh, God.

Barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can.
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a movement in the
living room. He lurches backwards, knocks over the can.
Vomit spills onto the carpet.

                    PENNY (O.C.)
              (groggily)
          Chuck, is that you throwing up?

In the dim light from the hallway, Barris spots Penny lying
on the couch. She is dressed as a hippy. A backpack and a
duffel lie on the floor next to her.

                    BARRIS
          Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit
          out of me. What are you doing here?

                    PENNY
          Sorry. I just been crashing here for a
          few days. Waiting for you. Where you
          been, man, where you been?

                     BARRIS
          Mexico.   Just on a little vaca...

                    PENNY
          You drank the water, didn't you?

                     BARRIS
          Yeah.

                    PENNY
          You're not supposed to. Montessori's
          Revenge. You're not even allowed to open
          your mouth or your eyes when you take a
          shower. It's crazy. How come our water
          is so good and their water is poison?
          It's the same ocean.

           It's weird, huh?
               (beat, then proudly)
           So I'm a hippy now. Look.

Penny stands in the dimness to show off her outfit.

                     PENNY (CONT'D)
           I've been in San Francisco, and it's
           amazing. Everybody loves everybody and
           there's lots of colors. We're gonna
           change the world, Chuck. Come back with
           me and be my old man, okay? Not that
           old! Ha ha ha.

                     BARRIS
           Penny, I'm a little tired now, so...

                      PENNY
           Oh!   You gotta hear this song!

Penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player.
She turns it on, plugs in a strobe light. "Sunshine Superman"
starts up. Penny sings and dances along, directing the
lyrics at Barris. Barris looks around at his strobing
apartment. He sees Penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti-war
posters, a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number
underneath.

                     PENNY (CONT'D)
               (singing)
           "Cause I made my mind up, you're going to
           be mine..."

                     BARRIS
           Penny, what did you do to my wall?

                     PENNY
               (looking)
           Oh, it's a guy who called a couple a days
           ago. Gold-Bird. Isn't it pretty?

                     BARRIS
           Leonard Goldberg?! You're kidding?
               (dials phone anxiously)
           Hello, this is Chuck Barris returning for
           Leonard Goldberg.

Pause.   Barris paces.   Penny sings and dances in background.

                       GOLDBERG (PHONE VOICE)
          Hi, Chuck!

                    BARRIS
          Mr. Goldberg! I'm so sorry I didn't get
          back to you right away. I was out of
          town. Vacationing in Mexico.

                    GOLDBERG
          Good for you. Listen, Chuck. We've
          ended up with a damn hole in our daytime
          schedule. I've been reviewing some
          options, and it occurred to me there
          might be a place here for you and your
          baby.

                    BARRIS
          My baby, Mr. Goldberg?

                    GOLDBERG
          The Dating Game.
              (joshingly)
          That is your baby, isn't it, Chuck?

                    BARRIS
          Yes sir, it is.

                    GOLDBERG
          Are you still interested?

                     BARRIS
          Yes sir.   Very interested.    Sir.

                    GOLDBERG
          Good man. We'll need to start airing in
          about six weeks. Is that do-able for you
          and your people?

                       BARRIS
          My people?     Six weeks?   Sure.   Yes sir.

                     GOLDBERG
          Great.   Keep me posted.

Dial tone. Barris sits there, phone in hand, then throws up
again into the trash can. Penny stops dancing, watches.

                    PENNY
          Damn Mexicans and their water.

                                                         42.



INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

An episode of the show is being taped.   Barris paces
nervously behind the camera.

                    BLONDE BACHELORETTE
          Bachelor number two, what would I like
          most about you?

                    BEANPOLE BACHELOR
          I am very romantic and I would send you
          flowers every day.

The studio audience "awwws."

                    BLONDE BACHELORETTE
          Aww. That's sweet. Bachelor number
          three, what would I like most about you?

                    FRIZZY-HAIRED BACHELOR
          My big cock.

The bachelorette makes a mock-horrified expression as the
studio audience erupts in laughter. Barris buries his face
in his hands.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

A brunette bachelorette asks a question.

                    BRUNETTE BACHELORETTE
          Bachelor number one, what nationality are
          you?

                    HANDSOME BACHELOR
          Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is
          Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well-
          Hung.

The audience goes wild.   Barris pulls at his hair.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

A black bachelorette asks a question.

                    BLACK BACHELORETTE
          Bachelor number three, I play the
          trombone. If I blew you, what would you
          sound like?

The audience screams with delight.

                                                             43.



INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

Leonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris
sit around a conference table and watch a tv. On it is The
Dating Game. A black bachelor is responding to the trombone
question.   He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning
and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls.
Barris has his head in his hands. Goldberg signals an
assistant, who switches off the television. The executives
look quite grim.

                     GOLDBERG
          Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are
          unairable.

                    BARRIS
          Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's
          unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't
          control what people say.

                    EXECUTIVE
          Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't
          have black men getting blow jobs on
          national television!

                    GOLDBERG
          The point isn't that he's black, Hank.

                     EXECUTIVE
              (beat)
          Well, I know that. That's not what I
          meant.

                    BARRIS
          Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these
          shows. Right? And that's good. Show
          business must avoid indifference at all
          costs.

                    EXECUTIVE
          Even when taste is involved?

                    BARRIS
          Taste is just a word.

                    EXECUTIVE
          You don't fuck with taste, my friend!

                    BARRIS
              (uncomprehending)
          What does that even mean?   I don't even
          under --

                    GOLDBERG
          Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That's
          it. If you can't figure out how to
          retain your spontaneity without the
          contestants being lewd, we're going to
          have to pull the show.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris is drunk and brooding. He picks a fight with a big
man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar.
Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he
learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp.
This gives him an idea.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

The contestants are onstage.   Barris appears, warm and
charming.

                    BARRIS
          Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today,
          I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter
          Jenks of the Federal Communications
          Commission.

The severe training camp instructor joins Barris onstage.

                    INSTRUCTOR #1
              (increasingly psychotic)
          Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if
          any of you are aware of this, but it's a
          federal offense to make licentious
          remarks on a network television
          broadcoast. The penalty for this
          disgusting, un-American behavior is one
          year in prison or a ten thousand dollar
          fine or both. Anyone making a sick,
          subversive remark tonight will be
          arrested immediately. I will then
          personally escort the offender to federal
          prison for booking under edict number 364
          of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a
          long drive to that prison. Just you and
          me. No other witnesses --

                    BARRIS
              (jumping in)
          Any questions?

There are none. The contestants are paralyzed with fear.
Jenks is red-faced, trembling.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris being interviewed.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          Sometimes as a younger man I stretched
          the truth to get what I wanted. "Through
          all the lying days of my youth/I swayed
          my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I
          may whither into the truth." Yeats. You
          heard of him?

                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          Yeah.   Of course.

                     ACTUAL BARRIS
          Sure you have.
              (beat)
          Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired
          and become a big hit. A phenomenon,
          really.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE, BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY

SUBTITLE: BARRIS PRODUCTIONS, LOS ANGELES, 1967

This is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed.
Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles,
lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. Barris, 36, is
behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. He wears a t-
shirt and jeans and loafers. This is a new Barris, confident
and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. Outside in
the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and
screaming of a busy but casual office.

                    BARRIS
              (into phone)
          Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to
          you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye.

Barris hangs up the phone. His jovial facade disappears.   He
opens up his ice bucket. It's empty.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (yelling)
          Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice!

Loretta, Barris's pretty young secretary, enters with a new
bucket of ice. She is braless and shoeless.

                    LORETTA
          Jesus, Barris, take a Darvon.

Loretta drops the bucket of ice on his desk. Barris grabs
her arm, pulls her toward him, kisses her on the back of the
neck.

                       BARRIS
          Hey, baby.

Loretta acts annoyed, but it's playful.

                       LORETTA
          Asshole.

                      BARRIS
          I know.    Sit. Talk to me.

Loretta sighs and drops into a bean bag chair. Barris puts
some ice in a glass and pours himself a scotch.

                    LORETTA
          I'm busy. We're in the middle of a
          bachelorette crisis out there.

                    BARRIS
          I just got a call from the network.
          Drink?

                    LORETTA
          You got any weed?

                       BARRIS
          I wish.

                    LORETTA
          Then I'll have a drink.   Bad news?

Barris pours a drink for Loretta. She gets up, takes it off
the desk and falls back down into the bean bag.

                    BARRIS
          The Tammy Grimes Show is being pulled

                    BARRIS
          They want to put a prime-time version of
          the Dating Game on in its place.

                   LORETTA
          Shit! You're kidding!     That's fucking
          great!

                    BARRIS
          But they say the day-time version's not
          hot enough. They want me to make it more
          exciting for night-time. I got forty-
          eight hours.

                    LORETTA
          What do you have so far?

                    BARRIS
          Nothing. Bupkis. I mean, the show is
          what it is. I don't have a clue. This
          could be my big break, Loretta.

                    LORETTA
          Yeah, I know. Don't blow it.

Loretta smiles at him, downs her drink, gets up and pads out
of the office. Barris watches her ass.

                    BARRIS
          Thank you for your help.

                    LORETTA
              (not looking back)
          Hey, I brought the ice.

She is out the door.   Barris picks up his guitar and noodles
on it.

INT. DATING GAME SET - LATER

Barris paces on the darkened set. He is trying to think. A
shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps
down the aisle. Barris is deep in thought and doesn't hear.
The man appears behind Barris and locks his arm around
Barris's neck. Barris is startled, choking and flailing
trying to remove the arm. He can't. Finally the man
releases Barris and tweaks his crotch. Barris turns wildly
around. It is Jim Byrd.

                    BYRD
          Boy, didn't I teach you anything?

                    BARRIS
          You son of a bitch!

Barris swings at Byrd.   Byrd easily blocks the punch.

                    BYRD
          You're so rusty, it's embarrassing.

                    BARRIS
          You're a stupid fucking turd, you know
          that?

                    BYRD
          Can I buy you lunch?

INT. MARTONI'S - DAY

Jim is downing his bourbon and signals the waitress for
another. Barris, still pissed, sips a martini.

                    BYRD
          Ah, lighten up, hombre.

                    BARRIS
          My fucking neck hurts.    Okay?

                    BYRD
          Poor baby. Look, I've been put in charge
          of a fairly large wet operation and I
          could use your help.

                    BARRIS
          Have you noticed, Jim, I've got a tv show
          on the air? I don't need to kill people
          for hire anymore.

                    BYRD
          I know you don't need to.    But you'd like
          to.

                    BARRIS
          That's insane.

Byrd shrugs, unconvinced.    He sips his drink.

                    BYRD
          Think of it as a hobby. An avocation.
          Something you do to relax. You can be an
          assassination enthusiast, a murder bug.

             with you.

                       BYRD
             Okay, I'll help you out with your little
             show. Tit for tat. That's the kinda guy
             I am. I've seen this Dating Game of
             yours, Chuck. And I have a thought.

                       BARRIS
             What, now you're a television producer?

                    BYRD
          Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public
          when it comes to tv and that should make
          my opinion of interest to you.

                       BARRIS
             Let's hear it then.

                    BYRD
          Well, what do you have now? The couple
          gets sent to some stupid second-rate
          Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right?
          Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not
          too exciting a prize to us vicarious-
          living boobs out in TV-land.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, what's your point?

                    BYRD
          Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to
          some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast
          Asia, for example.

                    BARRIS
          The network's not going to let me send
          two unmarried kids on vacation together.

                    BYRD
              (shrugs)
          Send 'em with a chaperone. Some
          respectable old lady with a sewn closed
          snatch.

                    BARRIS
              (considering)
          Y'know, that's not half bad.

                    BYRD
          I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you
          can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say
          we have a job for you in Austria. You, a
          successful tv producer, above suspicion,
          chaperones the young couple, and while
          you're there, blam! you take care of some
          Company business. It's the perfect
          cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative
          by night.

                    BARRIS
          I told you, I don't have to kill people
          for money anymore.

                    BYRD
          Chuck, when I said you fit our profile,
          very little of that had to do with you
          needing the money. Some of it, but very
          little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck.
          I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but
          you botched it. Don't you want to get
          really good at something, Chuck?

Barris stares at Byrd.

INT. BOOTH (DATING GAME SHOW) - DAY

The director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back
watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty
blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three
bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and
stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not-
too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His
slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp
chatter in the booth.

                    DIRECTOR
              (rapidly)
          Ready one, take one. Ready three, take
          three. Ready one, take one.

                    BLONDE BACHELORETTE
          Number one, can you please tell me what a
          girl is like who hasn't been on a date
          before and how you can tell she hasn't
          been on a date before?

                    DIRECTOR
          Ready two, take two.   This guy has never
          been on a date.

Everyone in the booth laughs.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

            Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy.   This
            is just too good.

                      FAT BACHELOR
            ... I'll ask her what she likes to do and
            --

            Ready one, take one.   Ready two, take
            two.

                      FAT BACHELOR
            And if she doesn't know what she likes to
            do --

                      DIRECTOR
            Ready three, take three. The only date
            he's ever had is with his right hand.

Guys in booth laugh, except Barris.

                      FAT BACHELOR
            ... then I'll know she hasn't done it
            yet.

EXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS - DAY

SUBTITLE:    LONDON, 1967

It's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along,
taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde
bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she
thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention
whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and
Barris. Barris seems bored.

INT. PUB - DAY

Barris enters the pub alone. He's dressed in a blonde wig
and moustache and glasses. It's crowded and he searches the
room for someone. He spots a pretty young woman by herself
at a table. She wears white go-go boots.

                      BARRIS
            Excuse me, is this seat taken?

                      WOMAN
            By you.

Barris sits across from the woman.

                    BARRIS
          London is wonderful this time of year,
          isn't it.

                          WOMAN
          Yes it is.

                     BARRIS
              (beat)
          Oh. Sorry.

Barris gets up, glances around, spots another pretty young
woman in white go-go boots, sitting by herself. He
approaches her.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, is this seat taken?

                          PATRICIA
             By you.

Barris sits.

                       BARRIS
             London is wonderful this time of year,
             isn't it?

                       PATRICIA
             Especially the fog. It affords one
             solitude, even in a city full of people.

                          BARRIS
             I'm Chuck.

                       PATRICIA
             Yes, I gathered.

                       BARRIS
             And you are?

                       PATRICIA
                 (smiles)
             Here you go, Chuck.

She hands him a manila envelope, and stands to leave.

                    BARRIS
          At least give me a made-up name.
          Something for me to cry out during those
          dark nights of the soul.

          Very good, Chuck. I'm pleasantly
          surprised. You're not like the other
          murderers.

She smiles and leaves. Barris watches after her, then opens
the envelope and pulls out a black and white photo of a man.

EXT. WESTMINISTER ABBEY - DAY

It's raining. A bored Barris, dressed normally, waits with
the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance. The
fat bachelor checks his watch.

                    FAT BACHELOR
          I thinks he's really pretty and I want to
          be her boyfriend.

EXT. CHURCH COURTYARD - NIGHT

Barris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the
empty, dark courtyard.

                    ENGLISHMAN
              (loud whisper)
          Here.

Barris approaches.

                    BARRIS
          Do you have it?

                    ENGLISHMAN
          Do you have it?

                       BARRIS
          Sorry.     Yeah.

Barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an
envelope. The Englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad
of cash and counts.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.

                    ENGLISHMAN
          Just the same.

The Englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and
hands Barris a box of Polaroid film.

                       BARRIS
          Thank you.     Oh, one more thing.

Barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and
jams it into the Englishman's mouth. The silencer breaks the
man's front teeth. The man makes a muffled grunt.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Sorry about your teeth.

The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the
trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head
explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the
church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris
reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of
money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard
gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused.
After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          It's Ronnie, isn't it?

The fat bachelor nods.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you
          something neat. It's okay.

The fat bachelor enters the courtyard.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I
          did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor.
          He was ugly and fat and stupid. More
          life wouldn't have changed that for him.
          No woman would ever have loved him.
          That's just the brutal truth, y'know?

INT. LONDON HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris enters the room, shaky and scared.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barris rips open the Polaroid box, pulls out the foil paper
that protects the film, rips that open and pulls out a small
white plastic vial. Barris greases the vial with Vaseline
and sticks it up his ass.

He looks at himself in the mirror, naked and pathetic. There
is a knock at the door. He stiffens, grabs his gun and pads
out of the bathroom.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barris peeks out the peephole.   We see a fish-eye view of
Patricia Watson.

                     BARRIS
          Olivia?

                    PATRICIA
          It's Patricia, actually.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

Barris and Patricia sit sipping champagne.   Both are drunk.

                    PATRICIA
          ... and so then I spent a year in
          Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war
          movement as an agent provocateur, nudging
          it toward violence in order to discred
          it. That was fun. I got to wear granny
          glasses.

                    BARRIS
          Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd
          you come up here tonight?

                    PATRICIA
          I don't know. You're sort of cute in a
          homely way. And it's always lonely when
          that civilian you're fucking calls out
          the name off your fake passport.

                    BARRIS

          is from forged documents."

                     PATRICIA
          Nabokov.

Barris is thrilled and kisses her. It begins to turn hot and
heavy. Suddenly Barris pulls away.

                    BARRIS
          Actually, I just gotta go into the
          bathroom and take care of something.

EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

A plane lands.

INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT TERMINAL, CUSTOMS - DAY

Barris waits sweatily in line with a small a carry-on
suitcase. When the line moves, he walks as if perhaps he has
something up his ass. A customs agent walks past the line
with a dog. The dog sniffs Barris's ass in passing.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Barris steps out of the terminal. A black limo pulls up.
The back door opens and Barris gets in.

INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Seated in the back are Jim Byrd and Simon Oliver, 50. Oliver
is pure ivy league with a pipe. When he speaks it is with an
affected British accent. Byrd is pissy.

          contestant. Is that understood?

          Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in
          possession of my microfilm?

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, I got it.

                    OLIVER
          Let's have it then.

                    BARRIS
          It's up my ass, Oliver. Why don't you
          reach on up there and get it.

Oliver tamps his pipe.   Byrd stares down at his thumbs.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          I just feel I deserve some appreciation
          for my efforts.

                    OLIVER
          What do you think Patricia Watson was?

Barris looks at Byrd.    Byrd almost imperceptibly shakes his
head "no."

                      BARRIS
          Prick.

INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY

Barris, now in t-shirt and jeans, shuffles through the busy
bullpen area. Employees wave, say "hi", give Barris the
peace sign. He returns the gestures, but halfheartedly. He
seems depressed. Loretta sidles up beside him.

                    LORETTA
          Well, if isn't the hitman.

                    BARRIS
              (turning, wild-eyed)
          What?

                      OFFICE WORKERS
          Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!   Hitman!

                    LORETTA
          I said, well, if it isn't the hitman.
          Just heard through the grapevine that ABC
          is going to pick up The Newlywed Game.

                    BARRIS
          You're kidding me.

                    LORETTA
          Not kidding you. Day-time and prime-
          time.

                    BARRIS
          Oh, fuck, Loretta.     That's sensational!

Barris kisses Loretta.

                      OFFICE WORKERS
          Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!

Barris joins them chanting "Hitman" and dances around the
office.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          The Newlywed Game was based on my theory
          that almost any American would sell out
          their spouse for a washer-drier or a
          lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my
          respect for that most holy of unions. I
          must've been on to something, because the
          show aired for thirteen years.

EXT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - DAY

Barris speeds through the curvy streets of the Hollywood
Hills. Penny Pacino, dressed as a hippy, sits in the front
passenger seat.

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD HILLS, 1969

                    PENNY
          Great wheels, man.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, I decided to start treating myself
          right. You spend so much time denying
          yourself things. Life's too short.

                    PENNY
          Yeah, I really gork what you're saying,
          man.

                    BARRIS
          You really grok what I'm saying, man.
          Not gork.

                       PENNY
          Oh.
              (beat)
          Really?

The car screeches to a halt in front of a fancy house with a
"For Sale, Open House" sign out front.

INT. FANCY HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The house is empty. Barris and Penny are greeted at the door
by a real estate agent.

                    PENNY
              (looking around)
          Outa sight! Buy this one.

                    REAL ESTATE AGENT
          Hi. Welcome, folks. If you wouldn't
          mind signing-in on our sheet over th --

                    BARRIS
          I'll take it.

                       REAL ESTATE AGENT
          I'm sorry?

                    BARRIS
          I'll take the house.

                       PENNY
          Yay!

Penny happily kisses Barris.

                     REAL ESTATE AGENT
              (beat)
          Very good, sir.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barris and Penny are having sex on the floor.

                    PENNY
          So, man, are you seeing anyone?

                    BARRIS
          Nobody serious. You?


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.

                     PENNY
          No.   I think we should get married.

                    BARRIS
          Aw, Pen, don't start --

                    PENNY
          No, listen, it makes sense. You and I
          feel exactly the same about marriage,
          right? How much bullshit it is, right?
          And the odds of us finding someone else
          with the exact same view on it are small.
          So, it makes sense.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris, 50, types away. He is sweaty and naked except for a
towel draped over his head.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          I liked Penny. I even loved her in my
          way. But the idea of tying myself down
          for the rest of my life... I remember my
          parents' marriage.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CHILDHOOD KITCHEN - NIGHT

Barris, five, sits at the dinner table with his parents. His
father, dressed in a dental smock, stares down at his plate
as he eats. His mother absently chews and stares vacantly
into space.

                    MOTHER
          We need a new ice box.

The father shrugs.

INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY

The set, which holds four couples, divides in the middle to
reveal a new refrigerator.

                    ANNOUNCER
          A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer
          with automatic ice maker!

One of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically,
happy and in love and kissing. The other couples look
disappointed and angry at their spouses.

We pull back to reveal we're watching this on a tv in:

                                                              61.



INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - MORNING

The office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like
employees watching The Newlywed Game. Many sit on the floor,
jammed up against each other. A few women are nursing
infants. Someone passes a joint. Barris sits behind his
desk, with a "Make Love Not War" helmet on his head, his feet
up, and a guitar in his lap.

                    BARRIS
          Beautiful. Did you see that? How much
          they loved each other just then? That's
          what it's all about, kiddies.

Everyone agrees.   Someone switches off the tv.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Okay, guys, new business. We're winning
          our slots every week.

Everyone cheers.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          But that means we need you Bandits to get
          on the contestant mill. Our supply of
          dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand
          for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be
          introducing three new shows in the coming
          months: The Parent Game, The Game Game,
          and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty
          Pageant, so we're gonna really need you
          guys to carry your weight. Nuff said.
          Any other business?

                    EMPLOYEE #1
          Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at
          lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got
          two.

                      BARRIS
          Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are
          you?

                      RICK
          Here.    No, it's not true.

                    BARRIS
          Any other witnesses to this alleged
          infraction?

                      EMPLOYEE #2
          I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one.

          I sentence you to... dance for us in
          today's post-meeting version of "Out of
          Limits" featuring the musical stylings of
          the CBP Stompers.

Everyone cheers.

                       RICK
          Aw, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Get up here, you rascule, you.

Rick heads up to Barris's desk. Everyone laughs. A few
employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments.
They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits."
Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping.

MONTAGE

As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see
montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various
foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut
with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different
bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in
various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many
game shows, happily directing the bustling activity.

INT. RANCH-STYLE LIVING ROOM - DAY

The actual Jim Lange, host of The Dating Game.

                    JIM LANGE
          Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for
          weeks. I remember once we had a conflict
          on the set over the right way to throw
          that kiss at the end of the show,
          y'know...
              (demonstrates kiss)
          ... and Chuck was just not reachable to
          resolve it.

                    INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          What was the conflict?

                    JIM LANGE
          Look, it's water under the bridge.     I'm
          not gonna talk about it.

                                                          63.



INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The previously bare room is now filled with lovely and
expensive furnishings. But Barris and Penny are again on the
floor, now playing Scrabble by candlelight. Penny lays down
some tiles: I-N-T-E-R-P-E-T

                    BARRIS
          The word's interpret.

                        PENNY
          Interpet.

                        BARRIS
          Interpret.

                    PENNY
          Well, do you have an extra "r" then I
          could borrow?

                    BARRIS
          I'm not going to give you a letter.
          You're lucky I don't make you forfeit a
          turn.

                        PENNY
          Oh.   Okay.

Penny retrieves her letters and studies the board. Barris
empties the wine into Penny's glass. There wasn't much left.

                    BARRIS
          I'll run to the store and get some more.

                        PENNY
          All right.

                    BARRIS
          Don't cheat.

                    PENNY
          You neither.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Barris pulls up in a Jaguar XKE convertible. A pretty,
innocent-looking young woman, Monica, is emerging with a big
laundry bag from the laundromat next to the liquor store.
She glances, momentarily, at the Jaguar and at Barris.

                                                              64.



INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER

Barris enters with a bottle of wine.   Penny is in the same
position on the floor.

                    PENNY
          Intrepet's a word, right?

                      BARRIS
          Intrepid.

                    PENNY
          Shit fuck piss.
              (concentrating)
          Okay okay okay...

                    BARRIS
          Pen, we should call it a night.     I'm
          kinda tired.

                    PENNY
          You're tired.

                    BARRIS
          I got a date.

                    PENNY
          Since when?

                    BARRIS
          I just met this girl.

                    PENNY
                                Like, just now ?
          You mean just now?

                      BARRIS
          Yeah.    Kinda.

                    PENNY
          Well, that's rude.

                      BARRIS
          Sorry.

                    PENNY
          Yeah, well, see ya...

Penny picks up her bag and exits in a huff.

INT. MONICA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

It's a young woman's apartment, small and girly.    The
doorbell rings.

Monica, clearly not out of her teens, enters the room and
answers the door. Barris stands there with the bottle of
wine.

Barris enters, looks around. There's another teenage girl in
pajamas in the kitchenette, mixing tuna salad.

          Hi.

                    MONICA
          Have a seat.

Barris sits on the couch. Monica sits next to him. Mindy is
in the background, futzing around in the kitchen area.

                    MONICA (CONT'D)
          So... have you accepted the Lord Jesus
          Christ as your savior, Chuck?

          Yes, I have.

Barris, Monica, and Mindy sit on the couch watching a
religious show on television.

                     ACTUAL BARRIS
          Yeah, I remember that religious girl,
          sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh
          God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam
          I ever experienced. It took a little
          more work than usual, but I got in there,
          baby.
              (smacks lips, then stares off
                into space)
          It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get
          old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam,
          it just doesn't go away. This is the
          great tragedy of getting old.

INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY

The room is abuzz with activity. Lots of people on the phone
talking. A potential Newlywed Game couple being interviewed.
Monica sits in the waiting area, eavesdrops on the interview
with the Newlywed Couple.

                     WOMAN
          Getting married to Alan is the best thing
          I've ever done. It's just so wonderful
          knowing that you've got someone by your
          side through everything for he rest of
          your life.

The couple kisses.

          'kay, Mon.     He's off.

Monica enters the office.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Monica enters.   Barris wears a deerstalker cap.

                    BARRIS
          My sweet little clamato.

Monica leans down and kisses Barris.

                    MONICA
          I'm pregnant.

Barris's eye twitches.

Monica looks at him incredulously, flings an ashtray at him,
misses. She sits at the desk, looks glumly out the window.

                    MONICA
          I can't believe you asked me that.

          How?    Are you gonna marry me?

                    BARRIS
              (carefully)
          Well, no. Not at this point.

                    MONICA
          I'm not murdering my baby!
              (weeping)
          I can't... do that. Please...

Barris sighs.    He touches Monica's hand.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Barris and Monica sit in first class. Barris stares out the
window. Monica stares straight ahead.

                    BARRIS
          Beautiful country, isn't it?

EXT. MEXICAN ALLEY - DAY

Barris leads a crying Monica down the garbage-strewn alley.
They find a doorway. Barris opens it.

                    BARRIS
          Here we are.

Barris supports her and leads her into the office.

                       BARRIS
          It's okay.     It'll be okay.

EXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN, UCLA - DAY

Barris and Penny walk sadly through the garden.

                    PENNY
          What a waste.

                    BARRIS
          Tell me about it. I figure over the
          years I must've spent close to twenty
          grand on these abortions: airfare,
          hotels, doctors, gifts.

                    PENNY
          That's not what I meant.

                    BARRIS
          And I don't even know how many of these
          fetuses were mine. That's what really
          kills me.

          Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for
          it. He was a wallet with legs.

          Yeah, I was just a kid.   It ruined my

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          I don't really want to talk about this.

We hold on a silent Barris.

EXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY

Barris and Penny walk in silence.

                    PENNY
          So I'm assuming this means Monica is out
          of the picture.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.

                    PENNY
          Chuck, I was thinking... I have this
          plan now, now that you're free --

                    BARRIS
          God, you look cute today.

                    PENNY
          I always look cute. Don't distract me.
          What was I going to say?

                    BARRIS
          I don't know.

                    PENNY
          You do know.
              (enthusiastically charged)
          Chuck, why don't we get married? We've
          known each other forever. We've fucked
          each other forever. You think I'm cute,
          you just said. You always come to me
          when you're in trouble. And you're
          almost forty, Chuck.

Barris turns violently toward Penny.

                    BARRIS
              (shouting)
          I know how old I almost am! That's it.
          Don't ever ask me to marry you again!

                    PENNY
              (quietly)
          I won't.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Barris and Penny are having sex. It is gentle and quiet.
Penny is crying, trying to conceal it. Barris notices.

                    BARRIS
          I'm sorry I yelled at you today, Pen.

                    PENNY
          I'm not crying because you yelled at me.
          This is it, isn't it? This is us.

Barris studies Penny's face in the dim light.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris puffs on his cigar.

                       ACTUAL BARRIS
             I almost asked Penny to marry me right
             then. But I didn't.

INT. SEEDY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris sits naked on the bed, swigging from a bottle of
vodka, as a prostitute in a black dress and veil sings "Happy
Birthday" to him. When she's done, she lifts the veil, looks
confused.

                    PROSTITUTE
          Is that right?

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY

Barris sits staring out the window. His mood is somber. On
the table beside him are many birthday cards. The anarchic
and youthful decor of the office seems to mock Barris now.
Loretta enters.

                       LORETTA
          Chuck?

Flexner enters.    He's a suit.

                      FLEXNER
          Chuck!    Great to see you.

                    BARRIS
          What's up, Rod?

                    FLEXNER
          Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your
          shows aren't doing too well in the old
          ratings war. The Family Game, for one.

                       BARRIS
          Okay.

We move into Barris's eyes.

INT. FAMILY GAME SET

The show is in progress. Suddenly shots are fired from
offstage. The host and contestants are slaughtered. It's
bloody and violent.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY

We're on Barris's eyes.

                    FLEXNER
          And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite
          frankly, in the toilet, Chuck.

INT. HOW'S YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW SET

A mother-in-law is being garotted with piano wire.   Her neck
is sliced. Blood spurts.

                                                             72.

Dream Girls lie bloody and flailing all over the set.

                    FLEXNER
          And The Game Game has no life in it at
          all.

INT. GAME GAME SET

The contestants on the set are all bloody and dead. An
applause light flashes on and off, but the audience members
are also dead.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY

                    FLEXNER
          So I've been put in the unfortunate
          position of having to inform you that the
          network is canceling all four of these
          shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm
          just the messenger.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris drinks alone.   He's sullen and sauced.

                    BARRIS
              (to bartender)
          They killed my babies. Just like that.
          I pushed them into the world through the
          birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly.
          Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these
          people?

                    BARTENDER
          The fucking bastards.

                    BARRIS
          What am I gonna do now?
              (sees pretty woman)
          Hey there, can I buy you a drink?

              (screaming)
          Fuck you!

The large man stands to face Barris. He is very large.
Barris stands. The man swings at Barris. Barris easily
deflects the punch, grabs the man's forearm and breaks it
with a sickening crack. The man screams. Barris gets him in
a chokehold from behind. The man whimpers and gags.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Let's see, if I remember correctly, the
          next move breaks your neck, which kills
          you instantly or paralyzes you.
          Depending on your luck.

                     LARGE MAN
          Please.

                    BARRIS
              (lets go)
          Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece
          of shit dog-shit shithead.

The large man hurries from the bar. Everyone in the bar,
including the large man's date, watches Barris.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (to the woman)
          Hi. I'm Chuck Barris, tv producer.   Have

INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barris and the woman from the bar are having sex on the
couch. Penny enters.

Penny sees Barris and the woman.

                    PENNY
          This is our house, man. Our house! It's
          one thing to go elsewhere for your pussy
          needs. But this is our house!

                    BARRIS
          This is not our house, it's my house.

                    PENNY
          It's our house! I found it with you. I
          decorated it for you! I spent six months
          sitting on that fucking couch she's
          fucking you on, fucking waiting for the
          fucking plumbers to come! God, you are
          such an asshole!

Penny throws the house key at Barris. It hits him in the
forehead. Then she turns and storms from the house. Barris
looks over at the woman. She looks confused.

                    WOMAN
          I should go. This doesn't feel right.

The woman stands, grabs her purse, pulls out an 8x10 glossy
of herself and hands it to Barris, then exits. Barris stares
at the photo for a moment, then opens a drawer and puts on
top of a pile of similar photos.

EXT. PENNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Barris pulls up, gets out of his car, and heads toward the
building.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Barris walks down the hall, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
He arrives at Penny's door. There is an envelope attached to
it with Barris's name on it. He opens the envelope and reads
the letter.

         Dear Chuck,
         I'm dead now. I hope you're happy.
         The door's open.
                            Love always,
                               Penny

Barris hurriedly opens the door, enters the apartment looks
around, finds Penny face down on the floor, surrounded by
empty champagne bottles and vials of pills. He stares at her
body for a moment, feeling faint. He drops to his knees.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

Barris and Penny sit in a booth. Penny has black coffee in
front of her. She is pale and drawn.

                       PENNY
             Why were you with that girl in our living
             room?

                       BARRIS
             It's not our living room, Pen.

                       PENNY
             That's your defense?   You know what it
             feels like to see you with someone else?
             In any living room.

                    BARRIS
          You know who I am, Penny.    I don't force
          you to hang around.

                    PENNY
              (incredulous)
          You don't force me?   Fuck. So you're
          saying you have no interest in this, one
          way or the other?

                    BARRIS
          No, I'm not saying that.

                    PENNY
          Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck?
          Do you want me around or not? Do you
          even like me?

                    BARRIS
          Of course I like you.

          I don't even know what that means, "how
          much?" How can I rate a person in that
          way? That's ridiculous.

                    PENNY
          You could if you felt it. If you felt
          it, it would be easy to rate me. You
          could spread your arms as wide as they
          would go and say, "This much, Penny."

                    BARRIS
          Everything's complicated, Pen.    Nothing's
          black and white like that.

                    PENNY
          Do you want me around or not? If you
          don't, just say so, so I know. Okay?

Barris and Penny look at each other.    She starts to cry.

                    BARRIS
          I love you, Pen, in my way. Maybe not in
          that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but
          what is that, anyway? Romantic love.
          Isn't that just an illusion?

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

A non-descript American car is parked on the quiet wooded
street. Barris pulls up in his Jaguar. He gets out of the
car, looks in the window of the empty American car.

                    BYRD (O.S.)
          Over here, Strawberry-dick.

Barris looks over and makes out Byrd sitting on a rock with a
view of L.A. spread out in front of him. Barris joins him.

          Jesus, how do you know these things?

          beautiful... West Berlin!

The couple screams excitedly by reflect, but as the
destination sinks in, their perplexity becomes apparent.

EXT. WEST BERLIN STREET - DAY

Barris and the Dating Game couple walk along. It's cold and
gray and they all wear heavy coats. The couple wear cameras
around their necks. Nobody looks happy.

INT. BEER HALL - NIGHT

Barris sits in the corner of this noisy, smoky place. He has
a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken
Germans in the background sing a song. Patricia Watson
approaches and sits. Barris looks up and smiles.

                       BARRIS
          Treesh.

                    PATRICIA
          Leibchen.
              (kisses him, sits)
          So, here's what we got.   Name's Hans
          Colbert.
              (pulls out photos)
          Other side of the wall.   We don't like
          him very much.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             78.

                    BARRIS
              (singing Toot-toot-tootsie)
          Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye.

                    PATRICIA
          You'll work with a kraut named Keeler.
          He's been trailing Colbert for a month
          now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a
          drunk, so you stay sober and take charge.

                    BARRIS
              (collecting photos)
          Done and done. See you after?

                    PATRICIA
          Prove how much you love me, baby.   Kill
          for me. Then I'm all yours.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Barris crawls through a long dirt tunnel. Telephone cables
run along the floor. An occasional bare bulb lights the way.

INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY

A middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and
shaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing
a hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at
the shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a
change of clothes, and continues shaving.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes. We
see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background. A
car pulls up and Barris gets in.

INT. CAR, RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Barris sits in the parked car with Keeler, a heavyset, silent
German man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth. He is
constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook. There is
a long silence.

                    BARRIS
          What you writing, Sig?

                    KEELER
          I am keeping track of all the goings on
          on this street.

Barris looks out the window. There is nothing going on, yet
Keeler keeps writing. More silence.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            79.
CONTINUED:


                    BARRIS
          Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by.

                     KEELER
          Yah.   I know how to do my job.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PARKED CAR - NIGHT

Barris and Keeler are still in the car. Keeler continues to
smoke and write. A well-rested, happy-looking Colbert walks
by with a group of people.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PARKED CAR - AFTERNOON

Barris looks even more sickly. Colbert rides by happily on a
tandem bike with a lovely woman on the back. Keeler
continues to smoke and write.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PARKED CAR - EVENING

Barris and Keeler wait in the car. Colbert emerges from his
house, alone, and walks toward the car. A drained Barris
sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected
force, Keeler swings open the passenger door. The door hits
a stunned Colbert and sends him flying. Keeler races around
the car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and
jumps on top of him. Barris watches, surprised at the
dramatic personality shift in Keeler. Keeler is strangling
Colbert. A cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as
he does this. Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him,
so he can watch him die.

                    KEELER
              (calmly to Barris)
          Under the seat, please.

Barris reaches under the seat, pulls out a Polaroid camera.

                    KEELER (CONT'D)
          Please, if you don't mind, a photograph.
          To remember.

Barris is stunned, scared. He takes the photo. The flash
illuminates the bulging-eyed Colbert and the calm Keeler.

                                                             80.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Barris types.   A knock at the door.   He looks up, panicked.

                     BARRIS
              (falsetto)
          Who is it?

                    HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.)
          Housekeeping, Mr. Barris.

Barris looks around. The place is a disaster. Food
wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing,
plastic army men set up for battle. He gets up, puts on a
hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the
peephole for a long moment, and answers the door. The
housekeeper is plump and kind-looking.

                    BARRIS
          Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.

                    HOUSEKEEPER
              (looking around)
          Another rough night, huh?

                    BARRIS
              (tapping his head)
          The human psyche is a wondrous thing.

                    HOUSEKEEPER
              (smiling maternally)
          Yes, I know it is.
              (taking gun)
          We don't need this now, do we?    Why don't
          we just put this away?

She puts the gun in a drawer, starts to pick up.   Barris
watches her, then:

                    BARRIS
          Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your
          bosom for a little while?

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very
          good idea, Mr. Barris.

                    BARRIS
          I'm sorry. You're right. I just... I'm
          just without... comfort of any sort, and
          I... please forgive me.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                81.
CONTINUED:


                    HOUSEKEEPER
              (smiles at him)
          No harm done.

Barris smacks himself in the head.

                    BARRIS
              (bowing)
          Thank you. Thank you.      Thank you.   You
          are a scholar and...

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          It's fine, sir.

                    BARRIS
          Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God
          thinks of someone like me?

                      HOUSEKEEPER
          God?

                      BARRIS
          Yes, God.

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows
          have brought laughter and joy to millions
          of people. That's a very important
          thing, I think, in these difficult times.
          I would imagine God likes you very much.

Barris smiles a rubber-band smile.

                    BARRIS
          Thank you, that's very kind.
              (glances at her ample bosom)
          So... I should get back to...

                    HOUSEKEEPER
          Yes, of course, sir. Don't mind me.

Barris resumes typing.   The housekeeper cleans.

EXT. EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

A hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals
the tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the
quiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of
the building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a
car. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He
glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment
building. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      82.
CONTINUED:

The car drives away. Barris stops at the end of the block,
stares at the imposing wall.

                    BARRIS
          I'm really, really fucked.

Another car pulls up next to him. Picard, a        serious-looking
Frenchman, sticks his head out the window.

                         PICARD
          Get in.

                         BARRIS
          What?       Who the hell are you?

                        PICARD
          No time.      Get in or die.

Barris hesitates, gets in.        The car screeches off.

INT. PICARD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Picard drives fast. Barris eyes him suspiciously, fingers
his gun. Picard spots a Fiat in his rearview mirror.

                    PICARD
          Merde. KGB. They know who you are,
          Monsieur Barris. It is their intention
          to kill you very much in East Berlin.

Barris checks in the passenger side mirror.

                        BARRIS
             Merde!   MERDE!
                    PICARD
          Not to worry, my friend.

Picard speeds up dramatically, but continues to drive calmly.
Barris is agitated.

                    PICARD (CONT'D)
          I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to
          meet you. Do not worry, I am not KGB.            I
          do not want to kill you, I want you to
          live a long happy life and have many
          dancing grandchildren to admire.

Picard screeches around a corner, then another one.            He's
lost the Fiat, for the moment.

                                                             83.



EXT. QUIET EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

Picard's car stops at the curb. Picard and Barris emerge.
Picard opens the trunk. He lifts out a big folded-up clump
of rubber with a an engine mounted on it.

                    BARRIS
          What the hell is that?

                    PICARD
          Your ride, Monsieur Barris.

Picard unfolds the rubber mass. He pulls a cord and it
begins to inflate. It is an airplane, a one person
inflatable plane.

                    BARRIS
          No fucking way.

                    PICARD
          It's quite reliable and easy to operate.
          It will get you over the wall. Or you
          can stay here. In the German Democratic
          Republic. I will arrange for you to get
          a good factory job. No, you must fly,
          like Daedalus before you, to the freedom
          of the west.

                     BARRIS
          Christ.   What about you?

                    PICARD
          They do not catch me, monsieur. This is
          my talent, to get away always. In
          guerre. In amour. This is my talent,
          and perhaps this is my curse.

EXT. BERLIN WALL - DAY

The fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street,
dipping and rising erratically. The noise is deafening.
Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified.    He
approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it.
The plane is shot by a soldier. Air hisses out.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Barris sits on a park bench.   Jim Byrd approaches, sits.

                    BYRD
              (chuckling)
          So, did you have a nice flight?


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                84.
CONTINUED:


                       BARRIS
             Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.

                       BYRD
             Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were
             up to. You were there to kill Colbert,
             they were there to kill you. I'm
             thinking we got a mole. So much hate in
             the world, Chuck.

                       BARRIS
             Am I in danger still?

                       BYRD
             Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of
             business since yesterday, so far as I
             know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main
             concern should be: if they know who you
             are, they know who I am.

                          BARRIS
             Fuck off.     What do we do?

                       BYRD
             Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna
             do. You're lucky you have another career
             to immerse yourself in.

INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY

Barris sits with a several network executive and some other
staff members watching a fat man tap dance badly and, because
of his weight, extremely loudly. It's painful for everybody
to watch. The fat man finishes.

                          BARRIS
             Thank you.     Thanks.   That was great.

The fat smiles and exits.       Barris puts his head in his hands.

                       EXECUTIVE WOMAN
             I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak.

                       BARRIS
             There's gotta be somebody in America with
             some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every
             week.

The executives look at each other.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
             Bring in the next thing.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


An assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale
blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows
enters with a guitar. She begins to sing a folk song, very
sincerely, in a very off-key monotone. It's unbearable and
depressing. Barris glances over at the executive; she's
checking her watch again. The song is endless.    Barris's
eyes grow cloudy.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FIELD - DAY

This is the same field where Renda was shot. Now, the
folksinging woman is in the field singing. Barris pulls out
a gun and aims it at the woman. Her eyes widen in terror,
but she keeps singing. A church bell chimes and Barris
shoots her. She flies back, spurting blood. Her guitar hits
the ground with a twang.

INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY

Barris snaps out of his fantasy with renewed energy      The
folksinger is still droning on.

                    BARRIS
              (ushering out)
          Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in
          touch. That was wonderful.

Barris closes the door behind the folksinger and turns to the
executives.

                        BARRIS (CONT'D)
             We've been going about this all wrong.
             Rather than killing ourselves trying to
             find good acts, we just book bad ones and
             kill them.

                    EXECUTIVE #2
          Chuck, it's torture to sit through even
          one of these people --

                    BARRIS
          We kill 'em before they're through. As
          soon as it gets unbearable, we kill 'em.
          Dead.

                       EXECUTIVE WOMAN
             For God's sake, what are you talking
             about?

                    BARRIS
          Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the
          act... to kill 'em. And when you kill
          something, it stops. This I know to be
          true.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Barris and some suits watch from the booth as an octogenarian
woman on stage sings "Born Free" in an impossibly high voice.
Jamie Farr gongs the woman. The woman is angry. A vacuous
host with great hair appears next to the woman. He seems
genuinely agitated.

                       HOST
             Why'd you do that, Jamie? This is
             someone's grandmother. She was really
             trying.

                       JAMIE FARR
             This is The Gong Show, not the Van
             Cliburn eliminations.

                       HOST
             This is a human being with aspirations.
                    BARRIS
              (muttering)
          Oh, fuck me. This guy sucks.     He's
          bringing everyone down.

The executives eye each other.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          None of the hosts are getting it, Chuck.
          But we have a thought.

                         BARRIS
             What?

                         EXECUTIVE WOMAN
             You host.

All the executives smile at Barris.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You get it. And we believe your awkward,
          non-professional, mumbling persona is
          exactly right for the show.

                       BARRIS
             I don't want to be on tv.

          these test shows. Do it, Chuck, or we
          advise the network to pull it.

INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - NIGHT

Barris switches on the lights, walks through the empty
bullpen area to his office, unlocks the door, enters.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Barris enters, stares out the window, looks at himself in a
full-length mirror.

                    BARRIS
              (stiff)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong
          Show! I'm your host, Chuck Barris!
              (turns away in disgust)
          Ucchhh.

Barris sits behind his desk, draws a line down a piece of
paper and writes "Pros" and "Cons" at the top of the page.
He thinks. Under "Pros" he writes "Become National
Celebrity", "Get More Attention from Stewardesses", "Even
more women will want to have sex with me". Under "Cons" he
writes: "Easier target for KGB." He gets up, paces.
Suddenly, a shot rings out. It comes through the window and
shatters the mirror.   Barris dives to the floor. More
shots, crazy relentless shooting. Barris crawls on his belly
to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian
blinds just as another shot whizzes through. The blinds
explode. The shooting stops He waits on the floor, shaking
like a leaf. He pulls the list off his desk and writes under
"Pro": "I need another hit before I die."

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Center-stage is empty.   The band begins to play.   The studio
audience cheers.

                    ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          And now, here's the host and star of our
          show, Chuck Barris!

The curtain rises. Barris appears in a tuxedo coat, denim
work shirt, cowboy boots and a hat pulled down over his eyes.

                    BARRIS
          Welcome to The Gong Show. Here's an
          esoteric act if there ever was one.
          Ephemeral. It's an ephemeral act.

                     BARRIS (CONT'D)
           One that should get us our Emmy. Do we
           have an Emmy? We don't? Well this
           should get us one. Anyway, ladies and
           gentlemen... Big Nose!

Big Nose leaps onto stage. He is skinny, wearing a flowered
shirt and a sarong, and playing a toy flute while dancing in
ladies platform shoes. Suddenly he drops his flute, rips off
his sarong, revealing polka-dotted boxer shorts and a yellow
leotard. He rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins
crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers.

Barris watches from the wings, mesmerized. Big Nose is
gonged. Barris dances out onto stage to join him.

                           BIG NOSE
             Why?   Why?     Why?

                       BARRIS
             I don't know. I don't understand.

Barris glances out into the audience. Something glints. Is
it a gun. He starts to sweat. Jaye P. Morgan is saying
something about Big Nose. But we can't understand it. The
audience laughs. Barris continues to scan the audience.
Someone in headphones signals Barris from behind a camera.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
                 (to Big Nose)
             Well, win a few, lose a few.
                 (to audience)
             We'll be back with more stuff... right
             after this message.

Barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin. He
watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians
and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie
Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys
in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. Barris
turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every
movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. The
chanting continues, louder and more distorted. The faces in
the audience turn grotesque. Barris sweats profusely, his
breathing becomes more and more shallow. Suddenly his eyes
roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor,
unconscious.

DAILY NEWS: GONG HO!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

We see Barris in bed, hooked up to machines The executive
woman sits by his bed showing him the headlines.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          You can't quit.

                    BARRIS
          I can't quit? But I get panicky, Louise,
          in front of all those people.

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          You lack confidence, that's all.

                    BARRIS
          I lack confidence?

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          But we'll take care of that. We'll get
          you some confidence powder. Leave that
          to us.

          Confidence powder?

                    EXECUTIVE WOMAN
          Nose candy, Chuck. Blow. Snow.        Flake.

The curtain rises. A young man with a square of Plexiglass
in his hands, presses his lips against the Plexiglass and
blows. It makes a farting noise and allows to the audience
to see inside his mouth.

INT. WINGS - CONTINUOUS

Barris snorts some cocaine. We hear the act and audience
"booing" and yelling "Gong him!" in the background.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The actual Jaye P. Morgan is being interviewed.

                    ACTUAL JAYE P. MORGAN
          Chuck was real different on stage and
          off. Very tense. He was always looking
          over his shoulder. Even when we were
          fucking. Sort of an enigma.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Barris dances onstage with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine.

INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY

The actual Gene Gene is being interviewed.

                    GENE GENE
          Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde.
          Sometimes nice as you please. Give you
          the shirt off his back. Other times he'd
          rant like a crazy man. I remember once
          he screamed at me that I didn't know
          anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he
          yelled, "now there was a dancer!"

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

A black guy with weird teeth and a speech impediment attempts
stand-up. He looks petrified.

                    BLACK COMEDIAN
          Today I had a bad day today...

The audience yells "How bad was it?"   This throws the
performer. Finally he continues.

                    BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
          It was so bad, my wife didn't even know
          how to cook.

          That barracuda took an egg, put it in a
          pot of water, and burned the water. We
          had to rush that to the hospital.

The audience boos.

                    BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
          My mother-in-law...

The booing continues. The comedian can't take it. He looks
disoriented. He turns away from the audience and puts his
head in his hands. Jamie Farr gongs him.

EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

The actual Jamie Farr sits next to the pool. In the
background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses
splashing around in the water.

                    JAMIE FARR
          Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy.
          I think he was very saddened that the
          public saw him as this sort of spastic
          moron. I remember at the time I was
          reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just
          thrilled to have someone else in addition
          to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff
          with.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Barris lies in bed next to Patricia. It's 12:30 AM. He's
chatting on the phone, lazily twirling the cord. Patricia
reads.

                    BARRIS
          Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that
          language does not exist without an
          outward criteria.

                    JAMIE FARR (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          Certainly.  Wittgenstein said as much in
          Investigations. But if you read Ryle
          carefully --

                    PATRICIA
              (looking at clock)
          Chuck...

                    BARRIS
          Can we pick up tomorrow?




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                92.
CONTINUED:


                    JAMIE FARR
          Yeah. But consider my thinking on
          elementary propositions. I'm serious.

                     BARRIS
          Will do.   Love ya.

                    JAMIE FARR
          Right back at ya, amigo.

Barris hangs up. Patricia kisses him.       She pulls away.

                    PATRICIA
          I'm concerned about you. I think you
          need to get back into the life. Our sex
          was always amazing after you killed.
          Truth is you're not that great after your
          discussions with Jamie Farr.

The phone rings.

                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
          Oh, c'mon.

                    BARRIS
              (picks up)
          Jamie, I can't talk anymore tonight --

                     KEELER (O.S.)
               (telephone voice)
          This is Siegfried Keeler.     I need to see
          you.

Barris jerks up, surprised, alarmed.       Patricia watches him.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          Assassins do not fraternize. That Keeler
          was calling me could mean it was my turn
          to get hit.

                    KEELER (O.S.)
              (phone voice)
          I am in town on business, Chuck. And I
          desire nothing more than your company for
          dinner. I consider you one of my closest
          friends.

                    BARRIS
          Sure. Dinner sounds good. There's a
          place called La Scala. See you there at
          eight.

Barris hangs up.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            93.

                    PATRICIA
              (eyes closed)
          Dinner sounds good with whom?

                    BARRIS
          Keeler.

Patricia glances over at Barris.   They stare at each other.

EXT. LA SCALA PARKING LOT - EVENING

Barris pulls into the parking lot. As he waits for the valet
parking attendant to get to him, he adjusts the gun strapped
to his ankle.

INT. LA SCALA - EVENING

Barris enters the crowded restaurant, looks around, spots
Keeler sitting at a table in the rear. As he makes his way
back, Barris shakes hands and says hello to several early
seventies tv celebrities scattered throughout the restaurant:
Carrol O'Connor, Joanne Worley, Flip Wilson, Ron Palillo.
Barris arrives at Keeler's table. Keeler rises and embraces
Chuck. He's already drunk. They sit.

                    KEELER
          A very fancy place.

                    BARRIS
          Only the best for my friend.

                    KEELER
          The friendships one develops during
          wartime are remarkably strong.

                    BARRIS
          Yes.

There is an awkward silence.

                    KEELER
          So how is the business of television?

Barris, pleased to have something to talk about, rambles.

                    BARRIS
          Well, it's hit and miss. I've got a new
          show called "Operation Entertainment"
          which I believe is going to kill. It's
          sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops
          thing, but it's weekly and...

Keeler is staring right through Barris.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            94.

                    KEELER
          Why do you do what you do, Chuck?

                    BARRIS
          Well, I like to think that I bring joy
          and laughter to millions of people. I'm
          not saying that my shows are as good as
          they could be. Yet. But --

                    KEELER
          Why do you kill?

Barris looks around, clears his throat.

                       BARRIS
          Oh.

                    KEELER
          During the second world war, I had the
          pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I
          found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I
          could find nothing else to fill me so
          much with life. So I became what I am
          today. I wanted the exhiliration
          again... of death.

The waiter appears.

                    WAITER
          Are you gentlemen ready to order?

                    KEELER
          I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green
          salad.

                    WAITER
          And for you, sir.

                    KEELER
          Um, Just give me a steak.    Rare.

                       WAITER
          Thank you.

The waiter leaves.    Keeler sips his drink, stares at Barris.

                    KEELER
          "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
          with thy whole might. Work while it is
          called, for the night cometh wherein no
          man can work."

                    BARRIS
          That's Carlyle!

                       KEELER
          Yes.

                    BARRIS
          It's amazing you should quote him.   He's
          my hero.

                     KEELER
          I read in a book recently that killing
          your first man is like making love to
          your first woman. Every smell, every
          nuance, you remember with a special
          allure, as if the acts had occured
          outside civilization, outside time. And
          when the allure is gone, you are
          condemned.

                       BARRIS
          Condemned?

                    KEELER
          I am condemned to live the rest of my
          life outside civilization. You will be
          too, my good friend.

Barris looks into Keeler's hollow eyes.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris puffs on his cigar.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          The next day I heard Keeler offed
          himself.

EXT. L.A. HOTEL - NIGHT

Keeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)
          You never really know in the world of
          espionage if something labeled a suicide
          actually is a suicide. But he was dead.
          That I knew.

INT. MARTONI'S - NIGHT

Barris eats dinner with Penny.   Barris seems depressed.
Penny is reserved.

         When you called, I wasn't gonna come.

         I'm glad you did, Pen.

                   PENNY
         I said to myself, enough.      Enough of this
         jerk already. Enough.

                    BARRIS
          I could see how you would feel that way.

                    PENNY
          But I've come upon something interesting
          through my delvings into human
          psychology. It's called TA, Transactual
          Analysis.

                       BARRIS
             Transactional Analysis.

                   PENNY
         Now see, by correcting me you're

             (authoritative voice)
         "Here's the proper way to say this word,

         both understand that's what you're doing.
         Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's
         wrong, Chuck? Are you okay?

                       BARRIS
             A guy I knew killed himself last night.

                       PENNY
             My God. Everyone you know kills
             themselves. Or tries. Who is it this
             time?

                       BARRIS
             You don't know him.   A stagehand.

                       PENNY
             Why'd he do it?

                       BARRIS
             He didn't like his work anymore.

                        PENNY
             Is being a stagehand really bad or
             something?

                     BARRIS
              (beat)
          Yeah, it's pretty bad.

Patricia storms up to the table.

                    PATRICIA
          You were supposed to meet me at The Palm
          two hours ago.

                    BARRIS
          Oh fuck, I forgot.

                    PENNY
          Who is this?

                    PATRICIA
          I do not get stood up.   Do you
          understand?

                    BARRIS
          Um, Penny, this is Patricia.
              (to Patricia)
          How did you find me?

                    PATRICIA
          Are you serious? That's what I do for a
          living.

                    PENNY
          Who's Patricia? What does she mean,
          that's what she does for a living?

                    PATRICIA
          You're dead in my book, Strawberry-dick.

                    PENNY
          Strawberry dick?   What's that?

                    PATRICIA
          There is no second chance. Get it?
              (to Penny)
          Nice meeting you, Penny. I've heard a
          lot about you.
              (to Barris, walking away)
          Oh, by the by, Byrd's dead.

Patricia exits.   Penny just looks down at the table.

                    PENNY
          And... and okay... I'm only gonna give
          you one more chance, man. That's it.
          Get it?

                                                            98.



INT. BARRIS'S ROLLS ROYCE - NIGHT

Barris snorts some coke, pulls out of the studio parking lot.
The sound of his heart beating pounds in his ears. Another
car pulls behind him. A wired Barris notices the car in his
rearview mirror. He turns. The other car turns also.
Barris speeds up. So does the other car. Barris panics; he
tries to lose the other car. A chase ensues. Finally Barris
screeches to a halt, pulls a gun from his glove compartment.
The second car screeches to a halt behind him. Barris
already out of his car and at the driver's side window of the
second car. He looks in and sees there are two petrified
teenagers, a boy and a girl, holding up their hands. Barris
pulls open the door.

                    BARRIS
              (screaming)
          Who sent you?! Who the fuck sent you?!

                    TEENAGE BOY
          Nobody, man. We just waited for you to
          leave after the show. We just think the
          show is cool. We just think you're cool.

The girl is crying.

                    TEENAGE GIRL
          Please don't kill us.

Barris points the gun at them for a long while, his hands
shaking wildly.

INT. GONG SHOW WINGS - DAY

Barris stands backstage waiting for his cue. The Unknown
Comic appears next to him, wearing a paper bag with two
eyeholes cut out over his head. Barris glances over at him.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
          Hey, Chuck.

Barris doesn't say anything. He studies the bag. Barris
pulls a pistol from an ankle holster, and jams it against the
bag.

                    BARRIS
          Take it off.

                      UNKNOWN COMIC
          Huh?

                    BARRIS
          The fucking bag. Take it off.

The Unknown Comic takes the bag off.   He looks terrified.
Barris stares him down.

                    ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Chuck Barris!

Barris dances onto the stage.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - CONTINUOUS

Barris is clapping his hands together.   He looks happy and
relaxed. The audience is cheering.

                    BARRIS
          Here he is, the Prince of Puns, the
          Wizard of Whoopee... The Unknown Comic!

The Unknown Comic appears upstage with bag on head.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
          Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie
          Baby...

                     BARRIS
          What?   What do you want?

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
          What's the difference between toilet
          paper and a shower curtain?

                    BARRIS
          I don't know.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
              (calling off)
          Here's the guy!

The audience laughs. Barris feigns annoyance and pushes the
unknown comic off the stage.

                    BARRIS
          Get out of here.

                    UNKNOWN COMIC
              (for Barris's ears only)
          You're fucking crazy, man.

Barris picks up the phone.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Hello?

                    TUVIA (O.S.)
          Hello, is this Chuck Barris?

                    BARRIS
          Yes.

                    TUVIA (O.S.)
          Oh, this is Tuvia Feldman.    I don't know
          if you remember me --

                    BARRIS
          Of course I do.

                    TUVIA (O.S.)
          I'm in town and I've been following your
          career and I wondered if you might want
          to get a drink. For old times sake.

INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

Tuvia plays with the dog.    White panties are revealed.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris waits in a booth, anxiously eyeing the door.      A guy
approaches.

          Hey, Chuck, I got a talent.

          Not now.

                    GUY
          Just take a second.

The guy gets down on all fours and starts barking and panting
like a dog. It is a repulsive and frightening sight, but
Barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off
the guy.

                       TUVIA (O.C.)
          Chuck?

Barris tears his eyes away from the dog guy to look at Tuvia.
She is an older middle-aged lady. Younger than Chuck, but
clearly of no interest to him. The disappointment on his
face is palpable.

                    TUVIA (CONT'D)
          It's Tuvia! Remember? Hi!

                       BARRIS (V.O.)

INT. BAR - LATER

Barris sits in a booth across from Tuvia. The relationship
has shifted once again. Now middle-aged Tuvia is trying to
flirt. As they talk, she touches his arm repeatedly. She
laughs at everything he says. She reapplies lipstick as they
talk. There's a quiet desperation in her eyes. Barris is
pleasant but unengaged.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
             Ah, Tuvia. The fantasy of Tuvia forever
             cast out by the reality of Tuvia.
             Finally, because of my fame and her
             desperate straits, her poverty and single
             parenthood, she was going to submit to
             me. Finally I could've had her.

INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Barris is having sex with two twenty year old nymphettes     The
drugs and alcohol flow freely. He seems to be enjoying
himself but there is a hollowness in his eyes.

                       BARRIS (V.O.)
             Tuvia was old, but not me.   I was the
             Game Show King.

INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

headlined: "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western

stillness.

             What?

                       TELEPHONE VOICE

The contestants appear on stage.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          The winner is Miss Tiny Brooks!

A model appears with a trophy and a big check and hands it to
an enormously fat woman. The other contestants appluad. two
midgets dance. The band plays. A massive amount of confetti
and balloons fall on everyone.

INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

It's the Emmy Awards. Barris is in the audience, next to his
starlet date. He sweats through his tuxedo, fidgets. Ed
Asner and Caroll O'Connor are on stage presenting.

                    ED ASNER
          And the winner is Taxi!

The Taxi theme starts as the winners make their way to the
stage.

             James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, and Ed.
             Weinberger, executive producers.

The starlet whispers into Barris's ear, outraged at the
unfairness.

                        STARLET
             I don't see why your shows are never
             nominated.

Barris looks sick.    Jim Brooks is on stage accepting.

                    JAMES L.BROOKS
          And I honor you, members of the academy,
          for recognizing and supporting high
          quality television.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Barris is locked in a stall, vomiting. The door to the
bathroom opens. Someone enters. Barris peeks through the
closed stall door. It's Jim Brooks, whistling and holding
his Emmy. He places it next to the sink, unzips his fly and
pisses. An agitated Barris pulls his gun from his ankle
holster, opens the stall door a crack, and shakily aims the
gun at Brooks' back.

                                                          104.



EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          But as I stood there, I realized, I
          couldn't kill Jim Brooks, the man who was
          responsible for such good stuff: Mary
          Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis,
          episodes of My Friend Tony. I loved
          those shows as much as anybody in
          America.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Barris is crying. He turns the gun away from Brooks, almost
against his will, and sticks it in his own mouth. After a
moment, he realizes he can't do that either.

                    ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)
          I couldn't kill either of us, so I let us
          both live. Jim Brooks and me. The rest
          is history.

Barris puts the gun away, flushes the toilet and exits the
stall.

                    BARRIS
          Hey, congratulations, Jim.

Brooks turns and looks at Barris.     He smiles.

                     JAMES L.BROOKS
          Oh, hey!   Thanks...

                    BARRIS
          Chuck Barris. The Gong Show.

                       JAMES L.BROOKS
          Oh, right.     Hey, thanks, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Once again you deserve it. Your shows
          are the greatest. You bring so much...
          quality to the medium.
                       JAMES L.BROOKS
          Thank you.     I appreciate that.    I really
          do

They smile and nod at each other awkwardly. Chuck waits for
some sort of return of the compliment. It does not come.
They continue to nod at each other.

                                                            105.



INT. OFFICES OF GRACIE FILMS - DAY

                    ACTUAL JIM BROOKS
          I don't really remember ever meeting
          Chuck Barris.

                    INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
          In the men's room at the Emmys, he says.

Brooks thinks, looks at interviewer.

                    ACTUAL JIM BROOKS
          I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm
          just, y'know... If he remembers it, I'm
          sure it happened. Really doesn't seem
          like much of an anecdote though.

INT. CHATEAU MARMONT BUNGALOW - NIGHT

A big party is in progress. The place is packed. Late
seventies celebrities abound. Alan Alda is there. Burt
Reynolds, Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Gene Gene the Dancing
Machine, Pam Dawber, Farrah Fawcett Majors and Lee Majors,
John Belushi. Chuck Barris steps out of the bathroom, drink
in hand. He wipes his nose like someone who's just snorted
coke. He wanders disconsolately and slightly wild-eyed
through the crowd. He sits in a chair. A man sitting across
from him looks at Barris. His eyes light up.

                    PARTY MAN #1
          Hey, you're Chuck Barris!

                    BARRIS

Party Man #1 begins farting "Jingle Bells."   Barris   gets up
and moves away.

Barris settles by the fireplace.      A pretty woman approaches,

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             How dare you subject the rest of the
             world to your loathsome view of humanity.

                       BARRIS
             I don't think it's that loathsome.

                       PRETTY WOMAN
             What is it then? To mock some poor,
             lonely people who just crave a little
             attention in their lives. To destroy
             them. So everybody's not brilliantly
             talented. They're still people. They
             deserve respect and compassion. I mean,
             who the hell are you? What the fuck have
             you ever done that elevates you above the
             pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you
             created The Dating Game. Wow, right up
             there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess
             that's what gives you the right to...

                    BARRIS
          Excuse me, I've got to --

Barris loses himself in the crowd.    He hurries past a guy who
recognizes and starts chanting.

                    PARTY MAN #2
          Chuckie Baby! Chuckie Baby!     Chuckie
          Baby!

Barris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

Barris makes his way down the crowded street. People stare,
turn their heads to gawk. We hear over and over again: "Hey,
isn't that Chuck Barris?" and "Hey, look, The Gong Show
guy!", and "Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby!" Barris smiles wanly
and nods. People shove paper and pen in his face and he
scribbles autographs without stopping. Sweat forms on his
brow. His polyester shirt is drenched.

                    BARRIS (V.O.)
          She was right. What the hell had I done
          with my life?

Among the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor
he killed in London. He sports a bullet hole in his head
Barris does a double take.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Wait, you're that guy. You're dead.
          This is screwy.

                    FAT BACHELOR
          I only want to be loved.

                    BARRIS
          That's all I fucking wanted!

Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot
others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed,
bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show
contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in
trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead
skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run.
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the
L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost
getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his
breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle-
aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          Mr. Barris?

                       BARRIS
          No, I'm...

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          My name is Louise Wechsler and I'm here
          from Tulsa with my family and...

                    BARRIS
          Please, I'm not feeling well.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          Just a moment of your time. I love your
          show. And, well, I, sort of, have a
          talent myself.

                    BARRIS
          You can stop by the office to audition
          tomorrow.

The woman continues to approach.

                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
          Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just
          wondering. See, I dance a little and I
          was just wondering --

There's no way out of this.     Barris sighs.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah, all right. Go ahead.

Barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She
starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly.
Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
          Very nice.

Something in her hand glints in the light. Barris
reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two
wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams
the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers
back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her.
The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She
straddles him and is about to stab him through the air.
Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The
middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male
voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the
ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into
his brain. The assailant slumps over.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

Barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and
pulls off the wig. He gets up, shaking and heaving. He
looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with
all his might.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

                    ACTUAL BARRIS
          That was it. I just disappeared. The
          network had to put The Gong Show into
          reruns. It was 1981. I holed myself up
          in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, SPRING 1982

We see Barris from above, shivering and naked in the corner.
The manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter.
Barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms,
appealing to the gods.

                       BARRIS
          Who Am I?

There is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor.

                       NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
          Who cares?     Shut the fuck up!

There's a knock at the door.    Barris crawls toward it, peeks
through the peephole.

                     BARRIS
          Fuck.   Shit. Piss.

Barris unlocks the door.    Simon Oliver stands there.

                       OLIVER
          Barris.

                    BARRIS
          How'd you know where I was?

                    OLIVER
          Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don't be an
          orangutan. We always know where you are.
          We always know what you're doing. By the
          by, I'd think twice before I'd attempt to
          get that tripe you're writing published.
          And there's a typo on page --

                    BARRIS
          Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don't
          work for you anymore. I have things
          to...

Barris trails off.

                    OLIVER
          I'd like you to come back for one last
          assignment, Chuck.

                       BARRIS
          No.     Now get... Good-bye

                    OLIVER
          I think you might be interested when I
          tell you it's the mole who fingered your
          friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard... and
          Seigfried Keeler.

                    BARRIS
          Keeler committed suicide.

                    OLIVER
          Yes, of course he did. He threw himself
          from a twentieth floor window after he
          strangled himself to death with an
          electrical cord.

                     BARRIS
              (beat)
          I'm not interested, Oliver.

                       OLIVER
             As long as the mole's alive, you don't
             have a chance in hell of remaining so.
             Besides, killing is in your blood, old
             man. You fit the profile.

Barris lunges at Oliver, pushes him against the wall.

                       BARRIS
             That fucking profile again! What's the
             fuck is it?! What the fuck do you
             bastards know about me, that I don't?!

                        OLIVER
             Indeed.   Where to begin.   First, let go
             of me.

Barris lets go.    Oliver sits in a chair, straightens his
shirt.

                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
          Let's see. Well, you had a twin sister,
          stillborn, strangled by your umbilical
          cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your
          mother always wanted a daughter. She
          blamed you for your sister's death. And,
          so, until your sister Phoebe was born,
          she raised you as a girl.

                    BARRIS
          That's not true.

                    OLIVER
          Oh, and your father the dentist? Not
          really your father. Your biological
          father was a man named Edmund James
          Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your
          mother didn't know when she had an affair
          with him in 1930. If you want to look
          him up, he was also known as the
          Tarrytown Troll, because he had been
          described by witnesses as short and ugly.
          Windsor died in the electrical chair at
          Ossining in 1939. We believed your self-
          loathing tendencies coupled with that
          extra Y chromosome and whatever else you
          inherited from your father would serve us
          well.

                    BARRIS
          You're lying.

                    OLIVER
          I'm trying to think what more I can tell
          you. I'm sure there's more. But you have
          me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I
          don't have your files in front of me.

                    BARRIS
          Just leave me the hell alone!

                    OLIVER
          Your mother always loved the game shows,
          and you so wanted to please her. We
          never expected the game show business to
          work out for you. But that it did,
          turned out to be in our favor. I guess
          your need to be a good daughter drove you
          more than we anticipated.

Barris lunges at Oliver. The two wrestle on the floor.
Barris punches him repeatedly in the face.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Barris lies sleeping in a tangle of sheets. There's blood on
his hands. A knock at the door. Barris jumps awake, grabs
his gun. He looks around. The room is a mess, stuff knocked
over. There's been a fight. He sees his bloody hands.
Another knock.

                       BARRIS
          Huh?     What?

                      PENNY (O.S.)
          Chuck?    It's Pen.

Barris brings his gun with him to the door, looks through the
peephole, then opens the door. Penny stands there, takes in
the room, the mess, the haggard Barris.

                       PENNY (CONT'D)
          Oh, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Jesus, how'd you find me? Am I listed in
          some guidebook or something?

                    PENNY
          You sent me your last letter on hotel
          stationary.

                    BARRIS
          Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen.
          You look beautiful.

Barris hugs her.

                    PENNY
          I don't really. But I appreciate the
          lie. I know how you hate lying.
              (looking around)
          Boy, this place is scary looking.

                    BARRIS
          Yeah.

                    PENNY
          I came to take you back to California
          with me. It's a lonely state without
          you.

                    BARRIS
          I don't know, Redhead.

                    PENNY
          I can't wait forever for you to ask me to
          marry you, you know. Well, apparently I
          can. But I really don't want to. Chuck.

                       BARRIS
          Pen.

                    PENNY
              (crying)
          I love you so much. You don't
          understand. I don't even know why.
          You're such a schmuck.

                    BARRIS
          You don't know the half of it.

                    PENNY
          You're not gonna marry me, are you?

                    BARRIS
          I don't know if I can.

Penny nods her head and leaves.    Barris watches her go, then
falls to the floor and weeps.

Barris, dressed in a suit, sits with Patricia Watson.     He
smiles across the table at her.

             I can't believe you finally left your two-
             hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me.
             I'm honored.

                       BARRIS
             Y'know, I got a visit this morning from
             Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever.
             But she doesn't know who I am, what I've,
             what I'm capable of.

             And she can't ever know. So what does
             she really love? A lie. And I started
             thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman
             in the world who truly knows me. I know
             I've screwed you over in the past, and
             I'm really sorry. I just want you to
             know that you're the one I want to be
             with. I love you, Treesh.

Patricia looks at him. Her hard-as-nails demeanor softens.
She smiles. Barris smiles and reaches across the table for
her hand.

EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

Barris and Patricia stand looking out at the harbor.

                       BARRIS
             I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.

                        PATRICIA
             Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself
             still respects oneself as one who
             despises."

                       BARRIS
             I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't
             even despise myself with any insight.

                       PATRICIA
             Insane asylums are filled with people who
             think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few
             have delusions of being the guy down the
             block who works at an insurance company.
             Wonder what that means.

                        BARRIS
             Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I
             wanted to write something that someday
             some lesser person would quote. But I
             never did. I'm the lesser person,
             Treesh. I never said anything meaningful
             that wasn't said by somebody else first.
             I am disposable. I disposed of people
             and I am disposable.
                 (beat)
             You look cold.

Barris drapes his jacket over Patricia's shoulders.

                       PATRICIA
             Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're
             actually acting like a gentleman.

             Well, it's late. I should get going.

                       BARRIS
             I suppose you still won't tell me where
             you're staying.

                        PATRICIA
             No.   But I'll show you.

She takes his hand.      They walk off.

INT. PATRICIA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Patricia enters followed by Barris.       She turns on the light.

                         PATRICIA
             Drink?

                         BARRIS
             Sure.    Bourbon.

Patricia pours some drinks. There are a couple of chairs
near the window. Barris sits in one.

                       PATRICIA
             I've been thinking a lot about you
             lately, Chuck.

                         BARRIS
             Yeah?

Patricia approaches Barris with the drinks, hands him one.

                       PATRICIA
             I've missed you.

                       BARRIS
             You could've fooled me.

                       PATRICIA
             Well, I've mellowed.

Patricia takes Barris by the hand, leads him to the window.

                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
             Look. Boston's a beautiful city. We
             could start over here. A normal person's
             life. Together. Selling insurance.



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                116.

                    BARRIS
          That sounds right.

Patricia flops down in the chair that Barris had been sitting
in. Barris sits in the chair across from her. Patricia
raises her glass.

                        PATRICIA
          To life.

                        BARRIS
          To life.

Patricia casually slides her hand under the chair cushion.
In one swift move, Barris pulls a gun from his ankle and
shoots Patricia three times, twice in the head, once in the
heart. The force of the bullets has tipped the chair over.
Patricia lies sprawled on the floor.

                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
              (bitterly)
          L'Chaim.

Barris stands and looks at Patricia's body.      She holds a gun.

INT. QUIET CAFE - MORNING

Simon Oliver sits sipping an espresso. He has a black eye
and bruised face. Barris enters, looking haggard. He sits
and stares at Oliver.

                       BARRIS
             It's done and I'm done.   Agreed?

                        OLIVER
             Agreed.   But if you get antsy... and you
             will.

Oliver smiles and walks off. Barris sits for a moment, then
stands, walks over to a payphone and dials.

                       BARRIS
             Hey, Redhead?

INT. CHAPEL - DAY

Barris and Penny are getting married surrounded by friends in
a small chapel.

                       JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
             We have come here today to join together
             Penny Pacino and Chuck Barris.

Barris looks at Penny. Should he slug this guy?    She gives
him a "be patient" look.

          Eight Beauty Show, and The Gong Show.
          The Chuck Barris, who I'm sure will be
          back with even more shows to...

EXT. CHAPEL - DAY

Well-wishers, family, fans, photographers, reporters, and
passers-by are lined up on either side of a red carpet that
leads from the chapel to a limousine waiting at the curb.
Barris and Penny emerge from the chapel. Everyone cheers,
photos are snapped, rice and confetti are thrown, as the
happy newlyweds make their way to the limo, Barris spots a
pinky-ringed hand in the crowd holding a gun. Barris pushes
Penny toward the white limo. The driver stands there holding
the door open. Barris shoves Penny in, then screams at the
driver.

                       BARRIS
             Drive, Danny! Now!

Barris jumps in the car, the driver slams the door closed,
hurries around the driver's door and gets in. The car peals
away from the cab.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

An ashen Barris looks back at the crowd.    Penny watches him.

                       PENNY
             What's going on?

                       BARRIS
                 (still looking out window)
             Pen, I have something to confess.

Penny's expression shifts, turns slightly stony.   She's
getting ready for something bad.

                       PENNY
             Okay.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                       PENNY
             You said that already.

                        BARRIS
             Okay.
                 (beat)
             Okay, but what you don't know is that
             I've brutally murdered thirty-three
             people for the CIA.

Penny just stares blankly at Barris, who can't look at her.
Suddenly she starts to laugh. Danny joins in. Eventually so
does Barris.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris is being interviewed.

                       ACTUAL BARRIS
             Y'know, I came up with a new game show
             idea recently. It's called The Old Game.
             You got three old guys with loaded guns
             on stage They look back at their lives,
             see who they were, what they
             accomplished, how close they came to
             realizing their dreams. The winner is
             the one who doesn't blow his brains out.
             He gets a refrigerator.

The camera holds on Barris's face as he puffs a cigar.

                                                         BLACK.

           So I'm dead...
FADE IN:
EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of
steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark
place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.
We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable
suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the
surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run
for Congress some day.  At first glance.
Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution
style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling
in a strawberry field.
                       JAKE (V.O.)
           And I think it's because of this
           redhead...
                       BUTCH (O.S.)
           Know who I am, Jake?
                       JAKE
           The Anti-Christ?
                       BUTCH (O.S.)
           No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the
           Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy
           looking for some answers.
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being
cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's
ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.
The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his
suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a
"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".
                       BUTCH (cont' d)
           Things are probably going to end badly
           for you, Jake.
                       JAKE
           Gee... What makes you say that?
                       BUTCH
           Your life flashing before your eyes?
                       JAKE
           Just the last three weeks.

EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT
Title: Three Weeks Ago...
The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as
LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles
out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares
off the sweat on his forehead.
A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying
a large black revolver.
                         JAKE
             I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.    I don't
             know what happened.
                         LIONEL
             Y-y-you fucking shot him!   That's what
             happened!
                        JAKE
             I had to! That motherfucker was about
             to welch! You saw what he was doing,
             right? You heard him!
Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.
                         LIONEL
             I can't be here! You understand?     I
             can' t--
                         JAKE
             Listen to me! It went to shit.     It
             happens sometimes.
In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.
                         LIONEL
             Oh Jesus!
                         JAKE
             LISTEN to me! We don't have much time.
             We can still get through this but you
             have to keep your head and trust me!
Jake takes a tentative step forward.     Lionel sees a BLOOD
STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils.
The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.

                            JAKE
             Help me.
Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of.
                                                           CUT TO:
INT. - THE EUCLID BAR
A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar.
A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with
face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel
Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway.
MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the
edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled
with neat stacks of blood splattered money.
A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood.
Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in
disbelief.
                           JAKE
             Come on.    Grab his arms.
Lionel stands frozen.       Jake, drops the dead guy's legs
with a THUD.
                         JAKE
             Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you
             didn't pull the trigger, but you were
             standing right there and watched me do
             it. Help me. Grab his arms.
The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER.
                            MILES
             Tick-tock...
                         JAKE
             If you wanna help, then help.    If not,
             shut up.
                            MILES
             Your mess.
                         JAKE
             Then shut up.
                            MILES
             My place.

CONTINUED:
Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set
Jake off again.
Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles.
                            MILES
             Oh please...
Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under
the bar.
                         MILES (cont' d)
             You think this kinda shit hasn't happened
             here before? Given it's usually on
             Thursdays. And usually, I gotta tell
             the cops, "No, Officer... I didn't really
             get a good look at the shooters."
             Usually anyway.
                         PATRON
                 (without looking up)
             I didn't see nothing. And I swear if
             you let me go now, I won't say-
                         JAKE
             Relax, porkchop.
The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside.
                         LIONEL
             I can't be here!
Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles.
                            JAKE
             Then go.
Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.
                         LIONEL
             What about... The money?
                         JAKE
             What about this situation makes you
             think I can answer that question right
             now?
Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun
leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE
SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought.
                                                         CUT T0:

EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT
Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar
to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt
in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On
the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED
OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder.
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--
                      OFFICER (O.S.)
          Everybody FREEZE!
As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a
full sprint down the street.
                                                         CUT TO:
INT.- THE EUCLID
OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple
of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun
drawn, in a dramatic stance.
                      SOBOZINSKI
              (yelling)
          I said, freeze you motherfucking,
          cocksucking, scumbags!
The second middle aged cop, OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH
comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski.
                         ROTTOVICH
          We're clear.
Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him.
                      SOBOZINSKI
              (still yelling)
          Or I'll blow off every one of your
          fucking heads!
Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH.
We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake, Miles and BIG AL (the Patron)
sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy.
                      JAKE
          Stop waving that thing around.
                      MILES
          You sure we're clear?

             Nice.
                         DEAD GUY
             What took so fucking long?
The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood
soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face.
                         DEAD GUY/GORDO
             I've been lying in this shit like half
             the night.
                         MILES
             You guys were late.   We had to go to a
             Mexican stand-off.
                         JAKE
             And you know I hate guns.
Jake tosses the revolver on the bar.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             We were fighting crime.

             dealers and pedophiles everywhere.
Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo
strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE
VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up
the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody,
explosive squib.
Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing
fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot
where the squib was.
                         GORDO
             Shit.
                         JAKE
             I told you, use less powder.
                         GORDO
             But you won't get that splatter effect.
Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the
pile.

Big Al moves over to the bar.

             Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to
             play the Inside?
                         JAKE

             Shill.

             Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is
             cry and get insulted.
                         JAKE
             What are you talking about? You should
             get a fucking Academy Award for the
             Shill work you do.
                 (off Al's smile)
             We got it down cold, Al. You don't
             want to jinx it by changing something
             up, do you?

             I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want
             eggrolls?
Al slaps Jake on the back and exits.
Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder.
                          JAKE
             What?   I can feel you looking at me.
                         GORDO
             That's a lot of cash. He came up with
             it pretty quick.
                         JAKE
             Probably some investment banker or
             convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did
             you see how fast he ran out of here?
             It's done. He's not coming back.
                         GORDO
             I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did
             anybody mess up the hoop?
                           MILES
             It's clean.
Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway.

             Twenty percent's still better than

Among the hip and well dressed, he seems out of place at
the moment. An outsider.
An attractive blonde in her late twenties, LILY, bumps

             What are you? New? Let me tell you
             how good this guy is. Last night, Al
             calls this bookie to settle up.
             Apparently he's been ducking him for
             like a month. So the guy asks him where
             he's got all this money all of a sudden,
             right? What does Al do?

             Does he tell him that he cashed in a
             fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell
             him he's been giving head out back for
             twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts
             going on about this job he just pulled
             and how he fleeced some Wall Street
             asshole -type... How HE fleeced.

             You're pissed we didn't get credit?
                         GORDO
             No, that was the only semi-fucking smart
             thing he said! Except anybody that's
             ever met Big A1 knows that the only
             thing he's comfortable doing alone is
             eating. This guys tells this guy, that

INT- BIG AL'S APARTMENT- NIGHT
Big Al sits on the Lazy Boy, about to take a big bite of
egg foo young. He stops as the front door is kicked open
with a CRASH.

             Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young.
             The whole thing took about two and a
             half hours. That's how good he is.
                         MILES
             We sure Big Al threw him to us?

All three of them turn their attention out the window.
They watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if
any one of them is looking back.

             A bird flew into my house last night.
Gordo and Miles exchange a look, unsure of how to
respond.

             Just an idea, but let's just fucking
             split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron

             Leave him. Someone's going to find him
             eventually. Then they'll start looking
             for us, too.
A WAITRESS approaches.

INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY
Jake, Miles and Gordo sit at the bar of the run down
watering hole. Jake stands placing neat stacks of money
into a Fed-Ex box.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot
          in a card game. We used it every now
          and then for a rag, but mostly it was
          our office. Our Power Point.
Gordo and Miles start unloading the same neat stacks of
money from their pockets. It's not as much as Jake put
in.
                        JAKE
          That's it?


                      MILES/GORDO
          Bills.../Had that thing...
Shaking his head, Jake seals the Fed--Ex box, then hands
the form to Miles and. Picks up the phone.
                      MILES (cont'd)
          Do we want insurance?
              (off their looks)
          I'm just asking...
                      JAKE
          Just mail it to the hospital.
              (dialing)
          Mr. King, please. It's regarding an
          accounting problem. Yes... Correct...
          I know where it is. That will be fine.
          Thank you.
Jake hangs up the phone.

          Fuck that.    We're going too.
                      GORDO
          Alright, let's all put our dicks back
          in our pants for a second. Is this the
          best thing to do?
Jake levels a stare at Gordo for a second.

A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what
kind of gym it is.
A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and
Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             The King, huh? Nice going.
                         JAKE
             I try.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Don't dick around too long. And if he
             stabs you or shoots you or causes any
             other form of profuse bleeding, call a
             cab because you are not getting back in
             this car!
Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus
stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit.
                         HARLIN
             We appreciate your punctuality.   Mr.
             King is expecting you.
Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up
against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake
down.
                         HARLIN
             Lupus!
                        LUPUS
             What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin'
             him down.
Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way.

             My apologies, Mr. Vig. If you wouldn't
             mind?
Jake steps back and raises his arms.
                          JAKE
             You the one that did it?   You the one
             that got Al?

Harlin gives the Officers Sobozinski and Rottovich a slight
nod of acknowledgment.

A huge room filled with steam. Harlin and Lupus stand by
the door as Jake cautiously steps in. NEW AGE MUSIC is
being played-- Could be Yanni.
Sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth
robe is THE KING PIN. His large body is less fat than
just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the
baldest head you've ever seen.
A MANICURIST sits next to the King Pin working on his
nails.

             You know, back in the day, grafting was
             considered a gentleman's racket. Good
             suits, good food... The Underworld of
             the Underworld. A grifter had to survive
             on his wits, his instincts... I like
             that. I like the idea of that.

Jake turns to find Lupus and Harlin on either side of
him. They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up
for the King.

             I don't like to ask things more than
             once, Junior. I want you to know how
             much that irks me.
The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers
with the nail file.
Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail
file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his
fingers.
Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King
now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress.
                         KING PIN
             You have incredibly soft hands. Good
             cuticles . They' re like a baby's hands.
             Grifters with rough hands... You know
             that they're probably not that good.
             Means they've had to do some hard
             labor to make ends meet. But you...
             Smooth... Supple.
The King continues to stroke Jake's hands with his own
meaty paws.

Lily takes a second to look the guys over. Miles gives
her a wink. Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him.

          gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha

Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin.
Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing.
She puts her hands on Jake's chest and leans in a half
inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. She
whispers...

Again, empty... Jake strides in and approaches the deserted
teller counter.
ANOTHER TELLER MATERIALIZES and greets him with a smile.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             So we cash the check at another bank.
             Jake slides the suitcase and the check
             over to the Teller.

INT.- JFK AIRPORT/TERMINAL HALLWAY- DAY
Like the banks, empty. Jake walks with the suitcase down
the flourescent lit hall towards a series of tables under
a sign marked "Customs."
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             Now, this is the most important part--
             You can't just walk into the United
             States with a suitcase full of cash
             without evoking the words "cavity
             search".
As we get closer to the Custom's Desk, a CUSTOMS OFFICER
wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge
MATERIALIZES behind it.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             That's why you need someone on the inside
             at Customs.
Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him. The
Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope
stuffed with cash under it.

The Officer literally looks the other way as he pockets
the envelope and waves Jake through the gate.

Jake exits the terminal. Outside, the street is empty,
not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage handler or a
cab. Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the "walk"
signal is given.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             Then we disappear.
As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying
luggage... Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP...
Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING
into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in
the crowd.

             This might just be me, but that is hands

             ever heard.
                         GORDO
             People have tried this before, Jake.
             It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and
             his crew went on vacation in Chicago
             for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched
             in L.A.
                         JAKE
             It never worked before because A, they
             didn't flush the bank enough; B, their
             corporate papers were for shit; C,
             they didn't have someone on the inside
             with Customs.
                         MILES
             Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking
             idea...

             What are you talking about? Yes we

             nice kiss my ass card attached to it.

             about Al? I'm pissed too, but I' m not
             like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
                         JAKE
             I'm getting clear of this. If you're

             No, not "whatever." You're either in or

A silence falls over everyone.

An office of empty chairs and desks. Through the windows
we can see the hustle and bustle of the precinct. SPECIAL
AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, still dressed in the same shitty
suit, sits behind a desk as Rottovich and Sobozinski
enter.
                          MOONAN
             Gentlemen?   Special Agent Gunther Moonan.
Moonan quickly flashes a badge and his best Kodak smile.

             some time now. Problem is, the guy's
             the invisible man. A spook, a spectre,
             a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's
             good buddy and member of his crew,
             Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day
             with a hole in his head.

             Sitting there, bloated and purple in
             his egg foo young for at least seventy
             two hours. Alfonse was not a small man
             and there was a lot of food ordered, so
             you can imagine the smell. Bad for the
             neighbors, good for me because in all
             the time I've been looking for Jake,
             this is only the second time I've even
             gotten a whiff of him.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't
             know what you're talking about.
Moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits PLAY.

                 (V.O. from tape)
             Don't be an idiot. How hard do you
             think it is to sell one drug dealer's
             drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's
             right, we might be looking at a
             hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand.
CLICK.   Moonan kills the recorder.

             had a line on Vig? He sent me a
             birthday card.
                 (off their silence)
             Belated, but it's the thought, right?
             Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor.
             But, then again you guys probably know
             him better than I do. In fact, I've

             Stake you?
                         JAKE
             I need you to stake me. I can't do it
             without it. It's just a couple hundred
             grand. Taken out of our cut when we're
             done.
King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second.
                         KING PIN
             That's more than you already owe me.
             What happens if you fuck this up?
                         JAKE

             Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes.
             You just might learn something here.
Lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes.
                         KING PIN
             Listen, Scooter---
                         JAKE
             No, you listen. We're partners now and
             even though I'm running the show for
             you, I'm still running the show. That
             means I get a little respect. So I
             don't want to hear anymore of this
             Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger,

             And I gotta tell you, for a guy who
             spends all his time in a gym, you
             could be in better shape.
A few of the BOXERS training around stop and turn.          The
King Pin lowers a glare at Jake.
                         KING PIN
             Take off your shirt.
Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming.
                          JAKE
             Excuse me?
                         KING PIN
             I said take off your fucking shirt.
A few more BOXERS stop and turn. Jake notices he's being
watched. The King Pin takes a step towards Jake...
                          JAKE
             Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll
             take it off.
Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King
Pin, arms crossed. It's getting weird.
                         KING PIN
             Look at you, you skinny prick.
                         JAKE
             You're not going to bust out baby oil
             and start rubbing me down or anything,
             are you?
The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt.       Harlin
and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance.
The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly
large, incredibly round stomach which he SLAPS loudly.
                          KING PIN
             Come here.   Feel this.
                          JAKE
             No thanks.   I'm good.
                          KING PIN
             Come here!
The King grabs Jake's hand and puts it on his stomach.
It just got weirder.
Now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on Jake
and the King Pin.

             Shut up. Feel that? That's solid
             muscle. Not an ounce of fat. Go ahead.
             Punch it.
                         JAKE
             I am not going--
The King starts to get that look again.
Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach.           He
shakes his fist in pain.
                           KING PIN
             Come on.    Harder.
                         JAKE
             I think I just broke my hand.
                           KING PIN
             Harder.    Remember, I killed your buddy.
Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King
as hard as he can. The King just smiles.
                           KING PIN (cont'd)
             All muscle.
The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising
speed. Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right
there. With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel
him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness.
Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into
the ring.
                         KING PIN
             Maybe it's true. Maybe you can't cheat
             an honest man. Me? I'm about as
             dishonest as they come and that's the
             truth. But if you even think about
             trying to con me they'll find fucking
             pieces of you in each of the five
             boroughs. Pieces of you, pieces of
             her, pieces of your whole crew. Can't
             be any mare honest than that. I'll
             stake you, but that's three hundred
             fifty you're in the hole and consider
             the juice running. Now go make me proud.
Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up.        Lily looks at Jake with a
pained expression.

             personal ad you wear over your head.
Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a
cab goes for the same one. Michelle gets into a screaming
match with the man.
FREEZE FRAME ON MICHELLE--- A CGI SIGN appears over her

They're greeted by FRANKIE SUITS, an ancient rake-thin

             Back in the day, Suits made money
             running fight stores and the wire with
             a Fix so tight it was like a legit
             business. I never understood what the
             point was if grifting became like a
             regular job.

             So what do you want?
                         JAKE
             I want to get out from under all this
             for good. And I want to fuck them all
             doing it.
                         SUITS
             Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you
             can't get what you want.
Jake considers those words for a moment.
                          JAKE
             Yes I can.
Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods.
The he gently rests his hands on the papers.

             Can't do it Suits.      I can't lay down

             Okay. Here's the thing... You fall
             flat, you might not get anything short
             of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land
             for everybody. Papers like these are
             dangerous because papers tend to
             multiply, then they start to take
             shape. Usually it's the shape of an
             arrow. I hate to do it, but after this,
             I gotta give you the blowoff.
             We Jake, Jake?
Suits holds out his hand.         Jake takes it.

             We're Jake.
They shake, knowing it'll be the last time.

INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- CONTINUOUS
We follow Lily and Jake out of Suit's office.           Lily can
see that it's thrown Jake a bit.
                         LILY
             What the hell's his problem?

Jake stops and turns to her, looking her up and down.

             You need to get a haircut.

INT. - TIFFANY'S - NIGHT
Jake and Lily enter the store. Jake takes a quick moment
to case the place-- A few scattered CUSTOMERS, some being
helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like the
uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's.
                         JAKE
                 (to himself)
             Oh yeah. This is good. This will do
             nicely.
                 (to Lily)
             This is about confidence. Your
             confidence and their confidence. You
             get their confidence by giving them
             yours.
Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow
turn around the store.
He casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to
MR. LEWIS, an older, distinguished looking gentleman,
being helped by a SALEGIRL, who is scribbling on an order
form.
                         SALESGIRL
             Let me read this back. One silver
             Cattier watch, engraved-- "To Carolyn,
             the Attorney at Law. Happy Graduation,
             Counselor. Love Mom and Dad."
                         MR. LEWIS
             Right.
                         SALESGIRL
             One bracelet, engraved "To Abby.   Happy
             25th Anniversary, Love Tom."

                         SALESGIRL
             I' ll just go put this in, Mr. Lewis.
The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away.
A change comes over Jake. It's subtle-- Posture, facial
expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there.
                          JAKE
             Mr. Lewis?
Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint
of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old
friend.
                          JAKE
             It is you.   Hello!
Jake extends his hand.
                          MR. LEWIS
             Sorry, I--
                         JAKE
             Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool
             with your daughter. Carolyn. We met
             once or twice.
Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his
hand more in an effort not to appear rude.
                          MR. LEWIS
             Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you.
                         JAKE
             Well, it certainly is a coincidence.
             Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
                          MR. LEWIS
             Great.   Thank you.
The Salesgirl returns.
                         JAKE
             Excuse me? I believe you're holding
             something far me under Pearson.
                         SALESGIRL
             Do you have a ticket?

             I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But
             the   name's Pearson.
                         MR. LEWIS
             While you're back there, could you make
             sure that Carolyn is spelled with a
             "y"?
The Salesgirl nods and disappears again.
                         MR. LEWIS (cont'd)
             What brings you down from Boston, Jake?
             Taking advantage of the long weekend?
                         JAKE
             My wife and I are just taking a little
             vacation.
Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over.
                         MR. LEWTS
             Carolyn's down this weekend too.
Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and
gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for
a second.
                         LILY
             Uh... Everything okay?
                         JAKE
             Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn
             Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my
             wife, Lily.
Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes.
                         JAKE
             I'm sorry, honey.    I'm almost done.
Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around
her waist.
                           LILY
             It's okay.    I'll be looking for
             earrings.
Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves.
                         MR. LEWIS
             Attractive girl.

             anniversary   this weekend. She thinks
             I'm here to   pick up something for my
             mother, but   it's actually a gift for
             her. Think    I've fooled her?
                         MR. LEWIS
             Take it from me, you never do. But
             congratulations. Nice to be married,
             isn't it?

             Very much so.
Jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's
pretending to be. The Salesgirl returns.
                         SALESGIRL
             We have Carolyn with a "y". I'm sorry,
             there's nothing under Pearson. If we
             had an invoice number--
Jake's smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious.
                         JAKE
             I told you. My wallet was stolen.
             Please... Check again.
Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on
earrings with another Salesperson.
                           MR. LEWIS
             Good luck.    Congratulations again.
He and Jake shake hands.
                         JAKE
             Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this
             isn't too much of an inconvenience, but
             if Carolyn is coming down for the
             weekend, perhaps I could give you
             something for her? It's a check. We
             split the cost on a few books and I
             haven't had the chance to pay her back
             yet. Could you..?
                           MR. LEWIS
             Sure.
Jake pulls out a checkbook and pen.
                         JAKE
                 (writing)
             That'd be a great help.

Jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case.

             A ring for my wife. Alot like that
             one. In fact, it was that one.

             Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW' s,
             if you took the time to light three
             cigarettes with one match, some Nazi
             would be able to figure out where you
             were. Then, well... It was the last
             cigarette you and your two buddies ever
             had. So three on a match is bad luck.

             Well, typically, corporate loans are
             relatively simple matters, but you do
             need to demonstrate a capacity for gross
             fund recovery.

          So this is our boss, right? He chases
          me and Miles out of his office and
          he's yelling and screaming, "You're

          But the best part was that he couldn't
          find Gordo! He was in the bathroom.
          So he finally goes in there, kicks in a
          stall door and starts yelling! And

Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm. It's meant to
be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's

             Right. The guys who started that did
             what a lot of companies in the Valley
             do. They get a good idea, shop it
             around, raise some capital, then sell
             it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,
             Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of
             it is, they've pretty much sold the
             company before they're even real. The
             bigger company is already set to buy
             it, all they want to do is make sure
             that the idea actually works. So they
             get some start up capital, make it work,
             then sell it for like five times the
             initial loan.

             Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you
             can't tell anyone about the offer,
             because if it's public, you could start
             a bidding war and that's considered a
             breach of etiquette. It could kill a
             deal. But, wait too long and you're

Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality
of this slum-pit studio apartment.
Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck. A spoon
RATTLES in a glass from the growing RUMBLE of a passing
subway train. The RUMBLE rises to an almost deafening
volume.
Jake's a little alarmed.   Lily, oblivious.

Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some
of last night's magic.
                     JAKE
          Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be
          alright. You're not in the hole with

Lily rolls away from Jake.   Undaunted, Jake starts kissing
her back.

                         LILY
             Sort of. I was telling him about this
             great love of my life who's name I don't
             remember, and I could see... He was
             getting pissed. I thought it was just
             because he was worried about me, but...

             He told me that I was stupid because
             my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Jake grabs Lily and rolls her over onto her back.     He
climbs on top of her.
                         JAKE
             He was looking out for you.
                         LILY
             Then he grabbed me and threw me down
             on the floor, that really cold
             linoleum tiled hospital floor and
             started ripping my uniform off.
                 (pause)
             He said he was going to "fuck some
             sense into me."
Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her.
                         LILY
             Shit, what was that guy's name?   I really
             liked him.
                         JAKE
             Lily... Jesus Christ...
                         LILY
             After Glenn was finished, he gave me a
             couple of valiums and I went home. The
             next day, I finished my shift and met
             him around back, like we always did. I
             stuck a number eight scalpel into his
             chest. Three or four times.
Jake slides off Lily.
                         JAKE
             Did, uh... Did you kill him?
                         LILY
             I don't know. I packed up my shit and
             ran away. To this... So unlike you, I
             guess I do have something to prove, in
             a repressed anger sort of way.
Jake considers for a second.
                         JAKE
             No. You trusted him... You were just
             getting square.
                         LILY
             You know why I told you that, Jake?
                 (turning towards him)
             Because I trust you too.

Butch lowers the gun down and looks over at Lily.

Butch freezes as A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the BACKGROUND,
growing CLOSER then FADING again. He puts the gun back

Ashby leafs through the money in the envelope.

Three or four times over.

There's a pause before Ashby smiles, then reaches around

Jake turns just in time to catch Rottovich's fist square

Jake staggers back and Sobozinski pushes him into an

             going to run into some bad luck. Save
             some. Put it away, so when shit like
             this happens, you're not desperate.

             Hey, we fucked once, honey. That
             hardly makes you a good judge of
             character. And don't think I didn't
             know you were working some angle with

             Just go wherever it is you would go.

Jake stops and levels a look at Lily.

             So there it is. You got that big itch
             you need to scratch. It's all about
             the fucking money. What do you want,
             an apology?

Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake.

             You're an asshole.
With that, she grabs her coat and leaves.

             guy was, but he was so pissed off at
             him, he gets him drilled. It ain't

Lily frantically rumages through drawers. She pulls a

Lily moves to the door and looks out the peep hole.

             HOLD ON!
Another KNOCK. Lily slowly reaches for the doorknob.
Then the door flies open with a CRASH. Harlin fills the
doorway.
                         HARLIN
             The King would like to have a word
             with you.
Lily, wide-eyed, stands frozen with the bat still cocked..

             Uh, right now?
                           HARLI
             Please.    I have a car waiting.
Lily takes a swing.      Harlin easily grabs the bat and
backhands Lily. She      goes flying back into the far wall,
bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where
she finds the butter     knife.
Harlin reaches down and pulls Lily up by the hair.            The
egg SIZZLES in the pan.
Lily takes a stab at Harlin, but the knife just bounces
off his coat. Harlin slaps Lily again, sending her flying
into the stove. Smoke starts to rise from the burning
egg.
Harlin steps closer, but Lily throws her hands up in
surrender.
A spoon RATTLES in a cup as the RUMBLE of a subway train
grows LOUDER.

             No problem.
She grabs the smoking pan from the stove and WHACKS Harlin
across the head. The burned egg lands on the floor.
Lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet, like a
drunk. She raises the pan again... But before she
delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing
his leg to shoot out from under him. He lands flat on
his back, out cold. The wood floor CREAKS with his weight.
Lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot
plate off.

             I gotta tell you, I was pretty
             convinced that the whole thing before
             was blowing her off for her cut. You
             know how it is, get her to do some
             shit for you, throw her a bang to keep
             her happy. But, if you're into her...

             Not for nothing, Jake, but the guy who
             whacked your buddy? It was me. The

             stuff, but I tell ya, he was so pissed
             off he couldn't wait for the regular

             Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to
             Customs and he gets caught. We get our
             money back, but then we have to deal
             with a criminal investigation. I don't
             much like that idea. Then again, let's
             suppose he actually gets through
             Customs. Now, that'll be something.
             We recover the money in cash and let
             the insurance cover the corporate fraud.
             We double our money.

             Like putting on a play... Guess some
             people forgot their lines.
                         JAKE
             Guess so.

             So why don't you take a deep breath,
             Jake, and I'll count to ten. One.
             Two. Three...
As Butch continues to count, Jake slowly turns his head
and looks at Lily.
Butch, still counting, smiles at Lily's obvious contempt
then slides the gun along the back of Jake's head.
                         JAKE
             I do trust you, Lily.
Butch turns back to Lily to see her reaching into her
bag...
                         BUTCH
             Wha-
Butch spins and aims at her.
Lily pulls out a gun and... BLAM!!!

             play her part. Because playing the big

	INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

	The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
	speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
	a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
	FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
	TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
	pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
	distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
	assured.

				HELEN
		Our society creates these socially
		and psychically disenfranchised
		men, and their revenge on society
		is terrible.  They are hard to
		catch.  They are "the nice guy next
		door," their employers -- if they
		work at all -- find them quiet and
		uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
		rejection have taught them
		passivity.  Only in their violent
		fantasies do they feel alive.  What
		they seek in their frenzied
		assaults on their victims is relief
		from passivity.  For these men, ten
		minutes relief is worth far more
		than the life of another human
		being.  Torture, the pain they
		inflict, the screams of the victim,
		are all part of the ritual that
		gives them a brief respite from
		their own psychic pain.  And then
		the depression, the forgetting, the
		feeling of sadness and despair
		begins the cycle all over again.
		Like addicts seeking their drug,
		Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
		Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
		seek out their next victim.

	During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
	has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
	balcony railing.

	CLOSEUP: HELEN

				HELEN
		The cycle is endless until they are
		caught.  And they are caught by
		chance -- they run a red light, and
		a body is in the trunk.  A leaking	
		pipe brings a plumber to a basement
		where they is the smell of death.

	Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
	the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

	HELEN'S POV:

	Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
	MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
	arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

	HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

	Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
	alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
	exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
	wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
	attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

	Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
	there.

	HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

				HELEN
		At any time, right now, as you
		listen, the FBI estimates there are
		30 to 35 serial killers stalking
		their victims.  The serial killer is
		a plaque that must be addressed not
		only by the law, but by science.
		Florida spent eight million dollars
		to execute Ted Bundy.  It would
		have been better spent building a
		forensic penal facility devoted to
		research.

	Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
	that the smiling man is not there...

				HELEN
		Confined for life, without parole,
		and subjected to scientific study,
		these men's lives might finally, in
		some small measure, educate and
		thereby protect society.  Thank
		you.

	Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
	carefully casing the crowd.

								CUT TO:

	LATER:

	The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
	ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
	as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
	THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
	DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

								CUT TO:

	INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

	THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
	around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
	hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
	Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
	stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
	high heels to a stall several doors down.

	CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:

	And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
	ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
	view as

	HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
	around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
	makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
	just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
	DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.

	Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
	yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

	CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
	the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
	reacts...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

	The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
	hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

				COP (o.s.)
		Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
		there?

	The MAN lets slip a little slack.

	HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
	get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
	scream.

	CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
	sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
	a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
	there is more SOUND from inside...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
	we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
	her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
	toilet seat.

	COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
	see a broom closet door opening.

	HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
	second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
	his gun still in his hand.

	RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
	HELEN.

	COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
	in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
	the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

	STAGE AREA

	The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
	HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

								SLAM CUT:

	INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
	desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
	pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
	eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

				HELEN
		Andy!  Andy!

	She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
	FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
	hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

	INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

	The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
	is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

	HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
	HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
	where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
	The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
	herself with the sound of her own voice...

				HELEN
		It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
		city of San Francisco, California,
		U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
		most stable and happiest country in
		the world.  That is the sole place
		of life in the universe.  Under
		God.

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
	others scattering from the nervous haste...

	CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
	tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
	reflection with a certain detachment...

				HELEN
		Good God.  What happened to you?

	She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
	herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

								CUT TO:

	HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
	She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
	Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
	other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
	screen comes a command.

				CHESSMASTER
		'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
		move.'

	She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
	move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
	computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

				CHESSMASTER
		'Lousy move.  Not really into this
		game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
		got a feeling about you.  Let's
		meet.  Like a date.'

	HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

				HELEN
		'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
		life.'

				CHESSMASTER
		'Another romantic dream gone all to
		hell.'

				HELEN
		'Maybe it's better to just dream
		on; avoid the disappointments of
		life.  Come on, move.'

	She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
	curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
	T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
	the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

	VIEW:

	A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
	morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
	HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the
	air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
	horror of the night...

	O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.

	CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
	handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

				HELEN
			(carefully)
		Yes?
			(listens)
		You son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
		a bitch...

	Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

				HELEN
		You filthy... son of a bitch!

	On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
	move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

				COMPUTER
			(filter)
		You Queen is in check.
		Protect your Queen.

	OVER CREDITS:

	HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
	morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
	a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
	near the end of a satisfactory run.

	THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
	SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
	AT WORK HERE.

	NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S
	OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE

	A SCREAM!

	END TITLE AND CREDITS:

	INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

	MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
	DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...

	THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
	centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
	shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
	FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
	in the circle.

	We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
	HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
	young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
	appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
	thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
	sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
	sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
	even smaller and younger than she is.

	RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
	in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
	and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
	belt.

	M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
	AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

				M.J.
		I'd feel a whole lot safer with
		Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look
		at this guy: you shredded him!

				RUBEN
		Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
		now.

	The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
	to shooting position.

				M.J.
		It's sloppy shooting.  It's in
		character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
		And bad for your career.

	RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
	circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

				RUBEN
		I've been practicing.  Now can I
		kiss your tummy?

	M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

				M.J.
		Perp's holding a hostage, the
		shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
		be exposed.

	SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
	fire.

				M.J.
		Answer it.

				RUBEN
		I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
		you at least interested in which
		one it is?

	She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
	answers, she raises her gun and aims...

				RUBEN
			(into phone)
		I'm here, where are you?...
		Heeeeyyy!  What a surprise!  No.  On
		duty, have to call you back... You,
		too, you too.  My God, you made my
		day.

	He hits the "end" button...

				M.J.
		You hit the brachial nerve...

	SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
	inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
	IN THE MIDDLE!

				M.J.
		You're good enough you'll never
		have to kill anyone.  I joined the
		cops to save lives, not waste them.

				RUBEN
		You know, M.J., when I watch you
		shoot, I realize I've got a little
		problem with my stance... could you
		just move over here and critique my
		legs?

	He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
	She is unloading her weapon...

				M.J.
		The problem is between your legs.
		You told your shrink about that?

	She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

				RUBEN
		I tell my shrink about you,
		Sergeant.  I tell him you're the
		top cop of my dreams.

	Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
	he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
	one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

				M.J.
			(putting away her
			 gear)
		Don't take that mess in the car.

	They're on the move; as they go away from us...

				RUBEN
		He's in love with you already...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
	Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
	thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
	is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
	A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
	SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
	M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

				M.J.
		Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
		here.

	She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
	of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

				RUBEN
		Hey.  And there's the Haircut right
		behind.  If she stops short he's
		gonna be there feet up her ass...

				SUSAN
			(on camera)
		Inspector, can you...

				M.J.
		I just got here myself, Susan.

				SUSAN
		...confirm this third murder adds
		up to a pattern?  Do we have a
		serial killer on the loose in the
		city?

				M.J.
		I just got here.  Talk to you
		later...

				M.J.
			(as they escape behind the
			 barrier tape)
		What the hell does she want to do,
		scare everybody to death?

				RUBEN
		That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
		here already.

	QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
	stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
	As they climb up toward him...

				QUINN
		I been waiting... I have to do
		everything myself.  Photo, crime
		tech, the Coroner are already
		inside.  The Landlady calls it in;
		tenant is not answering when
		called, she sticks her head in,
		sees the body, uses the deceased's
		telephone to call 911.  Otherwise
		nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
		kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
		and the Haircut.

	M.J. and Ruben enter...

	INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY

	Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
	at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
	chain-smoking (the Landlady).

				M.J.
			(to cop)
		That the Landlady?
			(to Ruben)
		You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
			(back to cops)
		Who was first on the scene?

	Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

				MIKE
		I was.

				M.J.
			(forcefully)
		I'm over here?  What's your name,
		Officer?

				MIKE
		Michael Johnson.

				M.J.
		You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
		anything?  Use the doorknob?  I
		don't want to find your prints on
		anything later and you tell me you
		forgot to tell me.

				MIKE
		No.  I didn't.

	She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
	DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
	still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
	pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
	leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
	slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

	Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
	MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.

	M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
	Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
	finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
	men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
	them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
	body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
	THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
	
	ON M.J.:
	
				DOC (V.O.)
		Liver and rigor are telling me
		about eight hours.  I'm gonna take
		her out now if it's alright.

				M.J.
		I'm seeing ligature marks on her
		neck here, petechial hemorrhages in
		her eyes.  Strangled.

				DOC
		You got it.  Same as the other two.

	THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

				COP (V.O.)
		Tell whoever she can't come to the
		phone, she's all tied up.

	Nobody laughs...

				M.J.
		That's real old material, get a new
		writer...

	She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
	it in tissue someone hands her...

				M.J.
		Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
			(extremely cheerful)
		Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
		are you this morning?

				M.J.
		What is this about, Ms Martinez?

				PHONE VOICE
		I'm conducting a telephone survey
		to determine whether you're
		satisfied with your insurance on
		your personal valuables...

	M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
	Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

				DOC
		He used something soft, like a
		stocking or a bathrobe tie.

				M.J.
		Anybody find it?

	No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
	lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
	into the dead woman's eyes...

				M.J.
		Cover her up, please.

	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
	approaches Mike... takes him aside...

				M.J.
		Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's
		bothering you?

	Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

				M.J.
		Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
		and sooner is a hell of lot better
		than later.

				MIKE
		Well, there's something missing in
		there.  There was something around
		her neck when I came in there, but
		it's gone now.

				M.J.
		Who came in after you?

				MIKE
		Lieutenant  Quinn.

	She seems relieved.  Brightly:

				M.J.
		Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
		Thanks.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the
	scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming
	out...

				M.J.
			(to Photographer)
		Get me good faces on the crowd
		here.  Get a couple of harness bulls
		to grab anybody who starts to
		run...

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Don't tell your Grandmother how to
		suck eggs.  I only been doing this
		work since your junior prom,
		darling...

	But M.J. is already on to other things.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	CLOSE ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER THAT LIES ON THE FLOOR FIVE OR
	FIX FEET FROM THE DOOR TO HELEN'S APARTMENT.  HOLD DOOR IN
	B.G.

	The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and
	Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look
	of despair.

	HELEN'S POV

	The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

	HELEN

	As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach
	it.

	POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia
	manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL
	STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;
	SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

	HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
	into the hall...

	POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.
	The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

	HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward
	the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and
	squirms back inside.

	INT. APARTMENT - DAY

	As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for
	breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the
	newspaper... INSERT:

	POLICE BAFFLED IN DEATHS OF THE WOMEN

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Damn fools!

							CUT TO:

	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.
	Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

				SUSAN
		... continues to stonewall the
		public.  Now...

	There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

				M.J.
		You messed with the scene.

				QUINN
		Shut up.

	He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

				SUSAN
		... third Bay Area woman has been
		strangled, but the police continue
		to deny that this is the work of
		one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn
		declares that the murders will be
		treated as unrelated crimes, unless
		new evidence...

	M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...

				M.J.
		You messed with the evidence.

				QUINN
		I tagged the goddamned stocking.
		It ain't lost.  We're sequestering
		that evidence.  That's the trap some
		son of a bitch is going to fall
		into...

				M.J.
		Am I in charge of this thing?  Or
		not.

				QUINN
		I said you were...

				NH
		Then I decided what evidence we
		choose to sequester.

				QUINN
			(a beat here)
		Okay.  What do you want to
		sequester?

				M.J.
		The stocking around the neck.

	A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

				QUINN
		You didn't say serial killer and I
		didn't say serial killer.

				M.J.
		Right.

				QUINN
			(not satisfied she
			 really means it)
		This is the anniversary of the
		summer of love and your city
		fathers have declared a Festival of
		Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of
		Commerce don't want TV announcing
		killers on the loose.

				M.J.
		Right.

	And she starts to go...

				QUINN
		We're gonna have a bunch of clapped
		out old hippies blissing on the
		Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the
		park, smoking dope and sticking
		tulips up their ass.

				M.J.
			(exiting)
		Good.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known
	sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add
	to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these
	people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall
	intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false
	confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

				NIKKO
		Harvey, I don't want you in here no
		more, making false statements...

				CONFESSOR
		They are not false.  We pay for
		city government like this, you
		don't even care about the truth?!
		I killed her in the bathtub.

				NIKKO
		Why?

				CONFESSOR
		Because she was dirty, a dirty
		girl!

				NIKKO
		How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

				HARVEY
		With a knife?

				NIKKO
		Good guess, but not good enough.
		Get the fuck outta here...

	He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He
	falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
	is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
	hygiene checkup...

				NIKKO
		What am I wasting my time with this
		shit for?

				M.J.
		Because it's your job, that's all.

				NIKKO
		Not what I meant; why me?

				M.J.
			(cutting)
		Maybe it's something you did in
		this life, Nikko...

	It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
	argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

				NIKKO
		Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

	Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

				M.J.
			(to Ruben)
		Get Mercer to run the medical,
		dental, legal bills, laundry and
		dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
		ators, mailmen, grocery and
		drugstore deliveries, handymen,
		plumbers...

				RUBEN
		It's mostly done, they got nobody
		in common, the three of them... No
		mutual friends -- the Landlady says
		nobody was ever there, she never
		saw her with anybody.

	They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on
	phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

				PACHULSKI
			(into phone)
		Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk
		her right now... because she's 
		busy, she's all tied up.
			(sotto to M.J.)
		Deep Throat's back.

	He hits the speaker phone...

				FEMALE PHONE VOICE
		This is the third one.  You've got
		a serial killer here.  When are you
		going to start warning people?

				PACHULSKI
			(whispering)
		Fourteen calls from this broad.
		And she ain't stupid.

	M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,
	switches off the speaker...

				M.J.
		Who is this?

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

	HELEN on phone

				HELEN
		Who is this?

				M.J.
		Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm
		in charge here.

				PACHULSKI
			(amused)
		Ask her about the moon bike.

				M.J.
		I'm really interested in your
		ideas.  The moon bike.  What is
		that?

				HELEN
		What is wrong with you people?
		The first two, I thought he might
		be on a lunar cycle because they
		were 28 days apart, but obviously
		not.  This new one is only two
		weeks.

	Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
	not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

				HELEN (cont'd)
		You want to joke about moonbikes?!

				M.J.
		No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And
		neither is tying up telephone lines
		to police with crank calls while
		people in trouble are trying to get
		through for help.

				HELEN
		You're calling me a crank?

				M.J.
		Do you have any evidence to report,
		ma'am?  Do you know any of the
		victims...

				HELEN
		I think this is number three...

				M.J.
			(over her)
		That's an opinion, not evidence...

	Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
	at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on
	the slip of paper...

				M.J.
			(covers the phone)
		Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back
		here?

	As she turns back to the phone...

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
	she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
	looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a
	key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her
	assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and
	mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
	face...

				HELEN
		Where were you?  Don't tell me.
		It's just under seventy, right?  The
		sun is strong but the air is dry
		and fresh...

				ANDY
		Would you please get your hands off
		my face, Tallulah?  What happened
		to the newspaper?

	He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
	When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

				HELEN
		I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

				ANDY
		Well!  Aren't we the daring one?
		What's morbid and ghastly enough in
		the news to make Doctor Helen set
		foot outside her door?  The antenna
		is gone off her car again.  I had
		no music, all the way to the
		market.  Let me find a garage for
		it?

	They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
	expensive goodies...

				HELEN
		I've told you:  I can't afford to
		garage it.

				ANDY
		Are you kidding?  You buy enough
		gourmet junk every week... most of
		which rots... to garage a fleet of
		stretch limos.

				HELEN
		I had the dream again.
			(beat)
		And I got another call.  This time
		he spoke.  He said "You and me, you
		and me."

				ANDY
		A little heavy breathing is what
		most of us yearn for.  Forget it.

				HELEN
		He whispered, but it was him!  I
		know it was him!

	Andy now stops to address this seriously...

				ANDY
		He can't phone you unless the
		warden gets an okay from you.  Did
		you give him an approval?

				HELEN
		Andy?  When a three-year-old says
		there's a monster under the bed,
		you don't say 'forget it'.  You
		look under the bad.
			(beat)
		I'm three years old.  Call the
		prison.

	Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
	breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

				HELEN
		Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

				ANDY
		When was the last time you washed
		your hair?

				HELEN
			(shaky, but trying)
		Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
		coiffure?

				ANDY
		Monsieur Andy can smell your
		coiffure.  And guess what else?

	He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

				ANDY
		Cellulite.  What do you say I
		blindfold you and take you to the
		gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

	HELEN AT WINDOW

				HELEN
		Andy?

	Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

				ANDY
		Here we go again.

	ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET

	In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
	face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

				HELEN
		You parked right behind him.  The
		one I noticed earlier.  I didn't
		say anything, I thought he'd leave.
		Just take a look.

				ANDY
		Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A
		NEWSPAPER!

				HELEN
		But earlier, he was staring up
		here.  Please, Andy.

				ANDY
		Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'
		coming up.

	ANDY leaves the apartment.

	EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

	The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
	peers out, sees:

	ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
	up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
	THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.

				ANDY
		Excuse me, but would you mind
		explaining why you're watching the
		lady upstairs?

				RUBEN
		None of your fucking business.

	Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
	close to RUBEN'S window.

				ANDY
		Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

	RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
	car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
	ANDY'S nose.

				RUBEN
		I hate this...

				ANDY
		Only kidding!

	RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
	head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
	door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
	position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,
	RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

	M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES
	FAST AND GETS OUT.

	HELEN at window, shouting.

				HELEN
		I'm calling the police!

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her
	badge to Helen.

				M.J.
		Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I
		apologize for Goetz, he's a
		firehouse dog.

				ANDY
			(trying to defuse)
		I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed
		it.

	Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
	what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is
	confused, fighting back fear...

				M.J.
			(trying to communicate
			 here)
		Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor
		impulse control.

				HELEN
		Is he out?

				M.J.
		Who?

				HELEN
			(to Andy)
		If he's not out, why are they here?

				M.J.
		Because of your phone calls.

				HELEN
		What calls?  I haven't made any
		calls.

				ANDY
			(to distract)
		Are you staying long?  Shall I shut
		the door?  Make your coffee?  Make
		the beds?

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		You talked to me.  Do you remember?

	The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
	control herself.  A beat.

				HELEN
		You were the one that talked about
		moonbikes and called me a crank?
		Oh God, I am!
			(to Andy)
		Make them some coffee.
			(to M.J.)
		Halloran, is it?  Investigator
		Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--
		he said...
			(a moment of real
			 fear)
		I thought it might be Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I thought he might be out
		of prison.

				RUBEN
		Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think
		so.  If he's escaped we'd have the
		National Guard, cops'd be crawling
		through sewers.  You'd have a guard
		on your front door.

				M.J.
			(looking around)
		I want to tell you it's a great
		honor to meet you and talk to you.

				HELEN
		You don't admire me.  No police
		admire me.  I got one of you
		killed.  Why don't you say right
		out what you're here for?

				M.J.
		You called us, Doctor Hudson.

				HELEN
		Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.
		The accounts of the firs two
		murders made it so clear they were
		the work of the same man, but you
		kept announcing they were
		unrelated.  You'll never catch him
		that way.

	M.J. regards her for a moment...

				M.J.
			(to Andy)
		Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
		mine black.
			(beat)
		You're absolutely correct.  The
		politicians don't want panic
		headlines spoiling the Festival of
		Love.

				HELEN
		Well, let's thank God you and
		Inspector Goetz are on the case,
		then.

				M.J.
		Would you want to work with us on
		this?

				HELEN
		Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical
		hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
		anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
		afraid of everything, real and
		imaginary.  I never leave this
		apartment now.  Nobody ever comes
		here.  I just wanted to get your
		attention.  I write and I used to
		lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
		not competent.

				M.J.
		I think you are.  I really admire
		everything you've done; it would be
		an honor to work with you, and we
		need all the help we can get,
		especially yours.

				HELEN
		Inspector Halloran, that is so much
		bullshit, you don't like or admire
		me, but the beautiful part is I
		don't give a fuck.  That's the
		upside of having a breakdown.

				M.J.
		Well, it's a hell of an apartment

		away from the projects, myself, but
		I get to go to work every day,
		wading in blood and guts.  I guess
		the books you wrote about these
		sons of bitches paid off pretty
		good.

				HELEN
		Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

				M.J.
		You can't go out lecturing?  Tough
		shit.  Women are dying.  Where can
		I lay this stuff out?

	She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
	table.

				HELEN
		I don't want this.  What are they?

				RUBEN
		You called us, Doctor, if you don't
		want to look at them here, how
		about downtown.  I'll drive you
		down...

	She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
	to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
	force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

	Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen
	fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
	back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
	FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

	THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
	she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
	treating her very gently...

				ANDY
			(to Ruben)
		Now look what you did.

				RUBEN
		What did I do?

				ANDY
		You threatened to drive her
		downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

				RUBEN
		Fear of what...

				ANDY
		Open space.  She hasn't been out of
		this apartment in three years.  I
		didn't used to think it was real...

	He's making her comfortable.

				M.J.
		We'll get the paramedics...

				ANDY
		Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
		Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:
		she hyperventilates till she passes
		out, then her breathing goes back
		to normal, and she wakes up singing
		like a lark.
			(rocking the
			 unconscious Helen)
		We know, don't we, Princess?
			(to them)
		Give her a couple of hours.  I know
		about this.

	M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is
	angry and disgusted.

				M.J.
		Tell her we're sorry we bothered
		her.

				ANDY
		Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you
		really want her help.  I mean if
		you really do, leave them.  Let her
		see them.  I'll see they're safe...

	M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
	Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
	strewn around.  Makes a decision...

				M.J.
		Tell her to ask for me...

	She's handing Andy her card...

	ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...

				M.J.
		Snotty neurotic bitch...

				RUBEN
			(amused)
		Classy madonna.

				M.J.
		Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She
		likes the way you move.  She sure
		as hell isn't in love with me.

				RUBEN
		You came in there with this
		attitude...

				M.J.
			(over him)
		Order Chinese for us and meet me
		the library?  Anything but beef.

	She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move
	to his car.  AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER
	ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.

	We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN
	HIS ARMS.  SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY.  DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE
	PHONE RING.  ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY
	DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.

	HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME.  THE SHOT
	HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT.  PHONE RINGS.

	THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER
	POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES
	ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING
	WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE
	ANDY ENTERS.  WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO
	IT.  HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.

	THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS
	RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.

	CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

				ATTORNEY
		... it was your feeling after
		careful evaluation that he was a
		sexual sadist who satisfied at
		least four out of ten criteria in
		the DMS III?

	SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
	takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
	Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of
	arrogance, which is her undoing...

				HELEN
		Yes.  Without question.

				ATTORNEY
		Without question?  He only scored
		40 percent, four out of ten
		criteria?  Couldn't another expert
		say he flunked the sexual sadist
		test?  What curve are you marking
		on, Doctor?

				HELEN
		The test criteria are only part of
		what we look at in evaluating
		subjects.

				ATTORNEY
		Only part.  What else?  What did
		you think of his claim that he tied
		this girl to the tree and set fire
		to her because Joan of Arc told him
		to do it.

				HELEN
		He was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked
		you what you thought, not what he
		did.

				HELEN
		I thought he was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		You said, first, he was lying.  How
		do you know that, Doctor?

				HELEN
		Because people who are suffering
		from aural hallucinations hear
		voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee
		told me that Joan of Arc always
		appeared beside him on his left
		side and spoke softly in his left
		ear.

	Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

				HELEN
			(emboldened)
		He took pains to hide his actions
		because he knew they were morally
		wrong.  He was not acting on mad
		impulse.  He was sane and acting
		out a pattern he carefully followed
		every time.

				ATTORNEY
			(playing causal)
		What pattern was that?

				HELEN
		The same as the first time...

	She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
	tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
	Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
	by the line this questioning is taking.

				ATTORNEY
		The first what?
			(as she hesitates)
		Your Honor, she's got this far, I
		think she should finish.  I don't
		think this jury should be left
		wondering where the rest of her
		statement would lead.

				JUDGE
		I agree, Doctor.

				HELEN
		The first two murders.

				ATTORNEY
		What first two murders.  We don't
		know about them here, do we?

				HELEN
			(giving up)
		He told me he had done two others
		just like it.

				ATTORNEY
		When was that?

				HELEN
		When he was seventeen.

				ATTORNEY
		And you believed him when he told
		you he had done that.

				HELEN
		Yes.  I believed him.

	The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

				JUDGE (V.O.)
		Yes, I'll accept a call for a
		mistrial.  Evidence of that other
		crime when the defendant was a
		juvenile is inadmissible and never
		should have been heard by this
		jury...

	FREEZE FRAMES.

	NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,
	THINKING...

	THE DOOR OPENS AND QUINN ENTERS.

				QUINN
		There was no sperm.

				M.J.
		The same as the firs two.
		Definitely a serial.

				QUINN
			(seeing HELEN on

		What are you looking at that for?
		Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

				M.J.
		What clues?  I'm going to work
		Helen Hudson.

				QUINN
		Would you step outside, Sergeant?

	M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN.  Once the door shuts,
	he turns tape back to 'play.'

	EXT. OUTSIDE DOOR TO LIBRARY - DAY

				QUINN
		I'm telling you.  Don't you ever
		address me publicly in that tone.
		You'll work what and who I tell you
		to work.

				M.J.
		Anybody in this department ever
		worked a serial killer case?  She's
		the expert.  I need help.

				QUINN
		How about I put Nikko on it?

				M.J.
		That's always your privilege, sir.

	QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

				QUINN
		Sergeant?

				M.J.
		Yessir.

				QUINN
		You ever reflect how this big
		explosion in dead women coincides
		with the flowering of women's lib?

				M.J.
		Yessir.  I have reflected on that,
		sir.  Which explains my gushing
		deference to you, sir.

	QUINN is somehow cheered by this little exchange.

		Reminded me that I used to be

			(big beat)
		About what?

	ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at

				HELEN
		I can't, Andy.

				ANDY
		Then, why don't you just die.  I'm

	WE SEE THE PATTERN HELEN DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		The way he's posed the bodies...
		he's flaunting his power to do
		whatever he wants to her.  This
		man... He probably seems perfectly
		normal.  These murders are organized
		and planned.

	WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
	IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one
	picture from the rest...

				HELEN
		Except for this one.  You put that
		one in to test me.

	M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>

	INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with
	bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Is it an ongoing case?

	BACK TO SCENE...

				M.J.
			(nods)
		For months... last October.

				HELEN
		It was a lover or a husband.
		Someone close.  Somebody who knew
		her and cared about her.

				M.J.
			(glancing at Ruben)
		How do you know that?

				HELEN
		He felt remorse.  He covered her.

	HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

				HELEN
		The bodies have been carefully
		arranged... different positions,
		but somehow the same.  The
		positions are brutal... yet
		quite... artful.  It's like... a
		signature.  He's proud of his
		accomplishments.  There are early
		Picassos and late Picassos, but you
		always recognize the hand.  He
		wants us to recognize his hand.
		I've seen this hand before... what
		are you hiding?

				M.J.
			(taken aback)
		Nothing.

				HELEN
		Where are the stockings he
		strangled them with?

				M.J.
		How did you know they were
		stockings?

				HELEN
			(sarcastic)
		I sent Andy out on murder missions.
		For God's sake -- it's the Boston
		Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used
		their own stockings to strangle
		them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

	She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
	pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

				HELEN
		Somebody is imitating his m.o.
		Look for a plumber or carpenter or
		handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
		the door and caught them off guard.

				RUBEN
		The Boston Strangler, when was
		that...?

				HELEN
		In the sixties.  He's dead --
		stabbed to death in prison.

				M.J.
		Why imitate a dead serial killer?

				HELEN
		If you knew why, you might know
		where to look for him.
		I don't envy you this; he's not
		done -- he's going to do them faster
		and faster to keep the adrenaline
		rush.  Now, I've done what you 
		asked me.

				M.J.
		Work with me.

				ANDY (O.S.)
		It's good for you.

	They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

				ANDY
		It's good medicine.

		the pictures.

	They pass through a door into a ROOM where the homicide team
	sit waiting... M.J. goes right into a briefing...

				M.J.
		We saw it.  The unknown target is
		kneeling, she's gardening.  Red
		hair, high cheekbones, mid-
		thirties, height I don't know,
		she's not overweight, she's
		zofting... She's in front of a
		house that looks like...

	EXT. MARINA HOUSE - LATE DAY

	As she is speaking, her description becomes V.O. as we SEE
	police cars and an ambulance drawn up IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
	SHE IS DESCRIBING...

				M.J. (V.O.)
		... the Marina area, there was
		earthquake damage repair on the
		house it looked like, a little
		garden.  The light was late
		afternoon.  Say about cocktail
		hour.  He was bringing out drinks,
		margaritas by the look.  So we got
		a house facing west, on the east
		side of the street.  Full sun, so
		there's no high trees or buildings,
		residential both sides.

	SUSAN SCHIFFER and her crew arrive, leaping out of their van
	with their equipment, a makeup woman ADJUSTING SUSAN'S
	MAKEUP AND HAIR RIGHT THERE IN THE STREET...

	M.J. and Ruben, Quinn, etc., trying to calm and/or question
	the HUSBAND, who is in shock.  He is the man we saw bringing
	drinks.

				HUSBAND
		Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poker
		game!  Always have to s-stay until
		Phil makes a c...comeback.  Am I
		stuttering?

	The husband's voice follows QUINN and others as another COP
	leads them toward the back of house.

	DOOR TO BEDROOM.  QUINN AND RUBEN have stopped just inside
	door.  M.J. forced to peer around them.

	M.J.'S POV: On the bed, the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S body is
	propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head
	fallen onto a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open
	and pushed up.  Knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied
	in a huge bow under her chin.  On her feet, secured between
	her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising the Festival of
	Love.  It is brightly printed with red hearts.  It has been
	hand-lettered:

	HELL IN THE FESTIVAL OF LOVE

	EXT. FESTIVAL OF LOVE IN GOLDEN STATE PARK - NIGHT

	CAMCORDER capturing the audience of a ROCK CONCERT in full
	blast, in GOLDEN GATE PARK.  The audience, mostly young,

	seem to have some variety of refreshment... liquid or rolled.
	The CAMERA records the unsteady progress of a lovely YOUNG
	GIRL, weaving her way through the blankets and the bodies.
	She suddenly becomes aware of the camera being aimed at her.
	She stops, strikes a comically seductive pose and gives a
	big, gorgeous smile.  FREEZE FRAME.

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	ANDY answers the door.  M.J. and Ruben...

				ANDY
		She just got to sleep.  Do you have
		to tell her about it now?

				M.J.
		Tell her about what?

				ANDY
			(mock admiration)
		Gaahhd!  What a cop!  You busted
		me!
			(real)
		The new one, in the Marina.
			(to their reaction)
		She has a police radio scanner.
		It's always on.  She turns it off,
		and then she has to turn it on
		again.  She's obsessed.  She can't
		not listen to it, but she can't
		listen to it, so she makes me
		listen to it.

	HELEN APPEARS IN WHATEVER SHE SLEEPS IN.

				HELEN
		I am not going to look at any more
		pictures.  They're like a disease.
		They get into my head.  I can't get
		them out.

				M.J.
		I don't look at pictures.  I look
		at the real thing.  I don't feel
		infected.

				HELEN
		Maybe that's why you can't catch
		him.  I know what she looks like --
		the red-headed woman in my
		computer.

				M.J.
		I just came from her... here's what
		you haven't seen.

	M.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her
	manner is that of cop with a witness.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		A forgery of the Mary Sullivan
		murder scene, he's done it perfect.
		Except for the sign.

				HELEN
			(looking at photo)
		She probably let him in the door
		without a thought.  Where are their
		mothers?!  Where are the mothers
		that are supposed to teach them to
		be wary and to tough and not afraid
		to fight?

				M.J.
		Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
		Festival of Love?  You make any
		sense in that?

	HELEN stares at the picture.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
		talking to you.

				HELEN
		It's anybody connected to author-
		ity.  They write, they even knock
		on your door.  They're fans.  It
		thrills them to flirt with getting
		caught.

				M.J.
		Nobody knows you have anything to
		do with this case; nothing has been
		on TV or the news... Why would he
		want to get in your computer?

				HELEN
		Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!
		His, all of them!  They know me.
		They're in prisons with libraries,
		they collect clippings, I'm their
		worthy opponent.  You keep my name
		out of this.

				RUBEN
		Absolutely.

				M.J.
		My promise.

	Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.

				ANDY
		The moon is up, my night to howl.
		Will you be okay?

				HELEN
		Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You
		go.  Poor thing, you ought to get
		out.

				ANDY
			(to M.J.)
		Look out for her.  She's tougher
		than you think.

	He goes...

				HELEN
		I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest
		of it?

				RUBEN
		MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

				HELEN
		MaryJane.  You think that logic and
		police procedure, order and science
		and method will hold back the
		horrors of a world gone mad and the
		sickness of the night.  I did once.
		But you know how he'll get caught?
		He'll have an accident, or some cop
		will get lucky.  You can't catch
		him by being intelligent and
		working hard.  Or the worst:  there
		are dozens of women slaughtered in
		the most horrible way, month after
		month.  The news stories grow more
		grotesque and bizarre and in the
		city people lock their doors and
		windows, and hurry home before
		dark.  And then, one day, there are
		no more.  What happened?  Did he
		just stop?  Get tired and disgusted
		and decide not to kill any more?
		Did he kill himself?  Did he die in
		an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
		get sick and die?  It's like the
		murderer walked off the edge of the
		earth.  And you never know.  But
		you keep asking yourself -- when you
		read about a new murder -- is he
		back?

	M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
	story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

				M.J.
		That's amazing.  A whole new book,
		thought up in a minute.  Very good.
			(beat)
		All I know how t do is get up,
		take a shower, and go to work.
		Hope, if he does another I'll nail
		the son of bitch, and they'll spell
		my name right in the newspaper.
		Where is Andy going?

				HELEN
		He's going home.  He slept over
		because I was a little anxious...

				M.J.
		I want a guard on you.  I'm worried
		about leaving you alone.

				RUBEN
			(to M.J.)
		We're through for the night, aren't
		we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.
		I'll stay until we can get a man
		out here and maybe catch a cab
		home.

				HELEN
		That would be much appreciated.
		Thanks.

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		Somewhere down the line we're doing
		to find a connection between him
		and you.  I want you to worry that
		idea like a loose tooth.

	Three voices chime self-conscious 'Good-nights.'

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	THE SILENT WATCHER'S POV through the eye of the
	CAMCORDER, we catch M.J. exit HELEN'S building.  She stops
	momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window...
	The drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT
	THE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.
	She gets into her car and speeds off.

	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben is checking the windows...

				RUBEN
		You ought to get some decent locks
		on these.  A six-year-old could get
		in here.  Much less a motivated
		man.

	At the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the
	eye.
  				HELEN
		You and MaryJane aren't lovers.

				RUBEN
		Not yet.

	HELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her laughter,
	attracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the
	heat.

				HELEN
		Are you always so bold?

				RUBEN
		No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

	His grin says he'd select her anytime...

				RUBEN
		The problem for me is... you're in
		the witness category.
			(beat -- Jack
			 Nicholson)
		Know what I mean?

				HELEN
		Well.  Another time, then.
			(beat)
		I'll be all right.  He's not going
		to attack me; what I' m rally
		afraid of is all in my own head,
		Ruben.

	They smile ruefully at one another, and without further
	conversation, leave the bedroom.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	RUBEN is outside the door.  HELEN just inside.

				RUBEN
		They'll have a guard here tomorrow.
		I know you have the idea, but it'll
		make me feel a lot better.

	She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the
	doorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he
	suddenly stops.

				RUBEN
		Hey!

	He turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches
	for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

				RUBEN
		The number for my cellular.

				RUBEN
		Don't hesitate.  Anytime.  Night or
		day.  I mean that.

	He hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door
	frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
	with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
	in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
	HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
	determined not to have any further mortification this night,
	she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
	Then a second step and a third.

	Her hand touches the card, takes it.

	She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
	What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
	quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
	Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

	HER POV:

	RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
	turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
	narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
	miles and miles of space between the two walls.

				HELEN
		Oh, God!  Help me!

	RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

				RUBEN
		Tell me what to do!

				HELEN
		I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

	She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
	catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
	a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
	spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
	is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
	panic...

				HELEN
		...falling... FALLING!

	He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
	her against the feeling of free-fall.

				RUBEN
		I'm right here.  I won't let you
		fall.

	He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
	proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
	begins to hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		Don't let go... I can't breathe...
		I'll die!

				RUBEN
		Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
		I'll fix it...

	RUBEN takes out his gun...

				RUBEN
		Put your hands over your ears.

	RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
	carries her back into her apartment.

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
	up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
	to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
	water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
	takes the bottle and pockets it.

				HELEN
		The lock...

				RUBEN
		I'll get a locksmith.

				HELEN
		Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
		to sleep... I don't want...him...in
		my head...

	RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
	close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
	nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

	CLOSE UP HELEN:

	We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

				V.O.
		Peter... Peter...

							CROSS FADE TO:

	INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

	Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
	comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
	She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
	older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
	DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
	video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

	THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

	PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
	Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
	his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
	the tape on 'eject.'

				WOMAN
		Put in the Kevin Costner.

				PETER
		Why don't we save it for later?
		It's almost time for Letterman.

				WOMAN
		You know I don't like to watch talk
		shows by myself.  Where're you?

	He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
	approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
	lock of hair back from the forehead.

	She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
	DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.

				WOMAN
		See, now you've annoyed her.  You
		know she doesn't like you to touch
		me.
			(to dog)
		Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
		you so much!
			(to Peter)
		Did you feed her?

				PETER
		Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's
		hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

				WOMAN
		She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
		her?

				PETER
		She lies all the time.  Why would I
		say I fed her if I didn't?

				WOMAN
		That's what I don't know.  Why
		would you lie?  That's the
		problem... I can't understand why
		anyone would lie.

	He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
	to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

				WOMAN (cont'd)
		You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
		you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
		Such a naughty widdle dog...

	HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
	small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
	then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
	basement door behind him.

	THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
	and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
	small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
	freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
	outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

	PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
	something to turn the video back on.

	The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
	the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
	table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
	but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
	asphyxiated by slow degrees.

	PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
	repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
	toward his wife.  He whispers:

				PETER
		Didn't I promise I'd come right
		back?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

	ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
	glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
	down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
	of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
	few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
	CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
	number of unmarked cars.

	RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

	As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
	THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
	stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
	away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

				RUBEN
		Up all night with a sick friend.

	NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

				NIKKO
		You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
		even know how to treat a woman.

				RUBEN
		Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
		me why she gave you the boot...

	He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
	WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
	now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
	a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
	photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

				RUBEN
		Is Niccoletti assigned here?

				M.J.
			(angry about it)
		Quinn decided we should form a task
		force -- they're all one case, now.
		He wants all the senior detectives
		on it...
			(to Doc)
		She wasn't killed here.

				DOC
		Not likely.

	M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
	beside her... to Ruben...

				M.J.
		Tell me what you see.

	He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

				RUBEN
		She didn't fight back, no hair or
		skin under her fingernails.  I'm
		not seeing any bruises or
		contusions...

				M.J.
		What about her arms?

				RUBEN
		Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at
		this...

	Nikko appears, looming over her...

				NIKKO
		Probably so stoned she never knew
		what got her.  Like Goetz's sick
		friend.  Right Goetz?

	They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

				RUBEN
		She's blue as hell.  No marks on her
		neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --
		no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

				M.J.
		Look at her legs.

				RUBEN
		Spread out like she was sexually
		assaulted here.

				DOC
		After she was dead.

				RUBEN
		She was dragged up here from the
		road, you can see the tracks.  She
		was already dead or unconscious.
		Let's get plaster casts on any --
		all footprints.

				M.J.
		If this is just the dump site,
		where did he do the job?  Where did
		he pick her up?

				NIKKO
		Doped up kids all over town.  Park
		was full of them last night.  Very
		easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

	Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
	Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
	them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

				M.J.
		What the hell are you doing?  The
		Mouth and the Haircut are right
		down there, thank God they didn't
		see that.

	Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
	of-Lovers.

				M.J.
		Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
		side of the tape, you want to push
		them back?  Now.

	Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
	RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
	her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
	hillside to their cars...

				M.J.
		Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
		on report.

				RUBEN
		You're right.  I can't stand that
		bastard.  Sorry.
			(getting back to
			 work)
		This is something new.  Not the
		same guy, that's for sure.

				M.J.
		Yeah, everything's different.

	But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

				M.J.
		Get the pictures, and casts of
		footprints.

				RUBEN
		Look at him, grandstanding...

	Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

				M.J.
		That's all we need...

	She strides toward them...

				M.J.
		Detective Niccoletti?

				SUSAN
		What's this about the Boston
		Strangler, M.J.?

	M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also
	thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
	this point -- or not?

				M.J.
		Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
		the wrong side of the tape.  We're
		still trying to find any footprints
		or tire marks and we don't want to
		chew up the ground, okay?  I'll
		talk to you later.
			(to Nikko)
		You, too.

	She's got Susan outside the tape...

				SUSAN
		Inspector, will you confirm
		somebody is copying the Boston
		Strangler?  This is the fourth, is
		that correct?

				M.J.
		We're going to review all the
		evidence carefully before making
		any statement...

	She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
	side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

				M.J.
		Ruben, put the light on...

	From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
	clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

	M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
	car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
	trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
	familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

				M.J.
		Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,
		never, never mess with somebody
		inside the case!

				RUBEN
		Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do
		you...

				M.J.
		You damn well better start working
		on that impulse control.  A woman
		who is implicated in this case?
		Someone who's practically a piece
		of evidence?

				RUBEN
		It's against your rules that I try
		to help a witness who's scared
		shitless?  Who's...

				M.J.
		The woman's unstable.  You could
		wind up with a harassment charge.
		Anything.  You're like some horny
		little teenager.

	M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
	mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
	tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

				M.J.
		Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
		about that corner.

	Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

				M.J.
		Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
		same clothes from yesterday,
		reeking of sex.

	RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot
	and jumps out.

				M.J.
			(going away)
		Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get
		Doc to lean on the coroner for a
		really fast prelim on the sperm.

	RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

				M.J. (O.S.)
		When you get it, call me.

	RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

				RUBEN
		She loves me.

	QUINN, NICCOLETTI.

				QUINN
		I know; the kid hit you first.  He

				NIKKO
		He's not treating her right...

				QUINN
		She left you, Nikko.  She's not
		your responsibility.  She takes
		very good care of herself.  If she
		wants to romance the kid, it ain't
		your business.  Your business is to

				NIKKO
		We were together six years, sir!

				QUINN
		Don't give me six years!  You never
		divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd
		you expect from M.J.?

				NIKKO
		She knows I'm Catholic!  She never
		mentioned divorce!  Not once!

				QUINN
		Then you shoulda known she wasn't
		buying.  She was just long-term
		leasing' you.

		Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare

		nothin' about sex I don't hate.
		But of course, I'm Irish.

		Plus I got real problems.  I'm

		how can I move you in, if you go on

				NIKKO
		I don't want the job.  Don't do

	She walks away BECKONS, BECKONS, COME ON, WALK AFTER ME!  He
	walks out of a door and they stand on the steps...

	EXT. STEPS POLICE HQ - DAY

	A couple of Cops, maybe male and female, are smoking there.
	Quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside,
	flipping their butts into the shrubbery.  Quinn sighs and
	digs out a cigarette.  The looks between them tell the story
	of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc.

				QUINN
		So what have we got?

				M.J.
		It's not the same guy.  It should be
		a self-solver.  No bow around the
		neck, left and body outdoors,
		completely different.  The others
		were housewives, secretaries, he
		talked his way inside, killed them
		in their own living room or bed- or
		bathroom.  This one didn't have a
		husband or a boyfriend, no family,
		temp waitress, 3 arrests for
		misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI,
		asphyxiation probably from a
		plastic bag over her head.  Sexually
		assaulted.  The others weren't
		molested that way.  We're waiting
		for the sperm tests...

				QUINN
		Christ.  How old are you?  You sure
		you want to be in this line of
		work?

				M.J.
		You're damn right I do.

				QUINN
		Okay, now what about your sidekick
		punching my favorite detective?
		What the hell is going on?  You got
		no discipline in your operation.

				M.J.
		I'm sorry it had to come to your
		attention.  I am dealing with it.

	She starts to go...

				QUINN
		Where you going?

				M.J.
		Helen Hudson...

				QUINN
		What the hell you need her for?

				M.J.
		Because I think I'm wrong.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  SHAKING HANDS DUMP OUT PILLS.  FOUR.
	SIX.  TWO, PUT BACK.  ONE MORE, PUT BACK.

	HELEN: RAVAGED.  WATCHING HERSELF IN MIRROR AS SHE GULPS THE
	REMAINING PILLS.

	DOOR BELL RINGS O.S.

				HELEN
		I'm not seeing anybody.

	We HEAR muffled voices -- ANDY and M.J.  HELEN, as she
	realizes Andy is letting M.J. in, goes to the bathroom door
	and tries to slam and lock it: Andy beats her to it,
	blocking with his foot in the door.

				HELEN
		You're fired.

				ANDY
		I know.  Do come and meet your
		guest.

	M.J. appears.  Taking in Helen's condition -- due to a wild
	night with Ruben?  Helen moves from the bathroom down the
	hall to her office, as...

				M.J.
		We've got another one.

				HELEN
		That's no surprise.

				M.J.
		But it's a different m.o.

				HELEN
		Then what do you need me for?

				M.J.
		She was killed somewhere else and
	dumped outdoors in an empty lot.
		Where it says "no dumping."  Her
		legs pulled apart in a kind of
		sexual pose.   It's all different
		but it seems so -- the same.
		Artificial and posed... Something's
		wrong with it.

				HELEN
		You're saying it's the same man,
		but he's changed his style?  That
		doesn't happen.  These men are
		robotic; the murder is like a
		ritual.  The method itself is part
		of the pleasure...

	They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

				M.J.
		Who turned off the Internet
		computer...

				HELEN
		I turned it off.  It's like an open
		window he can climb right in...

				M.J.
		He comes in the window, we maybe
		grab him.  Where's the on-switch?

				HELEN
		Have you got a warrant?  Get the
		hell out o here!  This is the
		only space I have left in the
		world!  Why can't you leave me out
		of it?

				M.J.
		Helen -- the killer directly
		contacted you.  His interest in you
		is intense.  I'm worried about you.
		I don't want to lose you.  I know
		this stirs up every monster under
		the bed, but this is the only
		direct contact we have with him.
		The only chance we have to trap
		him.
			(beat)
		So, you can turn Internet back on,
		or I do, and we put somebody here
		on a 24 hour shift and you can
		kick, scream and hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		That little Winona Ryder manner...
		you're more convincing as Clint
		Eastwood.

				M.J.
		Clint is putting a guard on you.
		But if you swear to leave the
		computer on, Winona will assign him
		to the hall outside.

	HELEN has to laugh.  The laugh turns to a hacking cough.

				ANDY
		She's smoking again.

	Andy leaves.  Helen sits, and with the care of someone
	handling a rattlesnake, turns the computer on.  Meanwhile...

	THE PHONE RINGS.

				HELEN
		Hello?... Oh...
			(a beat)
		...yes, she's right here.

	HELEN hangs the phone to M.J.  The air is a little more
	charged... Helen goes back to the computer.

				HELEN
		Ruben.

				M.J.
		Hello, Ruben...
			(listens, nods)
		So that's that...

				HELEN
		Please thank Inspector Goetz for
		taking care of me last night.

	M.J. delivers the message straight-faced.

				M.J.
		Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to
		thank you for taking care of her
		last night.
			(hangs up)
		Lab report on the new one.  At
		least two guys penetrated her.
		There were two kinds of sperm.  The
		poor thing.  What it must have been
		like.

	Helen has come alert...

				HELEN
		She was near a sign that said "No
		Dumping?"  Two kinds of sperm --
		the lab said one was a secretor and
		the other was not?

	M.J. mumbles a surprised yes.  Helen is at computer.

				HELEN
		There were needle marks.  But no
		drugs in her blood.

				M.J.
		So far nothing they test for comes
		up positive.

	Helen has a Window type screen: she clicks icons...

				HELEN
		Is that it?

				M.J.
			(stunned)
		That's exactly... I could have
		taken that same picture, this
		morning.

	A RATHER GRAINY PICTURE OF A DEAD GIRL SPREAD OUT IN A
	SUGGESTIVE POSE IN AN EMPTY FIELD.  A SIGN RIGHT BY HER SAYS
	"NO DUMPING."

				HELEN
		He's switched from DeSalvo to the
		Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler
		was two men, that's why there are
		two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a
		joke, very witty our boy.

				M.J.
		That's not consistent... You said
		they never changed their style,
		they're robots...

				HELEN
		Consistency is the hobgoblin of
		little minds.  Tell them to test
		for the chemicals found in Windex.
		That's a product for cleaning
		with...

				M.J.
		I know Windex, for God's sake, I
		clean my own windows...

				HELEN
		It's what Bianchi and Buono
		injected into one of their victims.

				M.J.
			(sensing something
			 appalling)
		Injected Windex!  Why would he
		switch to a new m.o.?

				HELEN
		Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
		way to nailing him.  Serial killing
		is irrational and rigid and 
		compulsive.  This guy has a plan
		all thought out, flexible and
		complex.  He's playing a game with
		us.  Who will he imitate next?
		Maybe he's doing all the serial
		killers in history, the great
		innovators, the murderers' hall of
		fame.  Just to prove he's better
		than all of them.  They got caught;
		he didn't.

				M.J.
		He'll get caught.  If he has a plan
		that'll be what trips him up...

				HELEN
		Who's going to catch him?  You?
			(beat)
		And if you do, there'll be another
		one.  And one after that.

				M.J.
			(gently, surprised)
		You're afraid of him.

				HELEN
		This one, yes.  I was always
		curious about these twisted little 
		souls, but this is the first one
		I've felt personally terrified of.
		He's something new and unheard of.
		I don't know what he wants.

				M.J.
			(beat)
		I'm giving you Clint outside.

	INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is empty, the messy unmade bed has covers thrown
	back.  Nasty Little Dog is sprawled asleep on it.  The TV is
	on: SUSAN SCHIFFER'S broadcast... Over SUSAN'S shoulder, big
	and bold, the legend:

	'KOPYCAT KILLER?'

				SUSAN
		...to mimic the M.O. of the Boston
		Strangler.  The police here are
		rumored to be consulting Dr. Helen
		Hudson.

	O.S.  A TOILET FLUSHES, and Peter's WIFE emerges wearing a
	nightgown.  She shuffles back to the bed, and as she sits
	picks up the remote...

				SUSAN (ON TV)
		It was backstage at the McClusky
		Auditorium on the Berkeley campus
		that Dr. Hudson's police bodyguard
		was killed.  Daryll Lee Cullum,
		that...

	She zaps the remote and a program hyping the Summer of Love
	comes on...

	INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	We see on HIS computer screen a picture of HELEN scanned
	from some newspaper or magazine.  PETER is building a morph:
	beside Helen on screen is another image -- of the RED-HEADED
	woman.  He is placing marks on one picture, on the exact
	corner of Helen's left eyes.  As he does so, a red dot
	appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed
	woman.  Both pictures are dappled with similar dots.  It
	looks very odd, as though someone had stuck Post-its all
	over the images.  Around him, as he works are other pictures:
	ASPHYXIATED GIRL taken while she was strapped to the table.
	Of the sign "NO DUMPING."  M.J. leaving Helen's!  HE ALSO HAS
	A TINY TV ON, AND TURNS TO SEE AS:

				SUSAN (ON TV)
		... convicted serial killer had
		escaped police custody during a
		court hearing, in a scandal that
		rocked the police and forced the
		resignation of four State
		Correction officers...

	INT. DEATH ROW CELL - NIGHT

	DARYLL LEE lies smoking and watching a tiny TV of his own.

				SUSAN (ON TV)
		...Cullum attacked Doctor Hudson in
		apparent revenge for her testimony
		against him.  Doctor Hudson did not
		return our phone calls, today.  Our
		sources tell us that if police
		homicide detectives fail to move
		faster in their investigation the
		FBI will be called...

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

	M.J. striding, tight-lipped through the room to her
	workstation where she takes the phone from Ruben...

				M.J.
		Halloran.

	INTERCUT:

				HELEN
		You betrayed me!  Now every
		psychopath in the city knows I'm
		back in business... You lied to me!

				M.J.
		I did not; the Mouth -- that's what
		we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on
		her own.

				HELEN
		Why should I trust you?

				M.J.
		Because I'm all you've got.

	RUBEN HAS BEEN GIVEN NEWS: BIG PROBLEMS.  MEN AND WOMEN ARE
	GETTING UP, PUTTING ON HOLSTERS, ETC., MOVING OUT...

				HELEN
		How could you...

				M.J.
			(out of patience)
		I like the real smart Helen Hudson
		a lot, I'm Goddamned sick and 
		tired of the hysterical little
		girl, Helen.  You asked your way in
		-- I don't forget that.  You've got
		a nickname around here -- "Deep
		Throat" from all the phone calls, I
		wonder if you know that.  Go take a
		xanax, I've got to got to work.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN, her police scanner sounding distant tinny cries in
	the night:  Helen holding the phone, digesting that...

				SCANNER (VARIOUS VOICES)
		987...  Carol Meany, call your
		home?  We have...  don't step on
		me, damn it!  Go to channel 8...
		Code Red -- Homicide at 16th Avenue
		and Horgan, woman dead in car.  Can
		we have homicide?  All units go to
		channel 5.  Leave channel 3 clear
		for homicide... etc.

	EXT. HELEN'S STREET - NIGHT

	A MAN parks a car.  He gets out.  He is dressed entirely in
	black.  Glancing around to be sure he is not observed, the
	MAN moves to cars, banging them hard with his hand until he
	SETS OFF A CAR ALARM.  He trots silently to HELEN'S side of
	the street and merges into the dark side of her building.
	THE ALARM GOES INFURIATINGLY ON.  A light comes on in an
	upstairs window...

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	BURT, the cop on guard, marginally irritated by the car
	alarm, looks up briefly, then returns to his magazine.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RICHMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT

	CAR WHERE A WOMAN HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD.  KLIEG LIGHTS PAINT
	HER FEATURES A BLEAK WHITE ON BLACK.  M.J. and RUBEN work
	the scene along with the CRIME TECH CREW.

	One of the TECH GUYS holds up a bullet.

				TECH GUY
		Pulled this out of the door, it's
		bigger than a .38; it's a .44 or 9
		millimeter.

	CLOSE: M.J. is crawling along the floor, looking at
	everything she can find -- gum wrappers, hobby pins, loose
	change, etc.  She lifts her head and finds the car radio and
	tape player right in her face.

				M.J.
		Was this on?  When you found the
		car was the tape player on or off.

				COP (V.O.)
		It was on, auto-reverse, over and
		over.

	M.J. has rubber gloves on.  She switches on ignition and the
	tape player starts:  ABBA.  A phone rings...

	ON RUBEN standing beside the car; he answers his phone...

				RUBEN
		Yeah?... I can't talk now...
		What?... No.  There's no sexual
		assault, it's a drive-by, a woman
		in a car, it's not him.
			(mouths to M.J.)
		Helen.

	M.J. still pissed at the earlier phone call, turns away,
	dismissively...

				HELEN (V.O.)
		It's a woman shot in a car?

				RUBEN
		Yes.  I have to go...

				HELEN
		She on the passenger side?

				M.J.
			(shouting to be
			 heard)
		Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on
		with his work...

				HELEN
		What's that music.  It's Abba.  I
		can hear it.  It's Abba.

				RUBEN
		What's Abba?

				M.J.
		Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too
		young.

	Dread clouds HELEN'S face.  She is calling up databases,
	screens scrolling across her computer monitor.

				HELEN
		Don't hang up!

				RUBEN
		What?...

				HELEN
		Listen to me.  Is there a gas
		station nearby?

	RUBEN look around, sees a gas station across the street and
	further down the block...

				RUBEN
		Yes.

				HELEN
		Is there a phone booth there?

				RUBEN
		They all have one...

				HELEN
		Go and look for a note.

	RUBEN hands the phone over to M.J.

				RUBEN
		She wants me to check the phone
		booth for a note.

				M.J.
		Helen... excuse me, we...

	ON HELEN'S SCREEN IS THE FACE OF BERKOWITZ... SHE CALLS UP
	ADDITIONAL FRAMES SHOWING SCENES OF HIS CRIMES.

				HELEN
		She was listening to Abba in her
		parked car when she was shot with a
		Bulldog .44.

	M.J. reacts:  the scene of what Helen is saying hits her
	hard.  This is repeating the pattern of yet another
	killer...

				M.J.
		Tony!

	The techie who pulled the bullet out of the door turns...

				M.J.
		Let me see the slug outta the door!

	He pulls a baggie out his pocket and hands it to her...

	RUBEN RUNNING across to the gas station.  He's alone now,
	the blazing lights of the crime scene recede.

	EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	A small annoyed crowd has gathered around the are whose
	alarm is still shrieking.

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	BURT finally gets up, goes to window, sees situation,
	decides to go and fix it.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

	M.J. still on phone to HELEN.  She's just got the bullet out
	of the baggie; Tony stands watching.

				M.J.
		What's that siren?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		One of those goddamned car alarms.
		What's going...

				M.J.
		Ruben's gone to look... It's banged
		up but it looks like a .44.  It's
		Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?

				HELEN
		Look in the crowd.  He liked to
		hang around and watch the cops at
		work...

	EXT. SHELL STATION - NIGHT

	Closed.  RUBEN at the phone booth.

	A note lies on the shelf, handwritten in felt-tip pen.  He
	puts on a rubber glove, picks note up by one corner.

	CRIME SCENE:

	RUBEN has taken phone back from M.J.  He is reading the note
	to HELEN.  M.J., agitated, stands by.

				RUBEN
		"Police: let me haunt you with
		these words:  I'll be back."

	M.J. notices that there is writing on the other side of the
	note.  She forces RUBEN'S gloved hand to turn note over.

				RUBEN
		Hold on a minute, Helen...

	By this time M.J. has seen that this part is addressed to
	HELEN.  M.J. takes phone from RUBEN, forcing herself to
	sound casual.

				M.J.
		Helen, Ruben's going to drop by.
		He's got some questions.

	She hangs up, RUBEN is already on his way.  M.J. calls a
	number...

				M.J.
		Answer me!!...

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The beeper on Burt's belt is beeping, but his head is under
	the hood of the car where the car alarm is blaring.  He
	can't hear the beeper...  

	BACK TO CRIME SCENE:

	M.J. ends the call, yells to another Detective.

				M.J.
		I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda
		Drive.  Tell them to approach code
		2 and wait for instruction.  Find
		the goddamn officer supposed to be
		on security.  Ruben's on his way.
		He'll go in alone.

	SHE TURNS AND SEES:

	BEHIND YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE THE NIGHT IS FULL OF THRILL
	SEEKERS AND CURIOUS.  WHICH OF THEM MIGHT BE THE KILLER?
	THE GUY IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON
	SUDDENLY BEGINS TO RACE ALONG BEHIND THE ONLOOKERS?  THE MEN
	WHO DUCKS TO TIE HIS SHOE WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER SHOOTS A
	PICTURE?

	INT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The horn blares across the street, (O.S.).  No one notices
	the MAN at HELEN'S door, swiftly fiddling the lock with a
	ring full of burglars' keys and picks.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is putting on makeup (Ruben is coming).  A small but
	alarming noise at the front of the loft.  She listens
	carefully, and moves to the door looking down the hall
	toward the front door.  It is OPEN"  Burt is not there!

	She hesitates a moment, then turns off the lights and
	sprints for the front door, to escape.

	INT. LIVING ROOM

	THE MAN IS PULLING A BALACLAVA UP OVER HIS FACE.  AS HE HEARS
	HER HE STEPS TO THE...

	INSERT: TELEPHONE

	A HAND IN A FINE LEATHER BLACK GLOVE LIFTS THE RECEIVER OFF
	THE HOOK.

	HELEN RUNS DOWN THE HALL AND REACHES THE FRONT DOOR.  SHE
	RUNS RIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL A FEW STEPS BEFORE RECOILING:

	HER POV.  THE WALLS AND FLOOR WEAVING AND CONTRACTING...
	AGORAPHOBIA HAS HIT.

	HELEN FALLS.  SHE SCRAMBLES IN TERROR BACK TO THE "SAFETY"
	OF HER WALL, NOW A CAVE OF DARKNESS.

	SHE FALLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL, GASPING FOR BREATH.

	LIVING ROOM.  THE MAN MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM TOWARD THE
	HALL.

							CUT TO:

	RUBEN:  taking the hills fast.

	THE MAN: STEPS OUT INTO THE HALL.

	HELEN:  SHE HAS RUN BACK THE LENGTH OF THE HALL TO HER
	OFFICE.  SHE IS JUST VANISHING AS THE MAN STEPS TO WHERE HE
	CAN SEE HER.

	THE MAN STARTS TO FOLLOW, NOT FAST, BUT WITH TERRIFYING
	SURENESS...

	THE POLICE SCANNER SUDDENLY COMES UP LOUD.  HE HESITATES.

	HELEN:  HER REMOTE CONTROLS IN HAND SWITCHES ON TV SETS,
	LAMPS, ETC.

	THE MAN:  HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN, TOWARD WHERE HE BELIEVES
	SHE IS.  HE IS PASSING A WINDOW, WHEN THE CURTAINS SUDDENLY
	DRAW, RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  HE PAUSES AGAIN, LOOKS DOWN AND WE
	AND HE/WE SEE THE STREET SCENE: BURT AND NEIGHBORS TRYING TO
	SILENCE THE CAR ALARM.  THEN HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN.

	THE CURTAINS CLOSE.

	HIGH ANGLE OVER THE MAZE OF THE APARTMENT WALLS.  WE CAN SEE
	THE MAN MOVING ALONG THE HALLWAY AGAIN -- TOWARD ANDY'S DEN,
	AND DIRECTLY TOWARD WHERE WE LAST SAW HELEN.

	SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE!  SHE IS
	WRESTLING HERSELF UP OVER THE WALL TOWARD CAMERA, INTO
	ANOTHER ROOM OUT OF HIS PATH.  WE PAN WITH HER AS SHE WIGGLES
	HERSELF OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO
	FURNITURE, MAKING A HUGE NOISE.

	MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION.  HE DECIDES.  LEAPS
	WITH CATLIKE GRACE ONTO A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND FROM THERE
	ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!

	NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE
	GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH
	ANGLE POV.

	HELEN:  SHE CROUCHES IN HIDING.  IN DEEP FOCUS, BEYOND HER,
	AND HIGH ABOVE HER, WE SEE THE MAN SILHOUETTED AS HE BEGINS
	TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON
	BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.

	HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.
	INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN.  HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED
	COVERS.

	THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.

	SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE
	ADJACENT ROOM.  THE MAN'S FIGURE DOESN'T EVEN SLOW, HE'S
	ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT:  HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING
	ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.

	SHE HITS THE REMOTE:  THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT
	COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

	CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH
	ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE

	RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the
	building.

	BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a
	time.

	HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND
	TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S
	FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY
	BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

	LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE
	BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with
	a knife-scarred face.

				MAN
		I can explain!

				RUBEN
		The fuck you can!
			(shouts)
		Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

	Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

				RUBEN
		Did this animal touch you?

	She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
	RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

				RUBEN
		Turn on a light and call in the
		unit.  NOW!

	BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

				MAN
		No gun!

				RUBEN
		Bullshit's gonna get your balls
		stomped on!  What's your name?

				MAN
		Chow.  Conrad Chow.

	The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry
	kick to the man's side.

				MAN
		Swear to God!  Conrad Chow.  Never
		carry a gun.

				BURT
		Backup's here...

				RUBEN
			(to Burt)
		Then you get your ass outta here, I
		don't wanta see you again...

				CONRAD
		I brought a present for the lady,
		there.  I'm looking for her, to give
		her the present...

				RUBEN
		You break into her apartment to
		deliver a gift?  Where is it?

				CONRAD
		The door was open, swear to God,
		I'm just looking for her when you
		come charging up the stairs...

				RUBEN
		Where is it?

				CONRAD
		I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the
		lady's pillow...

	Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow... 
	scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns
	to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the
	book up like a question.

				CONRAD
		Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
		book, he wanted the lady to have
		it.  They won't let him send it to
		her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
		to deliver it in person, he says,
		put it on her pillow.  It has all
		about how he tried to kill her.

				RUBEN
		He told you she was loaded, any-
		thing you could steal you could
		keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself
		a return ticket to Quentin,
		breaking and entering.

				CONRAD
		The door was already open...

				RUBEN
		We know...
			(to a cop)
		Send the book to evidence...

				CONRAD
		She's supposed to have it.

				RUBEN
		She don't want it.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
	chest.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's
		nothing.  A burglar.

	She sits there, says nothing.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Open the door.  Please.

				HELEN
		Why don't you shoot off the lock?

	She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
	she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
	her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
	washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

				HELEN
		He was in my apartment!

				RUBEN
		I know, baby.  I know.

	Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
	she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
	the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
	her.

				RUBEN
		It's okay... you're safe with me!

	He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
	around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
	her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

				RUBEN
		When I was a little kid, and I'd be
		in a state, my father would hold me
		on his lap, until all the fight
		would go out of me...

	She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

				HELEN
		You think you're my Daddy?

	There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
	RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
	she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
	smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
	Been agreed upon.

				RUBEN
		Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

	He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

				RUBEN
		You know how to use this?

				HELEN
		They taught me at the FBI.  I was
		very good at it.  It scared me... I
		liked it.

				RUBEN
		You take it, hang on to it, it'll
		make you feel safer.  Stay put.

				HELEN
		What else?

	He goes.

	A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY
	NUMBERS" BY THE POLICE...

		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art..."

	HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE
	IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
	HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

	THE SONG CONTINUES...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical
	cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
	doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
	identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
	in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
	couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

	INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

	As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
	the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
	a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
	continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
	the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
	pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
	cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
	belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
	stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

	QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
	gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
	a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

	M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
	addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more
	FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.
	THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A
	projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
	phone booth.

		Dr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art.
		Well, if you have a taste for this experience
		You're flushed with your very first success
		Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
		Before your conscience bothers you much less.
		Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
		In history's great dark hall of fame
		All of our greatest killers were industrious
		At least the ones that we all know by name."

	SAKS speaks...

				SAKS
		Hello.  I am (research title)
		Meryhew Saks.  The song is called
		"Murder By Numbers."  The
		performers are a group called The
		Police.  Adam here...
                ... from Behavioral Science is
		working out exactly what this
		perpetrator is trying to telegraph
		in the note.  This is an extremely
		complex case, and we have a lot of
		fancy theories floating around.
		We're not ruling out the possib-
		ility of three Copycat serial
		killers.  We have Quantico working
		on graphology, the Washington lap
		is cloning DNA from the secretor.
		It's our feeling that the best lead
		we have is the two sperm samples in
		one of the victims.  We have a team
		sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want
		to say a few word to you local
		people.  Your Commissioner asked
		for our assistance.  The Bureau
		does not send us in on these cases
		to lord it over the local police.
		We couldn't catch up on what you
		people know if we had a year.  We
		have nation-wide resources and hard
		state of the art forensic science;
		you have the local savvy.  Together
		we can be unbeatable.  Which one is
		Inspector Halloran?

				M.J.
		Over here.

	SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
	TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

				SAKS
		We don't see too many lady homicide
		detectives.  You have my respect.
		Have you discussed the note with
		Dr. Hudson?

				M.J.
		Someone broke into her place last
		night.  It wasn't connected to our
		case, but it shook her up pretty
		bad so I haven't...

	QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

				SAKS
		I was just about to advise the
		Inspector here not to show Dr.
		Hudson the note.

				M.J.
		Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
		pattern develop...

				SAKS
			(riding over her)
		We know Helen.  She's not exactly a
		credible collaborator.  Especially
		late in the day...

				M.J.
		She takes tranquilizers her doctor
		prescribes.

				SAKS
		Who prescribes the brandy?

	M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

				M.J.
		How come you're so up on Dr.
		Hudson?

				SAKS
		She is a writer, writing best
		selling books about serial killing.
		Giving lectures she's well-paid
		for.  Her interests are not the
		interests of law enforcement.

				M.J.
		Okay.

				SAKS
		We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
		phone.  I know you won't mention
		it.

	So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has
	arrived, addresses SAKS.

				QUINN
		Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word
		with my officer...

	He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

				QUINN
		M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
		Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing
		in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
		night and Jack's kid got hit by a
		car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

				M.J.
		What does this mean?  Now we got
		the FBI, my team is expendable?
		I'm working my ass off, is anybody
		listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He
		and Nikko don't even get on
		together...

				QUINN
		Teach both of them a lesson in
		cooperation and self-discipline.

				M.J.
		If this is a first step in kicking
		me off the case, just tell me, to
		my face, sir, don't waste time
		being diplomatic.

				QUINN
		Just, I need results.  And -- I am
		short-handed.  Who else am I gonna
		give him?

				M.J.
			(looking at Saks)
		Give him thatpompous son of a
		bitch.

	She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi
	meets her...

				GIGI
		Lab called.  They got a result on
		the drug test you requested...?

	It takes a moment to remember what it was...

				GIGI
		They said it was Windex?

	If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's
	gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited
	dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that
	M.J. has just given her.

				HELEN
		..."I'll be back..."

	As she looks at the back of the note... she looks up into
	M.J.'S face.

				M.J.
		Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't
		lose your head."

	Helen puts down the note.  She is holding herself together
	by main will power... doesn't want to face that note...

				HELEN
		They put  Merry Saks on it?!

				M.J.
		He said to send you his regards and 
		to tell you that the Bureau holds
		you in the highest esteem.

				HELEN
		What I can't believe is that in an
		earlier life I slept with him!
		Christ!  Any God that loved his
		people would give women a rewind on
		their life and an erase button.
			(looks at M.J.)
		Just give me a minute here.  The
		letter is addressed to me...
			(she's breathing
			 fast, controls it)
		You don't feel fear, do you?
		You're young.  You feel like you'll
		live forever.  How wonderful.

				M.J.
		I put my ass on the line, giving
		you that.

				HELEN
		They weren't going to show it to
		me?!  The arrogance!  It's my life!

				M.J.
		It's also the major piece of
		evidence, and it makes you a key
		part of his plan.  You can't run
		away from it anymore.
			(beat)
		Look at the order he's doing
	them... He did three as the Boston
		Strangler just to tell us a copycat
		serial killer was at work.  Then he
		did one like the Hillside Strang-
		ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.
		To lead us on -- to where and what
		end?  And he's doing more than that
		-- he's imitating each killer's
		method as closely as he can -- in
		details.  Injecting Windex.  Using
		.44.  Playing Abba.

				HELEN
		It's not chronological: Son of Sam
		was before Hillside.

	She begins to read.

				M.J.
		It's clear he thinks he knows me.
		He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't
		lose your head.'  Is that a threat?
		Does he want to cut off my head?
		Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?
		Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I
		think Rivkind did.

	She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out.  She
	closes her eyes for a moment.  We begin to see certain
	filtered images.  As they come, we INTERCUT them.

				HELEN
		He attacks what he feels he can't
		have.  What he feels excluded
		from...

	EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

	Lush, pastoral green.  We see PETER sitting by himself.  He
	wears a WHITE LAB COAT, like one we saw hanging in his
	basement.

	HIS POV:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
	studying together, picnicking.  Women sunbathe, their straps
	pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to
	expose their midriffs.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		'First you make a stone of your
		heart.'... Oh yes!  He doesn't
		suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our
		turn.

	One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then
	takes her top off entirely.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Kemper said in order to have the
		experience he wanted with them, he
		needed to evict them from their
		bodies.  By making the body a
		completely passive object, he
		releases himself from passivity.

	CLOSE:  HELEN, DEEP IN THOUGHT...

				HELEN
		But the relief he feels is only
		temporary.  '...Before your
		conscience bothers you much
		less...'  But the tension always
		comes back.
			(she now picks out
			 the words:)
		'You can join the ranks of the
		illustrious...'  He wants to be
		like them.  The best.  To become
		the best.  But, he has his own
		desires, his own compulsions apart
		from theirs.'  His own horrors...

	FLASHBACK: PETER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

	An incremental flash of a SMALL BOY standing by his bed
	which he has wet.  His pajamas are soaked.  His powerful
	MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Some horrors that are all his
		own...

	The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where
	firewood and stacked papers are kept.  The door is slammed
	hard.  He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of
	matches, lights one.  Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile
	of newspapers.  They start to burn.  We see, but do not,
	hear, his screams for help.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		He needs to prove they don't
		control him, that he's the one in
		control.  But the feeling of power
		never lasts.  He can control his
		victims, but he can't control
		anything else... his place in the
		world.  He want s to be recognized.
		He puts messages in my computer; he
		sends me a letter...

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	She picks out the lines... "then you must try a twosome or a
	threesome."

				HELEN
		Of course he wants to do a
		threesome!  Only Bundy did three in
		one day.  Is Bundy next?  But Bundy
		should be last... the grand finale.
		What about Kemper and Ramirez?
		Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?  Rivkind?
		Who else is on his list?  In what
		order?

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	PETER in his car.  Ahead, he see TWO GIRLS at a bus stop.
	We see PETER take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal
	it under his right thigh.  The TWO GIRLS are wearing
	backpacks.  'FESTIVAL OF LOVE' stickers decorate the bags.
	PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says
	something.  They giggle, shake their heads.  He laughs,
	holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a 'Not
	guilty!' gesture, then makes a peace sign.  The girls giggle
	again, but do not get in.

	PETER drives off.

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

				HELEN
		Hello, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		You read my book which as you know,
		hit the stands a couple of weeks
		ago.  You read it yet.

				HELEN
		What book?

				DARYLL
			(indignant)
		I sent it by private courier, he

	Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

				HELEN
		I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		Bet you never figured I'd follow in
		your footsteps.  It's real well-
		written.  You should read it --
		you're in it.

				HELEN
		I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and
		talk to you about it after I've
		read it.  Right now I have a
		question... Peter Kurten.

				DARYLL
		Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I
		told that son I'd send him what he
		wanted if he leave you alone.

				HELEN
		Ah ha.  What did he want?

				DARYLL
		Something personal.  Is he bothering
		you?

				HELEN
		I don't know.  I'd like to know
		where he is.

				DARYLL
		Listen, you want my advice?  Steer
		clear.  He's writing me he's gonna
		finish 'my unfinished symphony.'
		He's gonna give me $550 for some of
		my cum, he says he's in a position
		to see that I will be immortal if
		he has some of my spunk.  I'm
		offended.  Right away I smell
		freak.  Writin' about him and me
		and you bein' joined and he's gonna
		finish my symphony?  I didn't care
		for his drift.  I sent some liquid
		soap in a sandwich baggie with a
		message from Jesus to mend his
		ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And
		what's funny is, now I don't mind
		bein' inside.  If I was out, even
		Born Again, I'd probably get
		restless again.  It's maybe better
		I stay here, what do you think?

				HELEN
		I think whatever is best for you,
		Daryll.  And maybe you're right,
		that's the place.

				DARYLL
		You come and visit.

				HELEN
		Where did you send the message to
		Peter Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!
		That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to
		Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in
		return for getting my book to you.

	At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

				DARYLL
		Conrad has the phone number.
		Conrad, where is he?

			(from M.J.'s pantomime)
		In jail.

		That Klutz.  They send him back

				DARYLL LEE
		Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come
		see me, talk to me.  I think about
		you, worry about you all the time.
		I am so glad Jesus didn't let me
		kill you.  You know -- you're
		blessed by Jesus.  That's why you
		need to come talk to me, because
		Jesus kept you alive for a reason,
		and I was his sacred instrument...
		In the moment Satan was in my heart
		raising my hand to kill you, Jesus
		took my hand to spare you.  I am

	PANDEMONIUM AMONG THE DETAINEES.  COPS RUSH TO CONTROL THE
	PROBLEM.

				NIKKO
		Outta your mind?  Look at this...

				M.J.
			(to Quinn)
		Lieutenant...?

	Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally
	bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild
	kid.

	NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the
	drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the
	kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

				M.J.
		The prowler in Hudson's apartment
		turns out to have a meeting with a
		suspect...

				QUINN
			(amazed)
		You got a suspect...

	THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.

				QUINN
		How'd you get in on the deal?

				M.J.
		I'm gonna drop charges on the
		break-and-enter at Hudson's...

				QUINN
		You have no authority to make a
		deal like that.  That' s for the
		D.A...

				M.J.
		Or the F.B.I.?

				QUINN
		Saks.  If he knew you did that!
		They're all asking me, 'what is she
		doing,' as it is.

				M.J.
		Give me Ruben back...

				QUINN
		Nikko?

				NIKKO
		We get through this shit, let 'em
		all go.

	NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the
	door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP
	US HERE:  8:47)

				M.J.
		I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll
		be in the jail when you wind this
		up...

				RUBEN
		I gotta get something to eat, I
		haven't eaten all day.

	M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and
	commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair
	and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
	Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
	teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

	RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
	KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
	the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
	can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where
	he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,
	MAC rises.

				MAC
		Here... I'm finished...

				RUBEN
			(to Kid)
		I'm going to the coffee machine.
		Hold the fort.

	He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the
	room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get
	free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

	CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer
	behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the
	KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed
	against the desk.

		I don't have it...

	M.J. starts to open the door...

				CONRAD
		Wait... wait... I already called

				M.J.
		You already made the delivery?

				CONRAD
		No, that's still in my jacket I was

	STEPS INTO THE DEEP SHADOWS AND SEEMS TO VANISH.

				RUBEN
		Behave.  You refuse my hospitality,
		I'm putting you to bed.

	He pushes the coffee toward the Kid, who WHIPS NIKKO'S GUN
	OUT FROM UNDER THE DESK, where it was hidden, and lays it up
	under Ruben's ear.  KID moves behind RUBEN and puts a skinny
	arm around RUBEN'S neck, pulling him upright.  RUBEN still
	clutching the doughnut box.  It takes a moment for the
	others to SEE.  Then the room is absolutely motionless.

				NIKKO
		Take it easy, Kid.  Nobody's gonna

		Nobody comes through the door...

	Behind the KID, as he backs through the door, across the

	COMING ALMOST AT A RUN -- SHE SEES what is happening.

	The KID doesn't see her, yet, as he is backing away from the
	others... M.J. DRAWS HER GUN AND STANDS IN FIRING POSITION.

	IF SHE FIRES FROM HERE RUBEN IS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE KID, AND
	OTHER OFFICERS, IN THE LINE THE BULLET WOULD TAKE ARE STILL
	SCRAMBLING OUT OF HER LINE... SHE CAN'T FIRE.

				M.J.
		Hey, you...

	The KID turns, sees her, exposing his shoulder to her... SHE
	FIRES AND HITS THE KID.

	HE IS THROWN TO THE FLOOR AND TWISTED AROUND BY THE IMPACT,
	LANDING BEHIND RUBEN SO SHE CAN'T MAKE A SECOND SHOT.

	RUBEN GOES FOR HIS OWN GUN, BUT THE KID'S GUN THAT FELL FROM
	HIS HAND IS RIGHT BY HIM STILL.  THE KID GRABS IT AND FIRES
	BEFORE RUBEN HAS HIS GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF HIS HOLSTER.  THE
	KID SHOOTS RUBEN IN THE THROAT AT AN ANGLE THAT TAKES THE
	BULLET STRAIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN.

	THEN THE KID THROWS THE GUN AWAY, AND STANDS, HIS HANDS UP
	IN SURRENDER, A GRIN ON HIS FACE.  THIS ENTIRE ACTION HAS
	TAKEN ABOUT SIX SECONDS.  THE KID GOES DOWN, FLATTENED BY

				QUINN
		I called our SWAT Commander...

		He's ours now... You come watch
		our boys in action...

	And walks away...

				SAKS
			(under his breath)
		Well, thank you, too.

	EXT. OLD FRAME HOUSE, DALY CITY - NIGHT

	SWAT TEAM SURROUNDING THE HOUSE, WITH GREAT QUIET AND EFFORT
	TO CONCEAL THE OPERATION.  QUINN in command over a SWAT
	COMMANDER -- JENSEN.  There are ambulances, a fire truck,
	search lights.  SWAT TEAM, AND FBI all wear bulky flack
	jackets, with yellow ID stencilled on the back.  Quinn sees
	M.J., huddled in her old oversize jacket, gestures M.J.
	should have a flack jacket like theirs.  She taps her chest,
	where she has a bullet-proof vest under her shirt.

	THE HOUSE:  VARIOUS SHOTS, SILHOUETTED FIGURES MOVING TO
	VANTAGE POINTS FOR THE ASSAULT.

	ON A VIEW INCLUDING A CELLAR WINDOW: LIGHT INSIDE.  AS
	CROUCHED SWAT MAN RUNS BY WE SEE: PETER INSIDE, PASSING BY,
	GLANCE OUT...

	INT. PETER'S BASEMENT

	PETER HESITATES, LOOKING OUT.  HE FLICKS OFF LIGHTS.  MOVES
	PURPOSEFULLY OUT OF FRAME... WE HEAR A MOAN (O.S.).

	A HAND GASPS THE HANDLE OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A GUN; AS IT IS
	BROUGHT UP INTO A WIDER VIEW IT HAS A LONG BARREL WHICH
	SUDDENLY SHOOTS FLAME: A PROPANE BARBECUE LIGHTER...

	EXT. HOUSE

	THEY ARE ALMOST READY FOR THE FIRST MOVE; THREE SWAT MEN BY
	THE DOOR.  ANOTHER TWO PREPARING TO MOVE FORWARD AND
	ANNOUNCE THEMSELVES.

				SWAT COMM
			(on bullhorn)
		Peter Foley, we are the police.
		Will you please come to your front
		door, and come out with your hands
		above your head...(etc.)

	INSIDE A SMOKE ALARM BEGINS TO GO.  LIGHT FLICKERS IN CELLAR
	WINDOWS.

	SWAT MEN AT THE DOOR: THEY SMASH THE LOCK AND CHARGE IN.  M.J.
	AND OTHER DETECTIVES WITH THEM.

	INT. HOUSE

	A dozen men pour into the house from front and back,
	converging in the dimly lit living room.  SMOKE OBSCURES
	EVERYTHING.  The dining room and kitchen are empty.  M.J.
	FOLLOWS CONTINGENT THAT RACES UPSTAIRS.  OTHERS FAN OUT
	THROUGH THE WHOLE STRUCTURE.  FIREMEN COME BEHIND LOOKING
	FOR THE FIRE.

	INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	SMOKE IS THINNER HERE.  The room lighted only by the
	glowing TV screen.  The WIFE still in bed, shot through the
	head.  Others crowd in, kicking in closet and bathroom
	doors.  M.J. IS BY THE  BED JUST TURNING TO START ABACK
	DOWNSTAIRS LOOKING FOR PETER.

	SWAT MAN emerges from the bathroom with the body of NASTY
	LITTLE DOG, holding it by the tail:

	THEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S WARNING SIRES SHRIEK:  THEY MEAN
	EVERYBODY OUT... FIREMEN CHARGE FOR EXITS...

	AS THEY CHARGE THROUGH DOWNSTAIRS...

	M.J. CAN SEE TWO FIREMEN AT THE BASEMENT DOOR.  SMOKE BILLOWS
	FROM UNDER IT.  BEHIND IT WE HEAR SCREAMING.  THE FIREMEN
	SMASH THE DOOR, DROPPING TO THE FLOOR AS THEY DO...

	M.J'S POV: BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS OUT ACROSS THE CEILING
	THEN EXPLODES INTO WHITE HOT FLAME.  SHE HAS STEPPED FORWARD
	SO SHE CAN SEE OVER THE FIREMEN DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT: IN
	THE SUDDEN FLARE SHE SEES A MAN, WITH TIN-RIMMED GLASSES AND
	BLACK LEATHER CLOTHING ENTIRELY ENGULFED IN FLAME RUNNING UP
	THE BASEMENT STAIRS; BEHIND HIM THE BASEMENT IS BURNING.

	INT. BASEMENT

	LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP STAIRS: FLAME ALL AROUND -- PETER'S 
	PHOTO COLLAGES ON THE BULLETIN BOARD BURNING.  THE MAN 
	RUNNING UP THE STAIRS ALMOST MAKES IT TO THE TOP BEFORE
	HE FALLS BACK DOWN INTO THE CAMERA.  AT THE TOP, WE SEE M.J.
	AND THE FIREMEN'S APPALLED FACES.  THE SCREAMING DIES OFF...

	EXT. HOUSE

	FLAME NOW ENGULFING THE BASEMENT AND GROUND FLOOR: FIREMEN
	AND M.J. RACING OUT COUGHING AND CHOKING.

	THEN: A HUGE HOT FLOOM OF AN EXPLOSION: FLAMES THREATEN TO
	CONSUME THE ENTIRE HOUSE.  FIREMEN SWARM BACK TO KNOCK DOWN
	FLAME FROM OUTSIDE.

	M.J., QUINN, ETC., WATCHING THE EVIDENCE GO UP IN SMOKE.
	THEIR FACES LIGHTED BY THE FLAME.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	She has now changed into a pair of sweat pants and a
	T-shirt.  SUSAN SCHIFFER IS ON TV: WITH SHOTS OF THE FIRE
	BEING SNUFFED OUT.

				SUSAN
		I am here with Lieutenant Quinn of
		the Homicide Division and (title)
		Saks of the FBI.  Can you tell us
		what happened here, tonight?

	During the following we move to PETER'S HOUSE where Quinn
	and Saks are being interviewed.

				QUINN
		Susan, the San Francisco Police
		Department, assisted by the FBI,
		developed evidence that the serial
		killer, referred to as the Copycat
		killer was an individual who
		resided at this address.  Upon
		being asked to step out of the
		house to be interviewed, the
		suspect set fire to the house
		possibly to destroy evidence of his
		wife's murder.  We found her dead
		of gunshot wounds in an upstairs
		bedroom.  He himself died in the
		fire.
			(to shouted
			 questions)
		No, we'll wait until we've located
		any relatives who should be
		notified.  Witnesses saw the
		individual burn to death, they were
		unable to reach him in time to save
		him.  We're glad, as the entire
		city must be glad, this reign of
		terror is ended.  No, no more at
		this time.  Thank you...

	END OF HELEN STARING STONILY AT THE SCREEN:  SHE DOESN'T
	BELIEVE IT FOR A MOMENT.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

	M.J., wearily enters.  Others quietly entering, slipping out
	coats, talking and drinking at some distance.  M.J. takes
	off her shoulder holster and gun and puts them down on her
	workspace.  NIKKO is at little distance cleaning out his
	desk.  He comes down to her as she sits...

				NIKKO (V.O.)
		I heard. Good police work.

				M.J.
		Just horseshit luck.

				NIKKO
		Don't ever forget how good you are.

	He is standing behind her and leans over to almost touch her
	hair with his lips...

				NIKKO
		I love you.

	He goes.  M.J. twists in misery and fury... Her phone is
	ringing on another line; she punches it...

				NJ
		Halloran.

				HELEN
		I don't believe it.

				M.J.
		Helen.
			(beat)
		I saw him die.  I saw him burning on
		the basement stairs, he never
		reached the top.

				HELEN
		They never kill themselves.  How do
		you know it was him.  You never met
		him.  You never even saw a
		photograph...

				M.J.
		Helen -- let go.  You've got to let
		go.

				HELEN
		He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done
		every one of the others, hasn't he?
		If there are three dead Chi Omega
		college girls tomorrow, how will
		you feel?  Go there.  See if there
		could be any way for him to escape.

				M.J.
		This has been the worst 48 hours of
		my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going
		to try to get drunk.

				HELEN
		If there's a one percent possibil-
		ity, can you live with yourself
		when he kills again?

				M.J.
		Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn
		self righteous.

							CUT TO:

	INT. M.J'S CAR - NIGHT

	M.J. is now almost dead with fatigue.  She barely misses
	hitting another car.  She drives on until she is forced to
	stop at a traffic light.  All during this:

				RADIO NEWS
		...You're on the air, who's
		this...Ron, that's not my right
		name... that's okay, Ron. What are
		you afraid of?... I don't want
		anybody to know my name, because
		I'm a friend of Peter Foley?  I 
		know him from the gay community?  He
		was cruising the night...

	M.J. switches stations, channel surfing... bits of music,
	Rush Limbaugh, back to Ron droning on.

				RADIO NEWS
		...that I resent the tone of the
		Police and their attitude?  That
		this is just some weird queer
		event, just because they couldn't
		stop this guy until he did himself,
		if you even believe that...

	M.J. turns off the radio... when light turns green,
	instead of moving ahead, she just sits for a moment.  Then,
	furious with HELEN, with everything, she swears and wheels
	the car into a tight illegal u-turn.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. NIGHT BERKELEY CAMPUS - NIGHT

	It is extra time, which means party time or those who've
	finished and solitary and group study time for the rest.
	And there are celebrants of the Festival of Love, who were
	being born about the time of the original event.  TRACKING
	SHOT TO ESTABLISH THIS SCENE, MOVING, SEARCHING ALONG THE
	AVENUES, PASSING KNOTS OF STUDENTS AND PARTY-GOES... WE
	HAVE SEEN A PEACEFUL CAMPUS, QUIETLY CELEBRATING.  AND WE
	HAVE DRAWN UP BEFORE CHI OMEGA.  THERE IS NO PLACE TO PARK.
	M.J., WHOSE POV THIS HAS BEEN LOOKS AT HER WATCH.
	DECIDES: FUCK IT, THIS IS CRAZY AND IS ABOUT TO DRIVE AWAY,
	SHIFTING INTO GEAR WHEN SHE SPOTS:

	POV.  A GOLD COLORED VW BUG

	It is parked under a tree some distance across a parking lot
	jammed with student cars.  It is partly in shadow, so she
	could easily have missed it.  She jumps out of the car and
	moves fast up the steps through students, drinking, kissing,
	studying, arguing...

	INT. CHI OMEGA - NIGHT

	MAIN MEETING ROOM.  Full of people milling about.  Music is
	playing.  SEES THE BACK OF A TALL MAN ON CRUTCHES TALKING TO
	A COED.  HE HAS A LOAD OF BOOKS SHE TAKES FROM HIM; SHE IS
	LAUGHING.  M.J. moving fast toward them, she runs into a
	girl, spilling the girls' drink on her blouse...

				GIRL
		Goddamn it!  This is brand new!
		Where're you going?

	As M.J. continues to move the Girl grabs her...

				GIRL
		No, you don't spill all over
		somebody and just walk away, you
		damn well pay the cleaning bill...

				M.J.
		Police business -- take your heads
		off.

				GIRL
		Bullshit!

	M.J. holds up the badge...

				M.J.
		Don't make me pull the gun...

	She jerks away, almost knocking the Girl down.  The Girl is
	yelling, beginning to attract attention.  As M.J. turns back
	to SEE.

	PETER AND THE COED are just moving off, the Coed holding his
	books, he hobbling on the crutches.  M.J. runs through the
	crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is
	getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from
	sight behind a wall, PETER looks around, straight at M.J..

	IT ISN'T PETER AT ALL.

	M.J. LOOKING AROUND, MOVES TO STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR...

	M.J. EMERGING FROM STAIRS INTO THE CORRIDOR -- SHE RUNS DOWN
	THIS CORRIDOR OF ROOMS, PUSHING OPEN ANY THAT ARE SHUT.

	A SCARED COUPLE MAKING LOVE CONFRONT HER GUN.  SHE
	REHOLSTERS IT AND RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY...

	OVER THE PARTY NOISE AND MUSIC WE HEAR A SCREAM.  M.J. RACES
	DOWN CORRIDORS, TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE.  ANOTHER SCREAM.
	IT SEEMS TO COME FROM BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.  M.J. KICKS IT
	OPEN, BURSTING IN:

	INT. ROOM

	A BUNCH OF STONED STUDENTS PASSING A JOINT: ON A TV PLAYER
	IS THE IMAGE OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN AN EARLY SHOCKER: THEY
	ARE PLAYING AT WHO CAN OUT-SCREAM JAMIE LEE CURTIS.

	WHEN JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAMS --

	THEY ALL SCREAM BACK!  AND BURST INTO HOWLS OF LAUGHTER.  THE
	SIGHT OF M.J. WITH HER GUN OUT ONLY MAKES THEM HOWL LOUDER.

				STUDENT
		Swallow the joint!  It's Barney
		Phyfe -- in drag!

	THEN ALTOGETHER THEY SCREAM AT HER!  AND HOWL WITH LAUGHTER.

	THE HALL. 

	M.J. walks out of the room and down the corridor.

	EXT. CHI OMEGA FRONT STEPS

	SHE LOOKS OUT ACROSS THE PARKING LOT: THE GOLD VW BUG IS 
	GONE.

	SHE WALKS TO HER CAR, RELIEVED.  THE WHOLE THING SEEMS LIKE
	A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH SHE HAS NOW AWAKENED.

	INT. M.J'S CAR

	AS SHE OPENS THE DOOR, REACHES IN AND GRABS HER PHONE.  SHE
	ACTIVATES PHONE, WHEN SHE IS BLINDSIDED BY PETER WHO SLAMS
	HER INTO THE CAR, FACE DOWN ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT.  HE 
	DISARMS HER, TWISTS HER INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT...

	THERE ARE STUDENTS AT SOME DISTANCE, BUT SHE CAN'T MAKE
	HERSELF BE HEARD.  SHE IS GROGGY FROM THE BLOW SHE'S TAKEN.
	HE HANDCUFFS HER TO THE CAR, FIND HER KEYS, AND BEGINS TO
	DRIVE AWAY... PETER'S HAIR IS NOW BRIGHT RED -- LIKE DARYLL
	LEE CULLUM'S.

								CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen lies wide awake in the dark.  PHONE RINGS.

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

	INSERT: TAPE RECORDER ATTACHED TO PHONE.  IT STARTS TO TURN.
	AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM AN FBI DETECTIVE IS POURING HIMSELF
	SOME COFFEE.  HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WE HEAR:

				HELEN (V.O.)
			(thinking it's M.J.)
		Where are you?

				PETER (V.O.)
		Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter
		Foley -- how do you grade me now,
		Doctor?

	HELEN ON PHONE

				HELEN
			(beat)
		Who was the man in the basement?

				PETER
		You like that action?  Didn't that
		cop on TV look solemn?  The guy in
		the basement doesn't matter,
		anyway, just another lonely heart.

				HELEN
		Where are you, Peter?

				PETER
		You thought I was going to do Ted
		Bundy next, so you sent your
		partner...

	Helen gasps with the implications of that...

				PETER
		What was that?  What am I hearing?
		The sound of an epiphany, a sudden
		blinding insight?

				HELEN
		It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?

				PETER
		Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You
		have to come to me.

				HELEN
		You know I can't do that.

				PETER
		Oh, I think you will.

	Peter rips duct tape off M.J.'s mouth...

				M.J.
			(yelling)
		Call the police!  Now!  Call Qui...

	Peter punches M.J. who is handculled in her car; they are
	parked in front of the Lecture Hall.

				HELEN
		For God's sake Peter, leave her out
		of it.  You don't want her, you
		want me.

				PETER
		I need her; she's a cop.  I have to
		kill a cop, and then...

				HELEN
		You've been perfect.  Don't spoil
		the symmetry -- you have to have a
		male cop.

				PETER
		I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's
		the important thing.  Cop-ness, not
		sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but
		it'll be good.

				M.J.
			(yells)
		Call Quinn and Saks.

				PETER
		I'm tired.  I want it to end
		tonight, don't you?

				HELEN
		Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now.
		Let her go.  I'll come -- just let
		her go.  She's not important.

				PETER
		You know where.

				HELEN
		Where it began -- McCluskey
		Auditorium.

	He hangs up.

	INSERT: TAPE MONITOR.  WE HEAR HELEN HANGING UP.  A SMALL

	BATHROOM DRAWER

	It is pulled open: metallic sounds of  bullets rolling on the
	wooden drawer: her hand bats away the usual bathroom drawer
	garbage and pull Ruben's gun out; HER TREMBLING FINGERS
	RELOAD IT.

	EXT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALL - NIGHT

	Helen wearing loose coat, jeans and sneakers opens the door.
	FRED snaps out of a sound sleep.

				HELEN
		It's all over, Fred.  They got the
		guy.  You go home to your own bed
		now.

				FRED
		I got to have that from my
		superior.  One guy fired off this
		job already.

				HELEN
		Call in.  Use my phone.  They'll
		tell you -- it's all over.

	FRED GOES.  HELEN STEPS RESOLUTELY INTO THE HALL, FOR
	REASSURANCE BRACES HERSELF WITH A HAND ON THE WALL.

	THE HALLWAY (HER POV).  IT SEEMS MILES LONG.  SOUND: HER
	FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO
	LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...

	HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR.  BRIDGES BURNED.  TURNS BACK.

	HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND
	PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL.  THEN HER HAND
	MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.

	HER POV.  THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL.  MOVING SHOT PICKS UP
	SPEED...

	HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.

	HELEN MOVES WITH MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE: HER AGORAPHOBIA
	IS GONE... HER HAND DROPS TO HER SIDE...

	EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT

	The door opens and Helen appears in it.  She confronts the
	street and the night... One more threshold to cross...

	STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND
	IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME.  The night seems to roar; the
	lights blur and flare.  A truck comes past too fast, 
	stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.

	HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

	INT. CAR as she slides into the driver's seat, slamming the
	door and locking it.  She drives off into the night.

	EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM -  NIGHT

	A broad view through shadowy trees shows it's lighted
	facade.  Parked in front of is M.J.'s car.  SUDDENLY FROM
	BEHIND THE TREES, SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT, BLOCKING THE WAY!

	REVERSE:  HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US.
	SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN
	FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET
	FLAGGING HER DOWN --

	SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE
	DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

				SAKS
		Ma'am, please get out of your
		vehicle...

				HELEN
		Merry, how... oh, Christ, of
		course, you had my phone tapped.

				SAKS
		Just get out of your vehicle...

				HELEN
		He's got Sergeant Halloran in
		there.  He'll kill her the minute
		he sees or hears your people...

				SAKS
		You've been very useful, Doctor, we
		appreciate all you've done, and now
		the professional will take over...

				HELEN
		He wants me, he doesn't care about
		her.  Let me...

	SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE
	DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE
	GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND
	FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS
	TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

	SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
	AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
	HIM FROM SHOOTING.

	NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
	street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
	brakes behind M.J.'s car.

	CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
	She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
	make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
	the wide stairs...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,
	listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
	windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
	without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
	returns...

	Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
	She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
	building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
	Peter somewhere in the room?

	She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
	auditorium...

	CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

	THEN:

	PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE
	VISION SNAPS.

	HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
	A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
	CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
	THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE
	WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
	SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
	DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE
	SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.

	REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
	BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE
	FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
	HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,
	BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
	TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
	AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO
	HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
	COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.

	HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!

	CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT
	ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
	THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

	AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,
	BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT
	DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE
	BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.
	IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT
	ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.

	SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

	EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT

	THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.

				SWAT
		Oh, man?!  Let us in there.

				SAKS
		Go.  Go.  Go!

	Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
	toward the Auditorium...

	INT. LADIES' ROOM

	HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE
	SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:

	M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
	IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE
	FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

	HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
	OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
	REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.

				PETER
		You cheated!  You said you'd come
		die with me.

	WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
	HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
	HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
	OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
	WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

	EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
	AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;
	THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING
	THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

	PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
	SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE
	TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
	TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP
	AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.

				PETER
		Listen to them!  We'll be on all
		three channels.

				HELEN
		Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

				PETER
		No.  Not yet.

				HELEN
		Do it.  If that's what all this
		carnage is about, then do it.  Have
		enough guts to do it.

				PETER
		Don't talk to me about courage.  I
		know death, what it's like to kill.
		You're not a killer -- you watched
		Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
		didn't make a peep, because you
		were paralyzed with fear.  You
		chocked.  I know something else about
		you.

	Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
	pill into his mouth and swallows...

				PETER
		You want one?  No?  There was
		something in you that was
		fascinated, that wanted to see what
	it was like for a man to die.
		Everybody feels it.  Like every
		person who slows to see a bad
		accident, or runs to see a fire.
		That's true.  I see it in you...
		you're the same as me.

	THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.

				PETER
		Oh, no.

	HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS
	HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.

	FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,
	INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
	DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

	He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair
	facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

				PETER
		We'll keep talking.  Until they get
		here.  Then...
			(smiles)

				HELEN
		I have no life anymore.  I ruined
		your life, make me pay for it.

				PETER
		Why did you do that?  Didn't you
		have any idea how hard it was for
		me, to get that far?  I worshipped
		you.  You inspired me.  I thought
		you could understand me the way you
		understood the others.  I knew that
		about you -- the ones you admired
		were the great murderers; they
		fascinated you.

				HELEN
		That's not who I admire -- I admire
		people who are good at what they
		do, great artists, writers,
		thinkers...

				PETER
		I don't have the talent for any of
		those things.  All I have a talent
		for is death.  And I am one of a
		kind.  What do you think of your
		student now?  I have made you
		famous, I am your creation and your
		monument.

	BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
	VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES
	BUT PETER DOES NOT.

				HELEN
		If you let me, I can make you more
		famous than any of them.

				PETER
		Oh, please.  I know what's coming,
		now.  "Let me help you..."

				HELEN
		Do anything you want to me.  I give
		myself to you.  Only put the knife
		down.  Isn't this what you always
		wanted?  I know it's what we all
		want, to love and to loved.  I
		could love you.  You could work
		together in some safe place, learn
		to really understand you, help you,
		give you some peace of mind, some
		happiness...

				PETER
		Back in the driver's seat again,
		Doctor?  That old dream -- study us
		to see what makes us sick.  So you
		can find a cure -- they'd name it
		after you?  Death is the only cure
		for people like me.

	He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
	moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

	HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
	AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
	TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
	THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.

	HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM
	BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT
	HER...

	BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
	SHOT.

	HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS
	M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
	SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.

				HELEN
		Do it.  For God's sake, now...

	M.J. FIRES.

	PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,
	SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.

				PETER
			(surprised, like a
			 child)
		You hurt me!

	M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST
	GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:

	THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
	EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.

	THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED
	SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
	GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
	SHADOWS.

	OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...

				M.J. & HELEN
		No!!

	PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN
	SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...

	A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
	TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.

	SWAT TEAM

	LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.

	PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
	SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
	BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

				M.J.
		Jesus that hurts.  You think the
		rib is busted?

				PARAMEDIC
		That looks like just a bad bruise.
		I'll tape it up if you want to...

				M.J.
		I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
		instead, how about a lot of number
		six?

	The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around
	them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on
	her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

				M.J.
			(it hurts)
		Oh, God.

	SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
	LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
	and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she
	misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
	resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of
	officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
	AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.

				QUINN
		I'll take it, kid.  You take two
		weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a
		second thinking about that shitbag.
		Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

	He nods to Helen...

				QUINN (cont'd)
		Get the civilians outta here.

				M.J.
		She's in no shape to give her
		statement tonight...

				QUINN
		No, she can come in tomorrow...
		gonna want to know a lot of
		things...

	B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
	HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
	and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past
	them, as...

				HELEN
		The only one who could tell you
		what you really need to know is
		dead.

				QUINN
		Yeah, it's a thought...

	Of no importance to him, he turns away...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
	exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
	grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
	under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and
	HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...

	THE AUDITORIUM (POV).

	The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
	small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

	EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the
	corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
	CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
	M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
	SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
	AWAY...

				M.J.
		You could use a long hot bath, you
		know that?  You better get somebody
		to drive you home.

				HELEN
		Why can't I drive home?  I will.
		You.  Look at you.  You need a ride
		home.  And you don't even know it.

				M.J.
			(beat)
		Well, thanks.

	The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
	the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
	SHOT.

	THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

				SUSAN
		Hey!  Halloran!  What's the story
		here?

	On the two women getting in the car...

				HELEN
		If she has to ask, she's never
		gonna know.

	HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE
	NIGHT.

				THE END
INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

	The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
	speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
	a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
	FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
	TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
	pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
	distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
	assured.

				HELEN
		Our society creates these socially
		and psychically disenfranchised
		men, and their revenge on society
		is terrible.  They are hard to
		catch.  They are "the nice guy next
		door," their employers -- if they
		work at all -- find them quiet and
		uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
		rejection have taught them
		passivity.  Only in their violent
		fantasies do they feel alive.  What
		they seek in their frenzied
		assaults on their victims is relief
		from passivity.  For these men, ten
		minutes relief is worth far more
		than the life of another human
		being.  Torture, the pain they
		inflict, the screams of the victim,
		are all part of the ritual that
		gives them a brief respite from
		their own psychic pain.  And then
		the depression, the forgetting, the
		feeling of sadness and despair
		begins the cycle all over again.
		Like addicts seeking their drug,
		Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
		Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
		seek out their next victim.

	During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
	has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
	balcony railing.

	CLOSEUP: HELEN

				HELEN
		The cycle is endless until they are
		caught.  And they are caught by
		chance -- they run a red light, and
		a body is in the trunk.  A leaking	
		pipe brings a plumber to a basement
		where they is the smell of death.

	Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
	the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

	HELEN'S POV:

	Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
	MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
	arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

	HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

	Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
	alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
	exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
	wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
	attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

	Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
	there.

	HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

				HELEN
		At any time, right now, as you
		listen, the FBI estimates there are
		30 to 35 serial killers stalking
		their victims.  The serial killer is
		a plaque that must be addressed not
		only by the law, but by science.
		Florida spent eight million dollars
		to execute Ted Bundy.  It would
		have been better spent building a
		forensic penal facility devoted to
		research.

	Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
	that the smiling man is not there...

				HELEN
		Confined for life, without parole,
		and subjected to scientific study,
		these men's lives might finally, in
		some small measure, educate and
		thereby protect society.  Thank
		you.

	Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
	carefully casing the crowd.

								CUT TO:

	LATER:

	The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
	ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
	as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
	THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
	DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

								CUT TO:

	INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

	THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
	around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
	hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
	Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
	stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
	high heels to a stall several doors down.

	CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:

	And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
	ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
	view as

	HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
	around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
	makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
	just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
	DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.

	Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
	yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

	CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
	the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
	reacts...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

	The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
	hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

				COP (o.s.)
		Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
		there?

	The MAN lets slip a little slack.

	HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
	get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
	scream.

	CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
	sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
	a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
	there is more SOUND from inside...

	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
	we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
	her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
	toilet seat.

	COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
	see a broom closet door opening.

	HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
	second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
	his gun still in his hand.

	RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
	HELEN.

	COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
	in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
	the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

	STAGE AREA

	The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
	HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

								SLAM CUT:

	INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
	desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
	pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
	eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

				HELEN
		Andy!  Andy!

	She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
	FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
	hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

	INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

	The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
	is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

	HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
	HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
	where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
	The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
	herself with the sound of her own voice...

				HELEN
		It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
		city of San Francisco, California,
		U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
		most stable and happiest country in
		the world.  That is the sole place
		of life in the universe.  Under
		God.

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
	others scattering from the nervous haste...

	CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
	tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
	reflection with a certain detachment...

				HELEN
		Good God.  What happened to you?

	She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
	herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

								CUT TO:

	HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
	She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
	Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
	other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
	screen comes a command.

				CHESSMASTER
		'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
		move.'

	She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
	move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
	computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

				CHESSMASTER
		'Lousy move.  Not really into this
		game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
		got a feeling about you.  Let's
		meet.  Like a date.'

	HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

				HELEN
		'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
		life.'

				CHESSMASTER
		'Another romantic dream gone all to
		hell.'

				HELEN
		'Maybe it's better to just dream
		on; avoid the disappointments of
		life.  Come on, move.'

	She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
	curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
	T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
	the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

	VIEW:

	A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
	morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
	HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the
	air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
	horror of the night...

	O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.

	CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
	handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

				HELEN
			(carefully)
		Yes?
			(listens)
		You son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
		a bitch...

	Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

				HELEN
		You filthy... son of a bitch!

	On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
	move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

				COMPUTER
			(filter)
		You Queen is in check.
		Protect your Queen.

	OVER CREDITS:

	HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
	morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
	a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
	near the end of a satisfactory run.

	THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
	SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
	AT WORK HERE.

	NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S
	OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE

	A SCREAM!

	END TITLE AND CREDITS:

	INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

	MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
	DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...

	THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
	centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
	shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
	FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
	in the circle.

				M.J. (V.O.)
		My third grade teacher at the
		convent shot better than that.

	THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.

				RUBEN
		Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

	We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
	HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
	young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
	appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
	thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
	sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
	sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
	even smaller and younger than she is.

	RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
	in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
	and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
	belt.

	M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
	AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

				M.J.
		I'd feel a whole lot safer with
		Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look
		at this guy: you shredded him!

				RUBEN
		Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
		now.

	The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
	to shooting position.

				M.J.
		It's sloppy shooting.  It's in
		character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
		And bad for your career.

	RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
	circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

				RUBEN
		I've been practicing.  Now can I
		kiss your tummy?

	M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

				M.J.
		Perp's holding a hostage, the
		shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
		be exposed.

	SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
	fire.

				M.J.
		Answer it.

				RUBEN
		I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
		you at least interested in which
		one it is?

	She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
	answers, she raises her gun and aims...

				RUBEN
			(into phone)
		I'm here, where are you?...
		Heeeeyyy!  What a surprise!  No.  On
		duty, have to call you back... You,
		too, you too.  My God, you made my
		day.

	He hits the "end" button...

				M.J.
		You hit the brachial nerve...

	SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
	inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
	IN THE MIDDLE!

				M.J.
		You're good enough you'll never
		have to kill anyone.  I joined the
		cops to save lives, not waste them.

				RUBEN
		You know, M.J., when I watch you
		shoot, I realize I've got a little
		problem with my stance... could you
		just move over here and critique my
		legs?

	He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
	She is unloading her weapon...

				M.J.
		The problem is between your legs.
		You told your shrink about that?

	She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

				RUBEN
		I tell my shrink about you,
		Sergeant.  I tell him you're the
		top cop of my dreams.

	Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
	he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
	one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

				M.J.
			(putting away her
			 gear)
		Don't take that mess in the car.

	They're on the move; as they go away from us...

				RUBEN
		He's in love with you already...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
	Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
	thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
	is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
	A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
	SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
	M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

				M.J.
		Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
		here.

	She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
	of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

				RUBEN
		Hey.  And there's the Haircut right
		behind.  If she stops short he's
		gonna be there feet up her ass...

				SUSAN
			(on camera)
		Inspector, can you...

				M.J.
		I just got here myself, Susan.

				SUSAN
		...confirm this third murder adds
		up to a pattern?  Do we have a
		serial killer on the loose in the
		city?

				M.J.
		I just got here.  Talk to you
		later...

				M.J.
			(as they escape behind the
			 barrier tape)
		What the hell does she want to do,
		scare everybody to death?

				RUBEN
		That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
		here already.

	QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
	stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
	As they climb up toward him...

				QUINN
		I been waiting... I have to do
		everything myself.  Photo, crime
		tech, the Coroner are already
		inside.  The Landlady calls it in;
		tenant is not answering when
		called, she sticks her head in,
		sees the body, uses the deceased's
		telephone to call 911.  Otherwise
		nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
		kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
		and the Haircut.

	M.J. and Ruben enter...

	INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY

	Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
	at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
	chain-smoking (the Landlady).

				M.J.
			(to cop)
		That the Landlady?
			(to Ruben)
		You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
			(back to cops)
		Who was first on the scene?

	Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

				MIKE
		I was.

				M.J.
			(forcefully)
		I'm over here?  What's your name,
		Officer?

				MIKE
		Michael Johnson.

				M.J.
		You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
		anything?  Use the doorknob?  I
		don't want to find your prints on
		anything later and you tell me you
		forgot to tell me.

				MIKE
		No.  I didn't.

	She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
	DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
	still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
	pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
	leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
	slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

	Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
	MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.

	M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
	Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
	finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
	men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
	them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
	body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
	THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
	
	ON M.J.:
	
				DOC (V.O.)
		Liver and rigor are telling me
		about eight hours.  I'm gonna take
		her out now if it's alright.

				M.J.
		I'm seeing ligature marks on her
		neck here, petechial hemorrhages in
		her eyes.  Strangled.

				DOC
		You got it.  Same as the other two.

	THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

				COP (V.O.)
		Tell whoever she can't come to the
		phone, she's all tied up.

	Nobody laughs...

				M.J.
		That's real old material, get a new
		writer...

	She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
	it in tissue someone hands her...

				M.J.
		Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
			(extremely cheerful)
		Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
		are you this morning?

				M.J.
		What is this about, Ms Martinez?

				PHONE VOICE
		I'm conducting a telephone survey
		to determine whether you're
		satisfied with your insurance on
		your personal valuables...

	M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
	Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

				DOC
		He used something soft, like a
		stocking or a bathrobe tie.

				M.J.
		Anybody find it?

	No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
	lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
	into the dead woman's eyes...

				M.J.
		Cover her up, please.

	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
	approaches Mike... takes him aside...

				M.J.
		Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's
		bothering you?

	Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

				M.J.
		Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
		and sooner is a hell of lot better
		than later.

				MIKE
		Well, there's something missing in
		there.  There was something around
		her neck when I came in there, but
		it's gone now.

				M.J.
		Who came in after you?

				MIKE
		Lieutenant  Quinn.

	She seems relieved.  Brightly:

				M.J.
		Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
		Thanks.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

	In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the
	scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming
	out...

				M.J.
			(to Photographer)
		Get me good faces on the crowd
		here.  Get a couple of harness bulls
		to grab anybody who starts to
		run...

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Don't tell your Grandmother how to
		suck eggs.  I only been doing this
		work since your junior prom,
		darling...

	But M.J. is already on to other things.

	INT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	CLOSE ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER THAT LIES ON THE FLOOR FIVE OR
	FIX FEET FROM THE DOOR TO HELEN'S APARTMENT.  HOLD DOOR IN
	B.G.

	The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and
	Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look
	of despair.

	HELEN'S POV

	The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

	HELEN

	As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach
	it.

	POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia
	manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL
	STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;
	SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

	HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
	into the hall...

	POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.
	The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

	HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward
	the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and
	squirms back inside.

	INT. APARTMENT - DAY

	As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for
	breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the
	newspaper... INSERT:

	POLICE BAFFLED IN DEATHS OF THE WOMEN

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Damn fools!

							CUT TO:

	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.
	Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

				SUSAN
		... continues to stonewall the
		public.  Now...

	There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

				M.J.
		You messed with the scene.

				QUINN
		Shut up.

	He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

				SUSAN
		... third Bay Area woman has been
		strangled, but the police continue
		to deny that this is the work of
		one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn
		declares that the murders will be
		treated as unrelated crimes, unless
		new evidence...

	M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...

				M.J.
		You messed with the evidence.

				QUINN
		I tagged the goddamned stocking.
		It ain't lost.  We're sequestering
		that evidence.  That's the trap some
		son of a bitch is going to fall
		into...

				M.J.
		Am I in charge of this thing?  Or
		not.

				QUINN
		I said you were...

				NH
		Then I decided what evidence we
		choose to sequester.

				QUINN
			(a beat here)
		Okay.  What do you want to
		sequester?

				M.J.
		The stocking around the neck.

	A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

				QUINN
		You didn't say serial killer and I
		didn't say serial killer.

				M.J.
		Right.

				QUINN
			(not satisfied she
			 really means it)
		This is the anniversary of the
		summer of love and your city
		fathers have declared a Festival of
		Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of
		Commerce don't want TV announcing
		killers on the loose.

				M.J.
		Right.

	And she starts to go...

				QUINN
		We're gonna have a bunch of clapped
		out old hippies blissing on the
		Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the
		park, smoking dope and sticking
		tulips up their ass.

				M.J.
			(exiting)
		Good.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known
	sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add
	to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these
	people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall
	intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false
	confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

				NIKKO
		Harvey, I don't want you in here no
		more, making false statements...

				CONFESSOR
		They are not false.  We pay for
		city government like this, you
		don't even care about the truth?!
		I killed her in the bathtub.

				NIKKO
		Why?

				CONFESSOR
		Because she was dirty, a dirty
		girl!

				NIKKO
		How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

				HARVEY
		With a knife?

				NIKKO
		Good guess, but not good enough.
		Get the fuck outta here...

	He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He
	falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
	is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
	hygiene checkup...

				NIKKO
		What am I wasting my time with this
		shit for?

				M.J.
		Because it's your job, that's all.

				NIKKO
		Not what I meant; why me?

				M.J.
			(cutting)
		Maybe it's something you did in
		this life, Nikko...

	It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
	argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

				NIKKO
		Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

	Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

				M.J.
			(to Ruben)
		Get Mercer to run the medical,
		dental, legal bills, laundry and
		dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
		ators, mailmen, grocery and
		drugstore deliveries, handymen,
		plumbers...

				RUBEN
		It's mostly done, they got nobody
		in common, the three of them... No
		mutual friends -- the Landlady says
		nobody was ever there, she never
		saw her with anybody.

	They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on
	phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

				PACHULSKI
			(into phone)
		Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk
		her right now... because she's 
		busy, she's all tied up.
			(sotto to M.J.)
		Deep Throat's back.

	He hits the speaker phone...

				FEMALE PHONE VOICE
		This is the third one.  You've got
		a serial killer here.  When are you
		going to start warning people?

				PACHULSKI
			(whispering)
		Fourteen calls from this broad.
		And she ain't stupid.

	M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,
	switches off the speaker...

				M.J.
		Who is this?

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

	HELEN on phone

				HELEN
		Who is this?

				M.J.
		Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm
		in charge here.

				PACHULSKI
			(amused)
		Ask her about the moon bike.

				M.J.
		I'm really interested in your
		ideas.  The moon bike.  What is
		that?

				HELEN
		What is wrong with you people?
		The first two, I thought he might
		be on a lunar cycle because they
		were 28 days apart, but obviously
		not.  This new one is only two
		weeks.

	Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
	not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

				HELEN (cont'd)
		You want to joke about moonbikes?!

				M.J.
		No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And
		neither is tying up telephone lines
		to police with crank calls while
		people in trouble are trying to get
		through for help.

				HELEN
		You're calling me a crank?

				M.J.
		Do you have any evidence to report,
		ma'am?  Do you know any of the
		victims...

				HELEN
		I think this is number three...

				M.J.
			(over her)
		That's an opinion, not evidence...

	Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
	at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on
	the slip of paper...

				M.J.
			(covers the phone)
		Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back
		here?

	As she turns back to the phone...

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
	she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
	looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a
	key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her
	assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and
	mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
	face...

				HELEN
		Where were you?  Don't tell me.
		It's just under seventy, right?  The
		sun is strong but the air is dry
		and fresh...

				ANDY
		Would you please get your hands off
		my face, Tallulah?  What happened
		to the newspaper?

	He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
	When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

				HELEN
		I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

				ANDY
		Well!  Aren't we the daring one?
		What's morbid and ghastly enough in
		the news to make Doctor Helen set
		foot outside her door?  The antenna
		is gone off her car again.  I had
		no music, all the way to the
		market.  Let me find a garage for
		it?

	They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
	expensive goodies...

				HELEN
		I've told you:  I can't afford to
		garage it.

				ANDY
		Are you kidding?  You buy enough
		gourmet junk every week... most of
		which rots... to garage a fleet of
		stretch limos.

				HELEN
		I had the dream again.
			(beat)
		And I got another call.  This time
		he spoke.  He said "You and me, you
		and me."

				ANDY
		A little heavy breathing is what
		most of us yearn for.  Forget it.

				HELEN
		He whispered, but it was him!  I
		know it was him!

	Andy now stops to address this seriously...

				ANDY
		He can't phone you unless the
		warden gets an okay from you.  Did
		you give him an approval?

				HELEN
		Andy?  When a three-year-old says
		there's a monster under the bed,
		you don't say 'forget it'.  You
		look under the bad.
			(beat)
		I'm three years old.  Call the
		prison.

	Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
	breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

				HELEN
		Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

				ANDY
		When was the last time you washed
		your hair?

				HELEN
			(shaky, but trying)
		Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
		coiffure?

				ANDY
		Monsieur Andy can smell your
		coiffure.  And guess what else?

	He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

				ANDY
		Cellulite.  What do you say I
		blindfold you and take you to the
		gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

	HELEN AT WINDOW

				HELEN
		Andy?

	Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

				ANDY
		Here we go again.

	ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET

	In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
	face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

				HELEN
		You parked right behind him.  The
		one I noticed earlier.  I didn't
		say anything, I thought he'd leave.
		Just take a look.

				ANDY
		Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A
		NEWSPAPER!

				HELEN
		But earlier, he was staring up
		here.  Please, Andy.

				ANDY
		Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'
		coming up.

	ANDY leaves the apartment.

	EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

	The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
	peers out, sees:

	ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
	up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
	THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.

				ANDY
		Excuse me, but would you mind
		explaining why you're watching the
		lady upstairs?

				RUBEN
		None of your fucking business.

	Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
	close to RUBEN'S window.

				ANDY
		Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

	RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
	car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
	ANDY'S nose.

				RUBEN
		I hate this...

				ANDY
		Only kidding!

	RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
	head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
	door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
	position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,
	RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

	M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES
	FAST AND GETS OUT.

	HELEN at window, shouting.

				HELEN
		I'm calling the police!

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her
	badge to Helen.

				M.J.
		Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I
		apologize for Goetz, he's a
		firehouse dog.

				ANDY
			(trying to defuse)
		I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed
		it.

	Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
	what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is
	confused, fighting back fear...

				M.J.
			(trying to communicate
			 here)
		Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor
		impulse control.

				HELEN
		Is he out?

				M.J.
		Who?

				HELEN
			(to Andy)
		If he's not out, why are they here?

				M.J.
		Because of your phone calls.

				HELEN
		What calls?  I haven't made any
		calls.

				ANDY
			(to distract)
		Are you staying long?  Shall I shut
		the door?  Make your coffee?  Make
		the beds?

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		You talked to me.  Do you remember?

	The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
	control herself.  A beat.

				HELEN
		You were the one that talked about
		moonbikes and called me a crank?
		Oh God, I am!
			(to Andy)
		Make them some coffee.
			(to M.J.)
		Halloran, is it?  Investigator
		Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--
		he said...
			(a moment of real
			 fear)
		I thought it might be Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I thought he might be out
		of prison.

				RUBEN
		Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think
		so.  If he's escaped we'd have the
		National Guard, cops'd be crawling
		through sewers.  You'd have a guard
		on your front door.

				M.J.
			(looking around)
		I want to tell you it's a great
		honor to meet you and talk to you.

				HELEN
		You don't admire me.  No police
		admire me.  I got one of you
		killed.  Why don't you say right
		out what you're here for?

				M.J.
		You called us, Doctor Hudson.

				HELEN
		Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.
		The accounts of the firs two
		murders made it so clear they were
		the work of the same man, but you
		kept announcing they were
		unrelated.  You'll never catch him
		that way.

	M.J. regards her for a moment...

				M.J.
			(to Andy)
		Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
		mine black.
			(beat)
		You're absolutely correct.  The
		politicians don't want panic
		headlines spoiling the Festival of
		Love.

				HELEN
		Well, let's thank God you and
		Inspector Goetz are on the case,
		then.

				M.J.
		Would you want to work with us on
		this?

				HELEN
		Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical
		hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
		anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
		afraid of everything, real and
		imaginary.  I never leave this
		apartment now.  Nobody ever comes
		here.  I just wanted to get your
		attention.  I write and I used to
		lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
		not competent.

				M.J.
		I think you are.  I really admire
		everything you've done; it would be
		an honor to work with you, and we
		need all the help we can get,
		especially yours.

				HELEN
		Inspector Halloran, that is so much
		bullshit, you don't like or admire
		me, but the beautiful part is I
		don't give a fuck.  That's the
		upside of having a breakdown.

				M.J.
		Well, it's a hell of an apartment
		you got here.  I'm living one step
		away from the projects, myself, but
		I get to go to work every day,
		wading in blood and guts.  I guess
		the books you wrote about these
		sons of bitches paid off pretty
		good.

				HELEN
		Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

				M.J.
		You can't go out lecturing?  Tough
		shit.  Women are dying.  Where can
		I lay this stuff out?

	She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
	table.

				HELEN
		I don't want this.  What are they?

				RUBEN
		You called us, Doctor, if you don't
		want to look at them here, how
		about downtown.  I'll drive you
		down...

	She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
	to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
	force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

	Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen
	fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
	back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
	FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

	THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
	she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
	treating her very gently...

				ANDY
			(to Ruben)
		Now look what you did.

				RUBEN
		What did I do?

				ANDY
		You threatened to drive her
		downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

				RUBEN
		Fear of what...

				ANDY
		Open space.  She hasn't been out of
		this apartment in three years.  I
		didn't used to think it was real...

	He's making her comfortable.

				M.J.
		We'll get the paramedics...

				ANDY
		Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
		Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:
		she hyperventilates till she passes
		out, then her breathing goes back
		to normal, and she wakes up singing
		like a lark.
			(rocking the
			 unconscious Helen)
		We know, don't we, Princess?
			(to them)
		Give her a couple of hours.  I know
		about this.

	M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is
	angry and disgusted.

				M.J.
		Tell her we're sorry we bothered
		her.

				ANDY
		Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you
		really want her help.  I mean if
		you really do, leave them.  Let her
		see them.  I'll see they're safe...

	M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
	Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
	strewn around.  Makes a decision...

				M.J.
		Tell her to ask for me...

	She's handing Andy her card...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	M.J. AND RUBEN come out in the street...  CAMERA IN A HIGH
	ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...

				M.J.
		Snotty neurotic bitch...

				RUBEN
			(amused)
		Classy madonna.

				M.J.
		Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She
		likes the way you move.  She sure
		as hell isn't in love with me.

				RUBEN
		You came in there with this
		attitude...

				M.J.
			(over him)
		Order Chinese for us and meet me
		the library?  Anything but beef.

	She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move
	to his car.  AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER
	ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.

	We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN
	HIS ARMS.  SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY.  DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE
	PHONE RING.  ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY
	DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.

	HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME.  THE SHOT
	HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT.  PHONE RINGS.

	THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER
	POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES
	ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING
	WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE
	ANDY ENTERS.  WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO
	IT.  HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.

	THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS
	RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.

	INT. POLICE LIBRARY - DAY

	CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

				ATTORNEY
		... it was your feeling after
		careful evaluation that he was a
		sexual sadist who satisfied at
		least four out of ten criteria in
		the DMS III?

	SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
	takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
	Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of
	arrogance, which is her undoing...

				HELEN
		Yes.  Without question.

				ATTORNEY
		Without question?  He only scored
		40 percent, four out of ten
		criteria?  Couldn't another expert
		say he flunked the sexual sadist
		test?  What curve are you marking
		on, Doctor?

				HELEN
		The test criteria are only part of
		what we look at in evaluating
		subjects.

				ATTORNEY
		Only part.  What else?  What did
		you think of his claim that he tied
		this girl to the tree and set fire
		to her because Joan of Arc told him
		to do it.

				HELEN
		He was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked
		you what you thought, not what he
		did.

				HELEN
		I thought he was lying.

				ATTORNEY
		You said, first, he was lying.  How
		do you know that, Doctor?

				HELEN
		Because people who are suffering
		from aural hallucinations hear
		voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee
		told me that Joan of Arc always
		appeared beside him on his left
		side and spoke softly in his left
		ear.

	Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

				HELEN
			(emboldened)
		He took pains to hide his actions
		because he knew they were morally
		wrong.  He was not acting on mad
		impulse.  He was sane and acting
		out a pattern he carefully followed
		every time.

				ATTORNEY
			(playing causal)
		What pattern was that?

				HELEN
		The same as the first time...

	She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
	tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
	Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
	by the line this questioning is taking.

				ATTORNEY
		The first what?
			(as she hesitates)
		Your Honor, she's got this far, I
		think she should finish.  I don't
		think this jury should be left
		wondering where the rest of her
		statement would lead.

				JUDGE
		I agree, Doctor.

				HELEN
		The first two murders.

				ATTORNEY
		What first two murders.  We don't
		know about them here, do we?

				HELEN
			(giving up)
		He told me he had done two others
		just like it.

				ATTORNEY
		When was that?

				HELEN
		When he was seventeen.

				ATTORNEY
		And you believed him when he told
		you he had done that.

				HELEN
		Yes.  I believed him.

	The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

				JUDGE (V.O.)
		Yes, I'll accept a call for a
		mistrial.  Evidence of that other
		crime when the defendant was a
		juvenile is inadmissible and never
		should have been heard by this
		jury...

	FREEZE FRAMES.

	NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,
	THINKING...

	THE DOOR OPENS AND QUINN ENTERS.

				QUINN
		There was no sperm.

				M.J.
		The same as the firs two.
		Definitely a serial.

				QUINN
			(seeing HELEN on

		What are you looking at that for?
		Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

				M.J.
		What clues?  I'm going to work
		Helen Hudson.

				QUINN
		Would you step outside, Sergeant?

	M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN.  Once the door shuts,

		I'm telling you.  Don't you ever

		You'll work what and who I tell you
		to work.

				M.J.
		Anybody in this department ever
		worked a serial killer case?  She's
		the expert.  I need help.

				QUINN
		How about I put Nikko on it?

				M.J.
		That's always your privilege, sir.

	QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

				QUINN
		Sergeant?

				M.J.
		Yessir.

				QUINN
		You ever reflect how this big
		explosion in dead women coincides
		with the flowering of women's lib?

				M.J.
		Yessir.  I have reflected on that,
		sir.  Which explains my gushing
		deference to you, sir.

	QUINN is somehow cheered by this little exchange.

				QUINN
		Nikko's looking better by the
		minute, Inspector.

	He stomps off.

	HELEN on couch, ANDY is massaging her neck.

				HELEN
		Oh, God.  I must have looked
		horrible.

				ANDY
		No, dear.  You're at your best with
		a bag in front of your face.

				HELEN
		I want to die.

				ANDY
		I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you
		want him.  The cute brutal type
		with handcuffs.  Very sexy.

	HELEN grins, and ANDY starts to tickle her, she laughs.

				ANDY
		You thought he was cute too, didn't
		you?  Admit... admit...

	HELEN now laughing a little too hard.  Suddenly the laughter
	changes to tears.

				ANDY
		What?  What'd I do?

				HELEN
		Reminded me that I used to be
		attractive.  That men used to want
		me...

				ANDY
		You slut!  No sexy young cop for
		you unless you shampoo your hair.

	She clings desperately to him.  He rocks her as he would a
	small child.

				ANDY
		When are you going to call them?

				HELEN
			(big beat)
		About what?

	ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at
	it.  Andy watches her...

				HELEN
		I can't, Andy.

				ANDY
		Then, why don't you just die.  I'm
		going.  They'll find your body
		years later, the old recluse lady,
		she ate cat food, ten years of the
		New York Times, unread, piled on
		top of the unread mail, the TV
		still on.  Make up your mind.  Live
		or die.
			(beat)
		I'll get coffee.

	He exits.  After a moment fighting her fears, Helen reaches
	for the file.  She opens it and looks at the first picture.
	THE PHONE RINGS.  She freezes... Panic hangs in the air...
	Andy answers the phone in the kitchen...

				ANDY (O.S.)
		Yes?  Inspector Halloran, she's
		going through the material now.
			(beat)
		She'll call you... No, she'll be

	M.J. looks at him at last with wry amusement: he's jealous 
	of Ruben?
	
				M.J.
		Well, you outranked me, Nikko.

				NIKKO
		Yeah.  And you used that. Used me

				M.J.
		Don't put yourself down like that.
		I never used you.  I worked my way

				NIKKO
		Yeah, you did that too.  You earned

		God, you're cute when you're mad.

	The door opens and RUBEN enters, instantly takes in the

	looming over her.  After an awkward beat, NIKKO heads for

				NIKKO
		Think about it.

	RUBEN regards M.J., who busies herself examining the other
	tapes.

				RUBEN
		What's wrong with him?

				M.J.
		He's just mad he let me keep the

	kneels on the grass, weeding a lush flowerbed.  The CAMERA
	SWISHHPANS TO the back door of the house as a man comes out
	balancing a tray with drinks.  The woman gives the man a

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

	CLOSE UP:  early crime scene photos.

	WE SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST TWO MURDER VICTIMS, SO
	WE SEE THE PATTERN HELEN DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		The way he's posed the bodies...
		he's flaunting his power to do
		whatever he wants to her.  This
		man... He probably seems perfectly
		normal.  These murders are organized
		and planned.

	WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
	IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one
	picture from the rest...

				HELEN
		Except for this one.  You put that
		one in to test me.

	M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>

	INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with
	bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Is it an ongoing case?

	BACK TO SCENE...

				M.J.
			(nods)
		For months... last October.

				HELEN
		It was a lover or a husband.
		Someone close.  Somebody who knew
		her and cared about her.

				M.J.
			(glancing at Ruben)
		How do you know that?

				HELEN
		He felt remorse.  He covered her.

	HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

				HELEN
		The bodies have been carefully
		arranged... different positions,
		but somehow the same.  The
		positions are brutal... yet
		quite... artful.  It's like... a
		signature.  He's proud of his
		accomplishments.  There are early
		Picassos and late Picassos, but you
		always recognize the hand.  He
		wants us to recognize his hand.
		I've seen this hand before... what
		are you hiding?

				M.J.
			(taken aback)
		Nothing.

				HELEN
		Where are the stockings he
		strangled them with?

				M.J.
		How did you know they were
		stockings?

				HELEN
			(sarcastic)
		I sent Andy out on murder missions.
		For God's sake -- it's the Boston
		Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used
		their own stockings to strangle
		them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

	She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
	pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

				HELEN
		Somebody is imitating his m.o.
		Look for a plumber or carpenter or
		handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
		the door and caught them off guard.

				RUBEN
		The Boston Strangler, when was
		that...?

				HELEN
		In the sixties.  He's dead --
		stabbed to death in prison.

				M.J.
		Why imitate a dead serial killer?

				HELEN
		If you knew why, you might know
		where to look for him.
		I don't envy you this; he's not
		done -- he's going to do them faster
		and faster to keep the adrenaline
		rush.  Now, I've done what you 
		asked me.

				M.J.
		Work with me.

				ANDY (O.S.)
		It's good for you.

	They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

				ANDY
		It's good medicine.

				RUBEN
		A little homeopathic cure for the
		willies.

				HELEN
			(exhausted)
		None of you know anything about it.
		Now go.  And Andy, if you persist
		in playing doctor, leave, with
		them.

				ANDY
		I'm the only friend you've got,
		darling, and I don't intend to stop
		doing what I think is good for us.

				HELEN
		Get out!  All of you!

	Andy helps M.J. and Ruben scoop up the files...

				RUBEN
		You said you don't give a fuck and

		This doesn't look like not giving a

		Don't swear at me because we got

		news.  I went to a Catholic school;
		I'll tell you what they teach.  On

				QUINN
		Who've I got to beat up except the
		messenger?  Does this give us
		anything to go on?

				M.J.
		I'm checking out anybody who lives
		like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests
		for rape, especially by a man
		wearing green.  Checking out
		psychiatric hospitals for his
		personality profile.  Cross check-
		ing names from arrests for sexual
		offenses, public fondling.  If
		they've got a German wife.  We can
		keep cops working on this kind of
		junk for years, and this guy's
		going to hit again, soon.

				QUINN
			(morose)
		I know.  Get out here.

				M.J.
		So.  Do we tell the media and hope
		for somebody to come forward with
		information?

				QUINN
		Or for some new nutcase to copycat
		the copycat.

				RUBEN
		What I love, the big fight, some
		girl, she drops the quarter on her

	Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the

	Hands, feet, breasts, hair of two bodies mixed mischievously

		I am not going to look at any more

				M.J.
		I don't look at pictures.  I look
		at the real thing.  I don't feel
		infected.

				HELEN
		Maybe that's why you can't catch
		him.  I know what she looks like --
		the red-headed woman in my
		computer.

				M.J.
		I just came from her... here's what
		you haven't seen.

	M.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her
	manner is that of cop with a witness.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		A forgery of the Mary Sullivan
		murder scene, he's done it perfect.
		Except for the sign.

				HELEN
			(looking at photo)
		She probably let him in the door
		without a thought.  Where are their
		mothers?!  Where are the mothers
		that are supposed to teach them to
		be wary and to tough and not afraid
		to fight?

				M.J.
		Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
		Festival of Love?  You make any
		sense in that?

	HELEN stares at the picture.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
		talking to you.

				HELEN
		It's anybody connected to author-
		ity.  They write, they even knock
		on your door.  They're fans.  It
		thrills them to flirt with getting
		caught.

				M.J.
		Nobody knows you have anything to
		do with this case; nothing has been
		on TV or the news... Why would he
		want to get in your computer?

				HELEN
		Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!
		His, all of them!  They know me.
		They're in prisons with libraries,
		they collect clippings, I'm their
		worthy opponent.  You keep my name
		out of this.

				RUBEN
		Absolutely.

				M.J.
		My promise.

	Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.

				ANDY
		The moon is up, my night to howl.
		Will you be okay?

				HELEN
		Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You
		go.  Poor thing, you ought to get
		out.

				ANDY
			(to M.J.)
		Look out for her.  She's tougher
		than you think.

	He goes...

				HELEN
		I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest
		of it?

				RUBEN
		MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

				HELEN
		MaryJane.  You think that logic and
		police procedure, order and science
		and method will hold back the
		horrors of a world gone mad and the
		sickness of the night.  I did once.
		But you know how he'll get caught?
		He'll have an accident, or some cop
		will get lucky.  You can't catch
		him by being intelligent and
		working hard.  Or the worst:  there
		are dozens of women slaughtered in
		the most horrible way, month after
		month.  The news stories grow more
		grotesque and bizarre and in the
		city people lock their doors and
		windows, and hurry home before
		dark.  And then, one day, there are
		no more.  What happened?  Did he
		just stop?  Get tired and disgusted
		and decide not to kill any more?
		Did he kill himself?  Did he die in
		an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
		get sick and die?  It's like the
		murderer walked off the edge of the
		earth.  And you never know.  But
		you keep asking yourself -- when you
		read about a new murder -- is he
		back?

	M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
	story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

				M.J.
		That's amazing.  A whole new book,
		thought up in a minute.  Very good.
			(beat)
		All I know how t do is get up,
		take a shower, and go to work.
		Hope, if he does another I'll nail
		the son of bitch, and they'll spell
		my name right in the newspaper.
		Where is Andy going?

				HELEN
		He's going home.  He slept over
		because I was a little anxious...

				M.J.
		I want a guard on you.  I'm worried
		about leaving you alone.

				RUBEN
			(to M.J.)
		We're through for the night, aren't
		we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.
		I'll stay until we can get a man
		out here and maybe catch a cab
		home.

				HELEN
		That would be much appreciated.
		Thanks.

				M.J.
			(to Helen)
		Somewhere down the line we're doing
		to find a connection between him
		and you.  I want you to worry that
		idea like a loose tooth.

	Three voices chime self-conscious 'Good-nights.'

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	THE SILENT WATCHER'S POV through the eye of the
	CAMCORDER, we catch M.J. exit HELEN'S building.  She stops
	momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window...
	The drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT
	THE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.
	She gets into her car and speeds off.

	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben is checking the windows...

				RUBEN
		You ought to get some decent locks
		on these.  A six-year-old could get
		in here.  Much less a motivated
		man.

	At the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the
	eye.
  				HELEN
		You and MaryJane aren't lovers.

				RUBEN
		Not yet.

	HELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her laughter,
	attracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the
	heat.

				HELEN
		Are you always so bold?

				RUBEN
		No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

	His grin says he'd select her anytime...

				RUBEN
		The problem for me is... you're in
		the witness category.
			(beat -- Jack
			 Nicholson)
		Know what I mean?

				HELEN
		Well.  Another time, then.
			(beat)
		I'll be all right.  He's not going
		to attack me; what I' m rally
		afraid of is all in my own head,
		Ruben.

	They smile ruefully at one another, and without further
	conversation, leave the bedroom.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	RUBEN is outside the door.  HELEN just inside.

				RUBEN
		They'll have a guard here tomorrow.
		I know you have the idea, but it'll
		make me feel a lot better.

	She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the
	doorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he
	suddenly stops.

				RUBEN
		Hey!

	He turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches
	for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

				RUBEN
		The number for my cellular.

				RUBEN
		Don't hesitate.  Anytime.  Night or
		day.  I mean that.

	He hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door
	frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
	with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
	in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
	HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
	determined not to have any further mortification this night,
	she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
	Then a second step and a third.

	Her hand touches the card, takes it.

	She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
	What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
	quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
	Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

	HER POV:

	RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
	turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
	narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
	miles and miles of space between the two walls.

				HELEN
		Oh, God!  Help me!

	RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

				RUBEN
		Tell me what to do!

				HELEN
		I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

	She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
	catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
	a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
	spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
	is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
	panic...

				HELEN
		...falling... FALLING!

	He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
	her against the feeling of free-fall.

				RUBEN
		I'm right here.  I won't let you
		fall.

	He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
	proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
	begins to hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		Don't let go... I can't breathe...
		I'll die!

				RUBEN
		Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
		I'll fix it...

	RUBEN takes out his gun...

				RUBEN
		Put your hands over your ears.

	RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
	carries her back into her apartment.

	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
	up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
	to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
	water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
	takes the bottle and pockets it.

				HELEN
		The lock...

				RUBEN
		I'll get a locksmith.

				HELEN
		Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
		to sleep... I don't want...him...in
		my head...

	RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
	close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
	nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

	CLOSE UP HELEN:

	We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

				V.O.
		Peter... Peter...

							CROSS FADE TO:

	INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

	Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
	comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
	She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
	older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
	DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
	video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

	THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

	PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
	Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
	his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
	the tape on 'eject.'

				WOMAN
		Put in the Kevin Costner.

				PETER
		Why don't we save it for later?
		It's almost time for Letterman.

				WOMAN
		You know I don't like to watch talk
		shows by myself.  Where're you?

	He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
	approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
	lock of hair back from the forehead.

	She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
	DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.

				WOMAN
		See, now you've annoyed her.  You
		know she doesn't like you to touch
		me.
			(to dog)
		Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
		you so much!
			(to Peter)
		Did you feed her?

				PETER
		Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's
		hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

				WOMAN
		She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
		her?

				PETER
		She lies all the time.  Why would I
		say I fed her if I didn't?

				WOMAN
		That's what I don't know.  Why
		would you lie?  That's the
		problem... I can't understand why
		anyone would lie.

	He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
	to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

				WOMAN (cont'd)
		You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
		you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
		Such a naughty widdle dog...

	HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
	small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
	then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
	basement door behind him.

	THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
	and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
	small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
	freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
	outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

	PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
	something to turn the video back on.

	The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
	the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
	table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
	but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
	asphyxiated by slow degrees.

	PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
	repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
	toward his wife.  He whispers:

				PETER
		Didn't I promise I'd come right
		back?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

	ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
	glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
	down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
	of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
	few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
	CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
	number of unmarked cars.

	RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

	As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
	THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
	stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
	away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

				RUBEN
		Up all night with a sick friend.

	NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

				NIKKO
		You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
		even know how to treat a woman.

				RUBEN
		Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
		me why she gave you the boot...

	He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
	WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
	now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
	a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
	photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

				RUBEN
		Is Niccoletti assigned here?

				M.J.
			(angry about it)
		Quinn decided we should form a task
		force -- they're all one case, now.
		He wants all the senior detectives
		on it...
			(to Doc)
		She wasn't killed here.

				DOC
		Not likely.

	M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
	beside her... to Ruben...

				M.J.
		Tell me what you see.

	He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

				RUBEN
		She didn't fight back, no hair or
		skin under her fingernails.  I'm
		not seeing any bruises or
		contusions...

				M.J.
		What about her arms?

				RUBEN
		Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at
		this...

	Nikko appears, looming over her...

				NIKKO
		Probably so stoned she never knew
		what got her.  Like Goetz's sick
		friend.  Right Goetz?

	They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

				RUBEN
		She's blue as hell.  No marks on her
		neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --
		no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

				M.J.
		Look at her legs.

				RUBEN
		Spread out like she was sexually
		assaulted here.

				DOC
		After she was dead.

				RUBEN
		She was dragged up here from the
		road, you can see the tracks.  She
		was already dead or unconscious.
		Let's get plaster casts on any --
		all footprints.

				M.J.
		If this is just the dump site,
		where did he do the job?  Where did
		he pick her up?

				NIKKO
		Doped up kids all over town.  Park
		was full of them last night.  Very
		easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

	Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
	Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
	them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

				M.J.
		What the hell are you doing?  The
		Mouth and the Haircut are right
		down there, thank God they didn't
		see that.

	Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
	of-Lovers.

				M.J.
		Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
		side of the tape, you want to push
		them back?  Now.

	Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
	RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
	her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
	hillside to their cars...

				M.J.
		Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
		on report.

				RUBEN
		You're right.  I can't stand that
		bastard.  Sorry.
			(getting back to
			 work)
		This is something new.  Not the
		same guy, that's for sure.

				M.J.
		Yeah, everything's different.

	But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

				M.J.
		Get the pictures, and casts of
		footprints.

				RUBEN
		Look at him, grandstanding...

	Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

				M.J.
		That's all we need...

	She strides toward them...

				M.J.
		Detective Niccoletti?

				SUSAN
		What's this about the Boston
		Strangler, M.J.?

	M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also
	thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
	this point -- or not?

				M.J.
		Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
		the wrong side of the tape.  We're
		still trying to find any footprints
		or tire marks and we don't want to
		chew up the ground, okay?  I'll
		talk to you later.
			(to Nikko)
		You, too.

	She's got Susan outside the tape...

				SUSAN
		Inspector, will you confirm
		somebody is copying the Boston
		Strangler?  This is the fourth, is
		that correct?

				M.J.
		We're going to review all the
		evidence carefully before making
		any statement...

	She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
	side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

				M.J.
		Ruben, put the light on...

	From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
	clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

	M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
	car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
	trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
	familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

				M.J.
		Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,
		never, never mess with somebody
		inside the case!

				RUBEN
		Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do
		you...

				M.J.
		You damn well better start working
		on that impulse control.  A woman
		who is implicated in this case?
		Someone who's practically a piece
		of evidence?

				RUBEN
		It's against your rules that I try
		to help a witness who's scared
		shitless?  Who's...

				M.J.
		The woman's unstable.  You could
		wind up with a harassment charge.
		Anything.  You're like some horny
		little teenager.

	M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
	mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
	tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

				M.J.
		Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
		about that corner.

	Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

				M.J.
		Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
		same clothes from yesterday,
		reeking of sex.

	RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot
	and jumps out.

				M.J.
			(going away)
		Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get
		Doc to lean on the coroner for a
		really fast prelim on the sperm.

	RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

				M.J. (O.S.)
		When you get it, call me.

	RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

				RUBEN
		She loves me.

	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN, NICCOLETTI.

				QUINN
		I know; the kid hit you first.  He
		already told me.

				NIKKO
		He's not treating her right...

				QUINN
		She left you, Nikko.  She's not
		your responsibility.  She takes
		very good care of herself.  If she
		wants to romance the kid, it ain't
		your business.  Your business is to
		snap out of it.

				NIKKO
		We were together six years, sir!

				QUINN
		Don't give me six years!  You never
		divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd
		you expect from M.J.?

				NIKKO
		She knows I'm Catholic!  She never
		mentioned divorce!  Not once!

				QUINN
		Then you shoulda known she wasn't
		buying.  She was just long-term
		leasing' you.
			(beat)
		Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare
		twenty-second twitch, there ain't
		nothin' about sex I don't hate.
		But of course, I'm Irish.
			(beat)
		Plus I got real problems.  I'm
		worried I might have to put you in
		over M.J.  There's something going on
		here, the Commissioner is targeting
		her now, I can't leave a woman in
		that position.  But the thing is,
		how can I move you in, if you go on
		acting like a teenage asshole?

				NIKKO
		I don't want the job.  Don't do
		that to her.  She's worked too
		damned hard for it.

				QUINN
		What's going down with the sting in
		Chinatown?  That gonna be off your
		plate in a week or what?

							CUT TO:

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

	A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT OF THE POLICE HQ IS BEING SET UP TO
	HOUSE A NEW TASK FORCE, WITH CATERER'S TABLE FOR TEMP
	DESKS.  Bulletin boards with notices and pictures; telephone
	techs are still installing phones, cops are learning
	unfamiliar computer menus, etc.  M.J. IS EXAMINING HUGE
	BLOWUPS OF ONLOOKERS AT CRIME SCENES PINNED UP ON A WALL,
	WITH A MAGNIFYING LENS.

				QUINN (V.O.)
		Sergeant...

	She walks away BECKONS, BECKONS, COME ON, WALK AFTER ME!  He
	walks out of a door and they stand on the steps...

	EXT. STEPS POLICE HQ - DAY

	A couple of Cops, maybe male and female, are smoking there.
	Quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside,
	flipping their butts into the shrubbery.  Quinn sighs and
	digs out a cigarette.  The looks between them tell the story
	of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc.

				QUINN
		So what have we got?

				M.J.
		It's not the same guy.  It should be
		a self-solver.  No bow around the
		neck, left and body outdoors,
		completely different.  The others
		were housewives, secretaries, he
		talked his way inside, killed them
		in their own living room or bed- or
		bathroom.  This one didn't have a
		husband or a boyfriend, no family,
		temp waitress, 3 arrests for
		misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI,
		asphyxiation probably from a
		plastic bag over her head.  Sexually
		assaulted.  The others weren't
		molested that way.  We're waiting
		for the sperm tests...

				QUINN
		Christ.  How old are you?  You sure
		you want to be in this line of
		work?

				M.J.
		You're damn right I do.

				QUINN
		Okay, now what about your sidekick
		punching my favorite detective?
		What the hell is going on?  You got
		no discipline in your operation.

				M.J.
		I'm sorry it had to come to your
		attention.  I am dealing with it.

	She starts to go...

				QUINN
		Where you going?

				M.J.
		Helen Hudson...

				QUINN
		What the hell you need her for?

				M.J.
		Because I think I'm wrong.

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  SHAKING HANDS DUMP OUT PILLS.  FOUR.
	SIX.  TWO, PUT BACK.  ONE MORE, PUT BACK.

	HELEN: RAVAGED.  WATCHING HERSELF IN MIRROR AS SHE GULPS THE
	REMAINING PILLS.

	DOOR BELL RINGS O.S.

				HELEN
		I'm not seeing anybody.

	We HEAR muffled voices -- ANDY and M.J.  HELEN, as she
	realizes Andy is letting M.J. in, goes to the bathroom door
	and tries to slam and lock it: Andy beats her to it,
	blocking with his foot in the door.

				HELEN
		You're fired.

				ANDY
		I know.  Do come and meet your
		guest.

	M.J. appears.  Taking in Helen's condition -- due to a wild
	night with Ruben?  Helen moves from the bathroom down the
	hall to her office, as...

				M.J.
		We've got another one.

				HELEN
		That's no surprise.

				M.J.
		But it's a different m.o.

				HELEN
		Then what do you need me for?

				M.J.
		She was killed somewhere else and
	dumped outdoors in an empty lot.
		Where it says "no dumping."  Her
		legs pulled apart in a kind of
		sexual pose.   It's all different
		but it seems so -- the same.
		Artificial and posed... Something's
		wrong with it.

				HELEN
		You're saying it's the same man,
		but he's changed his style?  That
		doesn't happen.  These men are
		robotic; the murder is like a
		ritual.  The method itself is part
		of the pleasure...

	They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

				M.J.
		Who turned off the Internet
		computer...

				HELEN
		I turned it off.  It's like an open
		window he can climb right in...

				M.J.
		He comes in the window, we maybe
		grab him.  Where's the on-switch?

				HELEN
		Have you got a warrant?  Get the
		hell out o here!  This is the
		only space I have left in the
		world!  Why can't you leave me out
		of it?

				M.J.
		Helen -- the killer directly
		contacted you.  His interest in you
		is intense.  I'm worried about you.
		I don't want to lose you.  I know
		this stirs up every monster under
		the bed, but this is the only
		direct contact we have with him.
		The only chance we have to trap
		him.
			(beat)
		So, you can turn Internet back on,
		or I do, and we put somebody here
		on a 24 hour shift and you can
		kick, scream and hyperventilate.

				HELEN
		That little Winona Ryder manner...
		you're more convincing as Clint
		Eastwood.

				M.J.
		Clint is putting a guard on you.
		But if you swear to leave the
		computer on, Winona will assign him
		to the hall outside.

	HELEN has to laugh.  The laugh turns to a hacking cough.

				ANDY
		She's smoking again.

	Andy leaves.  Helen sits, and with the care of someone
	handling a rattlesnake, turns the computer on.  Meanwhile...

	THE PHONE RINGS.

				HELEN
		Hello?... Oh...
			(a beat)
		...yes, she's right here.

	HELEN hangs the phone to M.J.  The air is a little more
	charged... Helen goes back to the computer.

				HELEN
		Ruben.

				M.J.
		Hello, Ruben...
			(listens, nods)
		So that's that...

				HELEN
		Please thank Inspector Goetz for
		taking care of me last night.

	M.J. delivers the message straight-faced.

				M.J.
		Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to
		thank you for taking care of her
		last night.
			(hangs up)
		Lab report on the new one.  At
		least two guys penetrated her.
		There were two kinds of sperm.  The
		poor thing.  What it must have been
		like.

	Helen has come alert...

				HELEN
		She was near a sign that said "No
		Dumping?"  Two kinds of sperm --
		the lab said one was a secretor and
		the other was not?

	M.J. mumbles a surprised yes.  Helen is at computer.

				HELEN
		There were needle marks.  But no
		drugs in her blood.

				M.J.
		So far nothing they test for comes
		up positive.

	Helen has a Window type screen: she clicks icons...

				HELEN
		Is that it?

				M.J.
			(stunned)
		That's exactly... I could have
		taken that same picture, this
		morning.

	A RATHER GRAINY PICTURE OF A DEAD GIRL SPREAD OUT IN A
	SUGGESTIVE POSE IN AN EMPTY FIELD.  A SIGN RIGHT BY HER SAYS
	"NO DUMPING."

				HELEN
		He's switched from DeSalvo to the
		Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler
		was two men, that's why there are
		two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a
		joke, very witty our boy.

				M.J.
		That's not consistent... You said
		they never changed their style,
		they're robots...

				HELEN
		Consistency is the hobgoblin of
		little minds.  Tell them to test
		for the chemicals found in Windex.
		That's a product for cleaning
		with...

				M.J.
		I know Windex, for God's sake, I
		clean my own windows...

				HELEN
		It's what Bianchi and Buono
		injected into one of their victims.

				M.J.
			(sensing something
			 appalling)
		Injected Windex!  Why would he
		switch to a new m.o.?

				HELEN
		Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
		way to nailing him.  Serial killing
		is irrational and rigid and 
		compulsive.  This guy has a plan
		all thought out, flexible and
		complex.  He's playing a game with
		us.  Who will he imitate next?
		Maybe he's doing all the serial
		killers in history, the great
		innovators, the murderers' hall of
		fame.  Just to prove he's better
		than all of them.  They got caught;
		he didn't.

				M.J.
		He'll get caught.  If he has a plan
		that'll be what trips him up...

				HELEN
		Who's going to catch him?  You?
			(beat)
		And if you do, there'll be another
		one.  And one after that.

				M.J.
			(gently, surprised)
		You're afraid of him.

				HELEN
		This one, yes.  I was always
		curious about these twisted little

		I've felt personally terrified of.
		He's something new and unheard of.
		I don't know what he wants.

	INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is empty, the messy unmade bed has covers thrown
	back.  Nasty Little Dog is sprawled asleep on it.  The TV is
	on: SUSAN SCHIFFER'S broadcast... Over SUSAN'S shoulder, big
	and bold, the legend:

	'KOPYCAT KILLER?'

				SUSAN
		...to mimic the M.O. of the Boston
		Strangler.  The police here are
		rumored to be consulting Dr. Helen
		Hudson.

	O.S.  A TOILET FLUSHES, and Peter's WIFE emerges wearing a
	nightgown.  She shuffles back to the bed, and as she sits
	picks up the remote...

				SUSAN (ON TV)
		It was backstage at the McClusky
		Auditorium on the Berkeley campus
		that Dr. Hudson's police bodyguard
		was killed.  Daryll Lee Cullum,
		that...

	She zaps the remote and a program hyping the Summer of Love
	comes on...

	INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	We see on HIS computer screen a picture of HELEN scanned
	from some newspaper or magazine.  PETER is building a morph:
	beside Helen on screen is another image -- of the RED-HEADED
	woman.  He is placing marks on one picture, on the exact
	corner of Helen's left eyes.  As he does so, a red dot
	appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed
	woman.  Both pictures are dappled with similar dots.  It
	looks very odd, as though someone had stuck Post-its all
	over the images.  Around him, as he works are other pictures:
	ASPHYXIATED GIRL taken while she was strapped to the table.
	Of the sign "NO DUMPING."  M.J. leaving Helen's!  HE ALSO HAS
	A TINY TV ON, AND TURNS TO SEE AS:

				SUSAN (ON TV)
		... convicted serial killer had
		escaped police custody during a
		court hearing, in a scandal that
		rocked the police and forced the
		resignation of four State
		Correction officers...

	INT. DEATH ROW CELL - NIGHT

	DARYLL LEE lies smoking and watching a tiny TV of his own.

				SUSAN (ON TV)
		...Cullum attacked Doctor Hudson in
		apparent revenge for her testimony
		against him.  Doctor Hudson did not
		return our phone calls, today.  Our
		sources tell us that if police
		homicide detectives fail to move
		faster in their investigation the
		FBI will be called...

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

	M.J. striding, tight-lipped through the room to her
	workstation where she takes the phone from Ruben...

				M.J.
		Halloran.

	INTERCUT:

				HELEN
		You betrayed me!  Now every
		psychopath in the city knows I'm
		back in business... You lied to me!

				M.J.
		I did not; the Mouth -- that's what
		we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on
		her own.

				HELEN
		Why should I trust you?

				M.J.
		Because I'm all you've got.

	RUBEN HAS BEEN GIVEN NEWS: BIG PROBLEMS.  MEN AND WOMEN ARE
	GETTING UP, PUTTING ON HOLSTERS, ETC., MOVING OUT...

				HELEN
		How could you...

				M.J.
			(out of patience)
		I like the real smart Helen Hudson
		a lot, I'm Goddamned sick and 
		tired of the hysterical little
		girl, Helen.  You asked your way in
		-- I don't forget that.  You've got
		a nickname around here -- "Deep
		Throat" from all the phone calls, I
		wonder if you know that.  Go take a
		xanax, I've got to got to work.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN, her police scanner sounding distant tinny cries in
	the night:  Helen holding the phone, digesting that...

				SCANNER (VARIOUS VOICES)
		987...  Carol Meany, call your
		home?  We have...  don't step on
		me, damn it!  Go to channel 8...
		Code Red -- Homicide at 16th Avenue
		and Horgan, woman dead in car.  Can
		we have homicide?  All units go to
		channel 5.  Leave channel 3 clear
		for homicide... etc.

	EXT. HELEN'S STREET - NIGHT

	A MAN parks a car.  He gets out.  He is dressed entirely in
	black.  Glancing around to be sure he is not observed, the
	MAN moves to cars, banging them hard with his hand until he
	SETS OFF A CAR ALARM.  He trots silently to HELEN'S side of
	the street and merges into the dark side of her building.
	THE ALARM GOES INFURIATINGLY ON.  A light comes on in an
	upstairs window...

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	BURT, the cop on guard, marginally irritated by the car
	alarm, looks up briefly, then returns to his magazine.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RICHMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT

	CAR WHERE A WOMAN HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD.  KLIEG LIGHTS PAINT
	HER FEATURES A BLEAK WHITE ON BLACK.  M.J. and RUBEN work
	the scene along with the CRIME TECH CREW.

	One of the TECH GUYS holds up a bullet.

				TECH GUY
		Pulled this out of the door, it's
		bigger than a .38; it's a .44 or 9
		millimeter.

	CLOSE: M.J. is crawling along the floor, looking at
	everything she can find -- gum wrappers, hobby pins, loose
	change, etc.  She lifts her head and finds the car radio and
	tape player right in her face.

				M.J.
		Was this on?  When you found the
		car was the tape player on or off.

				COP (V.O.)
		It was on, auto-reverse, over and
		over.

	M.J. has rubber gloves on.  She switches on ignition and the
	tape player starts:  ABBA.  A phone rings...

	ON RUBEN standing beside the car; he answers his phone...

				RUBEN
		Yeah?... I can't talk now...
		What?... No.  There's no sexual
		assault, it's a drive-by, a woman
		in a car, it's not him.
			(mouths to M.J.)
		Helen.

	M.J. still pissed at the earlier phone call, turns away,
	dismissively...

				HELEN (V.O.)
		It's a woman shot in a car?

				RUBEN
		Yes.  I have to go...

				HELEN
		She on the passenger side?

				M.J.
			(shouting to be
			 heard)
		Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on
		with his work...

				HELEN
		What's that music.  It's Abba.  I
		can hear it.  It's Abba.

				RUBEN
		What's Abba?

				M.J.
		Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too
		young.

	Dread clouds HELEN'S face.  She is calling up databases,
	screens scrolling across her computer monitor.

				HELEN
		Don't hang up!

				RUBEN
		What?...

				HELEN
		Listen to me.  Is there a gas
		station nearby?

	RUBEN look around, sees a gas station across the street and
	further down the block...

				RUBEN
		Yes.

				HELEN
		Is there a phone booth there?

				RUBEN
		They all have one...

				HELEN
		Go and look for a note.

	RUBEN hands the phone over to M.J.

				RUBEN
		She wants me to check the phone
		booth for a note.

				M.J.
		Helen... excuse me, we...

	ON HELEN'S SCREEN IS THE FACE OF BERKOWITZ... SHE CALLS UP
	ADDITIONAL FRAMES SHOWING SCENES OF HIS CRIMES.

				HELEN
		She was listening to Abba in her
		parked car when she was shot with a
		Bulldog .44.

	M.J. reacts:  the scene of what Helen is saying hits her
	hard.  This is repeating the pattern of yet another
	killer...

				M.J.
		Tony!

	The techie who pulled the bullet out of the door turns...

				M.J.
		Let me see the slug outta the door!

	He pulls a baggie out his pocket and hands it to her...

	RUBEN RUNNING across to the gas station.  He's alone now,
	the blazing lights of the crime scene recede.

	EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	A small annoyed crowd has gathered around the are whose
	alarm is still shrieking.

	INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	BURT finally gets up, goes to window, sees situation,
	decides to go and fix it.

	EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

	M.J. still on phone to HELEN.  She's just got the bullet out
	of the baggie; Tony stands watching.

				M.J.
		What's that siren?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		One of those goddamned car alarms.
		What's going...

				M.J.
		Ruben's gone to look... It's banged
		up but it looks like a .44.  It's
		Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?

				HELEN
		Look in the crowd.  He liked to
		hang around and watch the cops at
		work...

	EXT. SHELL STATION - NIGHT

	Closed.  RUBEN at the phone booth.

	A note lies on the shelf, handwritten in felt-tip pen.  He
	puts on a rubber glove, picks note up by one corner.

	CRIME SCENE:

	RUBEN has taken phone back from M.J.  He is reading the note
	to HELEN.  M.J., agitated, stands by.

				RUBEN
		"Police: let me haunt you with
		these words:  I'll be back."

	M.J. notices that there is writing on the other side of the
	note.  She forces RUBEN'S gloved hand to turn note over.

				RUBEN
		Hold on a minute, Helen...

	By this time M.J. has seen that this part is addressed to
	HELEN.  M.J. takes phone from RUBEN, forcing herself to
	sound casual.

				M.J.
		Helen, Ruben's going to drop by.
		He's got some questions.

	She hangs up, RUBEN is already on his way.  M.J. calls a
	number...

				M.J.
		Answer me!!...

	EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The beeper on Burt's belt is beeping, but his head is under
	the hood of the car where the car alarm is blaring.  He
	can't hear the beeper...  

	BACK TO CRIME SCENE:

	M.J. ends the call, yells to another Detective.

				M.J.
		I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda
		Drive.  Tell them to approach code
		2 and wait for instruction.  Find
		the goddamn officer supposed to be
		on security.  Ruben's on his way.
		He'll go in alone.

	SHE TURNS AND SEES:

	BEHIND YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE THE NIGHT IS FULL OF THRILL
	SEEKERS AND CURIOUS.  WHICH OF THEM MIGHT BE THE KILLER?
	THE GUY IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON
	SUDDENLY BEGINS TO RACE ALONG BEHIND THE ONLOOKERS?  THE MEN
	WHO DUCKS TO TIE HIS SHOE WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER SHOOTS A
	PICTURE?

	INT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The horn blares across the street, (O.S.).  No one notices
	the MAN at HELEN'S door, swiftly fiddling the lock with a
	ring full of burglars' keys and picks.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is putting on makeup (Ruben is coming).  A small but
	alarming noise at the front of the loft.  She listens
	carefully, and moves to the door looking down the hall
	toward the front door.  It is OPEN"  Burt is not there!

	She hesitates a moment, then turns off the lights and
	sprints for the front door, to escape.

	INT. LIVING ROOM

	THE MAN IS PULLING A BALACLAVA UP OVER HIS FACE.  AS HE HEARS
	HER HE STEPS TO THE...

	INSERT: TELEPHONE

	A HAND IN A FINE LEATHER BLACK GLOVE LIFTS THE RECEIVER OFF
	THE HOOK.

	HELEN RUNS DOWN THE HALL AND REACHES THE FRONT DOOR.  SHE
	RUNS RIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL A FEW STEPS BEFORE RECOILING:

	HER POV.  THE WALLS AND FLOOR WEAVING AND CONTRACTING...
	AGORAPHOBIA HAS HIT.

	HELEN FALLS.  SHE SCRAMBLES IN TERROR BACK TO THE "SAFETY"
	OF HER WALL, NOW A CAVE OF DARKNESS.

	SHE FALLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL, GASPING FOR BREATH.

	LIVING ROOM.  THE MAN MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM TOWARD THE
	HALL.

							CUT TO:

	RUBEN:  taking the hills fast.

	THE MAN: STEPS OUT INTO THE HALL.

	HELEN:  SHE HAS RUN BACK THE LENGTH OF THE HALL TO HER
	OFFICE.  SHE IS JUST VANISHING AS THE MAN STEPS TO WHERE HE
	CAN SEE HER.

	THE MAN STARTS TO FOLLOW, NOT FAST, BUT WITH TERRIFYING
	SURENESS...

	THE POLICE SCANNER SUDDENLY COMES UP LOUD.  HE HESITATES.

	HELEN:  HER REMOTE CONTROLS IN HAND SWITCHES ON TV SETS,
	LAMPS, ETC.

	THE MAN:  HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN, TOWARD WHERE HE BELIEVES
	SHE IS.  HE IS PASSING A WINDOW, WHEN THE CURTAINS SUDDENLY
	DRAW, RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  HE PAUSES AGAIN, LOOKS DOWN AND WE
	AND HE/WE SEE THE STREET SCENE: BURT AND NEIGHBORS TRYING TO
	SILENCE THE CAR ALARM.  THEN HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN.

	THE CURTAINS CLOSE.

	HIGH ANGLE OVER THE MAZE OF THE APARTMENT WALLS.  WE CAN SEE
	THE MAN MOVING ALONG THE HALLWAY AGAIN -- TOWARD ANDY'S DEN,
	AND DIRECTLY TOWARD WHERE WE LAST SAW HELEN.

	SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE!  SHE IS
	WRESTLING HERSELF UP OVER THE WALL TOWARD CAMERA, INTO
	ANOTHER ROOM OUT OF HIS PATH.  WE PAN WITH HER AS SHE WIGGLES
	HERSELF OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO
	FURNITURE, MAKING A HUGE NOISE.

	MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION.  HE DECIDES.  LEAPS
	WITH CATLIKE GRACE ONTO A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND FROM THERE
	ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!

	NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE
	GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH
	ANGLE POV.

	HELEN:  SHE CROUCHES IN HIDING.  IN DEEP FOCUS, BEYOND HER,
	AND HIGH ABOVE HER, WE SEE THE MAN SILHOUETTED AS HE BEGINS
	TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON
	BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.

	HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.
	INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN.  HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED
	COVERS.

	THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.

	SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE
	ADJACENT ROOM.  THE MAN'S FIGURE DOESN'T EVEN SLOW, HE'S
	ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT:  HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING
	ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.

	SHE HITS THE REMOTE:  THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT
	COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

	CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH
	ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE

	RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the
	building.

	BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a
	time.

	HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND
	TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S
	FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY
	BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

	LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE
	BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with
	a knife-scarred face.

				MAN
		I can explain!

				RUBEN
		The fuck you can!
			(shouts)
		Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

	Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

				RUBEN
		Did this animal touch you?

	She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
	RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

				RUBEN
		Turn on a light and call in the
		unit.  NOW!

	BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

				MAN
		No gun!

				RUBEN
		Bullshit's gonna get your balls
		stomped on!  What's your name?

				MAN
		Chow.  Conrad Chow.

	The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry
	kick to the man's side.

				MAN
		Swear to God!  Conrad Chow.  Never
		carry a gun.

				BURT
		Backup's here...

				RUBEN
			(to Burt)
		Then you get your ass outta here, I
		don't wanta see you again...

				CONRAD
		I brought a present for the lady,
		there.  I'm looking for her, to give
		her the present...

				RUBEN
		You break into her apartment to
		deliver a gift?  Where is it?

				CONRAD
		The door was open, swear to God,
		I'm just looking for her when you
		come charging up the stairs...

				RUBEN
		Where is it?

				CONRAD
		I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the
		lady's pillow...

	Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow... 
	scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns
	to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the
	book up like a question.

				CONRAD
		Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
		book, he wanted the lady to have
		it.  They won't let him send it to
		her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
		to deliver it in person, he says,
		put it on her pillow.  It has all
		about how he tried to kill her.

				RUBEN
		He told you she was loaded, any-
		thing you could steal you could
		keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself
		a return ticket to Quentin,
		breaking and entering.

				CONRAD
		The door was already open...

				RUBEN
		We know...
			(to a cop)
		Send the book to evidence...

				CONRAD
		She's supposed to have it.

				RUBEN
		She don't want it.

	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
	chest.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's
		nothing.  A burglar.

	She sits there, says nothing.

				RUBEN (V.O.)
		Open the door.  Please.

				HELEN
		Why don't you shoot off the lock?

	She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
	she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
	her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
	washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

				HELEN
		He was in my apartment!

				RUBEN
		I know, baby.  I know.

	Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
	she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
	the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
	her.

				RUBEN
		It's okay... you're safe with me!

	He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
	around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
	her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

				RUBEN
		When I was a little kid, and I'd be
		in a state, my father would hold me
		on his lap, until all the fight
		would go out of me...

	She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

				HELEN
		You think you're my Daddy?

	There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
	RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
	she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
	smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
	Been agreed upon.

				RUBEN
		Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

	He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

				RUBEN
		You know how to use this?

				HELEN
		They taught me at the FBI.  I was
		very good at it.  It scared me... I
		liked it.

				RUBEN
		You take it, hang on to it, it'll
		make you feel safer.  Stay put.

				HELEN
		What else?

	He goes.

	A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY
	NUMBERS" BY THE POLICE...

		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art..."

	HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE
	IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
	HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

	THE SONG CONTINUES...

							CUT TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical
	cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
	doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
	identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
	in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
	couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

	INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

	As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
	the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
	a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
	continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
	the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
	pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
	cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
	belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
	stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

	QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
	gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
	a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

	M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
	addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more
	FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.
	THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A
	projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
	phone booth.

		Dr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art.
		Well, if you have a taste for this experience
		You're flushed with your very first success
		Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
		Before your conscience bothers you much less.
		Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
		In history's great dark hall of fame
		All of our greatest killers were industrious
		At least the ones that we all know by name."

	SAKS speaks...

				SAKS
		Hello.  I am (research title)
		Meryhew Saks.  The song is called
		"Murder By Numbers."  The
		performers are a group called The
		Police.  Adam here...
                ... from Behavioral Science is
		working out exactly what this
		perpetrator is trying to telegraph
		in the note.  This is an extremely
		complex case, and we have a lot of
		fancy theories floating around.
		We're not ruling out the possib-
		ility of three Copycat serial
		killers.  We have Quantico working
		on graphology, the Washington lap
		is cloning DNA from the secretor.
		It's our feeling that the best lead
		we have is the two sperm samples in
		one of the victims.  We have a team
		sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want
		to say a few word to you local
		people.  Your Commissioner asked
		for our assistance.  The Bureau
		does not send us in on these cases
		to lord it over the local police.
		We couldn't catch up on what you
		people know if we had a year.  We
		have nation-wide resources and hard
		state of the art forensic science;
		you have the local savvy.  Together
		we can be unbeatable.  Which one is
		Inspector Halloran?

				M.J.
		Over here.

	SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
	TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

				SAKS
		We don't see too many lady homicide
		detectives.  You have my respect.
		Have you discussed the note with
		Dr. Hudson?

				M.J.
		Someone broke into her place last
		night.  It wasn't connected to our
		case, but it shook her up pretty
		bad so I haven't...

	QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

				SAKS
		I was just about to advise the
		Inspector here not to show Dr.
		Hudson the note.

				M.J.
		Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
		pattern develop...

				SAKS
			(riding over her)
		We know Helen.  She's not exactly a
		credible collaborator.  Especially
		late in the day...

				M.J.
		She takes tranquilizers her doctor
		prescribes.

				SAKS
		Who prescribes the brandy?

	M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

				M.J.
		How come you're so up on Dr.
		Hudson?

				SAKS
		She is a writer, writing best
		selling books about serial killing.
		Giving lectures she's well-paid
		for.  Her interests are not the
		interests of law enforcement.

				M.J.
		Okay.

				SAKS
		We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
		phone.  I know you won't mention
		it.

	So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has
	arrived, addresses SAKS.

				QUINN
		Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word
		with my officer...

	He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

				QUINN
		M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
		Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing
		in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
		night and Jack's kid got hit by a
		car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

				M.J.
		What does this mean?  Now we got
		the FBI, my team is expendable?
		I'm working my ass off, is anybody
		listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He
		and Nikko don't even get on
		together...

				QUINN
		Teach both of them a lesson in
		cooperation and self-discipline.

				M.J.
		If this is a first step in kicking
		me off the case, just tell me, to
		my face, sir, don't waste time
		being diplomatic.

				QUINN
		Just, I need results.  And -- I am
		short-handed.  Who else am I gonna
		give him?

				M.J.
			(looking at Saks)
		Give him thatpompous son of a
		bitch.

	She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi
	meets her...

				GIGI
		Lab called.  They got a result on
		the drug test you requested...?

	It takes a moment to remember what it was...

				GIGI
		They said it was Windex?

	If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's
	gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited
	dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

	HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that
	M.J. has just given her.

				HELEN
		..."I'll be back..."

	As she looks at the back of the note... she looks up into
	M.J.'S face.

				M.J.
		Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't
		lose your head."

	Helen puts down the note.  She is holding herself together
	by main will power... doesn't want to face that note...

				HELEN
		They put  Merry Saks on it?!

				M.J.
		He said to send you his regards and 
		to tell you that the Bureau holds
		you in the highest esteem.

				HELEN
		What I can't believe is that in an
		earlier life I slept with him!
		Christ!  Any God that loved his
		people would give women a rewind on
		their life and an erase button.
			(looks at M.J.)
		Just give me a minute here.  The
		letter is addressed to me...
			(she's breathing
			 fast, controls it)
		You don't feel fear, do you?
		You're young.  You feel like you'll
		live forever.  How wonderful.

				M.J.
		I put my ass on the line, giving
		you that.

				HELEN
		They weren't going to show it to
		me?!  The arrogance!  It's my life!

				M.J.
		It's also the major piece of
		evidence, and it makes you a key
		part of his plan.  You can't run
		away from it anymore.
			(beat)
		Look at the order he's doing
	them... He did three as the Boston
		Strangler just to tell us a copycat
		serial killer was at work.  Then he
		did one like the Hillside Strang-
		ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.
		To lead us on -- to where and what
		end?  And he's doing more than that
		-- he's imitating each killer's
		method as closely as he can -- in
		details.  Injecting Windex.  Using
		.44.  Playing Abba.

				HELEN
		It's not chronological: Son of Sam
		was before Hillside.

	She begins to read.

				M.J.
		It's clear he thinks he knows me.
		He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't
		lose your head.'  Is that a threat?
		Does he want to cut off my head?
		Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?
		Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I
		think Rivkind did.

	She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out.  She
	closes her eyes for a moment.  We begin to see certain
	filtered images.  As they come, we INTERCUT them.

				HELEN
		He attacks what he feels he can't
		have.  What he feels excluded
		from...

	EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

	Lush, pastoral green.  We see PETER sitting by himself.  He
	wears a WHITE LAB COAT, like one we saw hanging in his
	basement.

	HIS POV:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
	studying together, picnicking.  Women sunbathe, their straps
	pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to
	expose their midriffs.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		'First you make a stone of your
		heart.'... Oh yes!  He doesn't
		suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our
		turn.

	One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then
	takes her top off entirely.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Kemper said in order to have the
		experience he wanted with them, he
		needed to evict them from their
		bodies.  By making the body a
		completely passive object, he
		releases himself from passivity.

	CLOSE:  HELEN, DEEP IN THOUGHT...

				HELEN
		But the relief he feels is only
		temporary.  '...Before your
		conscience bothers you much
		less...'  But the tension always
		comes back.
			(she now picks out
			 the words:)
		'You can join the ranks of the
		illustrious...'  He wants to be
		like them.  The best.  To become
		the best.  But, he has his own
		desires, his own compulsions apart
		from theirs.'  His own horrors...

							CUT TO:

	FLASHBACK: PETER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

	An incremental flash of a SMALL BOY standing by his bed
	which he has wet.  His pajamas are soaked.  His powerful
	MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Some horrors that are all his
		own...

	The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where
	firewood and stacked papers are kept.  The door is slammed
	hard.  He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of
	matches, lights one.  Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile
	of newspapers.  They start to burn.  We see, but do not,
	hear, his screams for help.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		He needs to prove they don't
		control him, that he's the one in
		control.  But the feeling of power
		never lasts.  He can control his
		victims, but he can't control
		anything else... his place in the
		world.  He want s to be recognized.
		He puts messages in my computer; he
		sends me a letter...

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	She picks out the lines... "then you must try a twosome or a
	threesome."

				HELEN
		Of course he wants to do a
		threesome!  Only Bundy did three in
		one day.  Is Bundy next?  But Bundy
		should be last... the grand finale.
		What about Kemper and Ramirez?
		Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?  Rivkind?
		Who else is on his list?  In what
		order?

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	PETER in his car.  Ahead, he see TWO GIRLS at a bus stop.
	We see PETER take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal
	it under his right thigh.  The TWO GIRLS are wearing
	backpacks.  'FESTIVAL OF LOVE' stickers decorate the bags.
	PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says
	something.  They giggle, shake their heads.  He laughs,
	holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a 'Not
	guilty!' gesture, then makes a peace sign.  The girls giggle
	again, but do not get in.

	PETER drives off.

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

				HELEN
		'...great dark hall of fame... all
		our greatest killers...'  His
		greatest heroes?  He wants to be
		famous.  When they're caught and
		people like me write about them, we
		give them a kind of immortality.
		They get thousands of letters.
		Ramirez kills eight women and gets
		a hundred marriage proposals a
		month.  They're like film stars.

				M.J.
		They get fan letters...

	INT. PRISON - DAY WARDEN FELIX MENDOZA IN HIS OFFICE

				FELIX
		We keep records of any threatening
		or illegal correspondence, like
		relatives of victims who might want
		to send the condemned man some
		strychnine cookies.  So it's only a
		partial list, but you're still
		looking at about forty pages...

	MONTAGE OF PICTURE AND SOUND:  WE BEGIN TO SEE MOVING LISTS
	OF NAMES -- LIKE SCHINDLER'S LIST -- SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE
	SHORT SNIPPETS OF SCENES... A WATERFALL OF NAMES...

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE

	INSERT FAX MACHINE:  LISTS OF NAMES BEING EXCRETED.

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Would you fax those pages to me?

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

	M.J. on the phone.  On the desk in front of her, is a list
	of killers, complementary to HELEN'S.

				M.J.
		Thank you for your help, Warden
		Hillyer.  As soon as you can.

	She hangs up as GIGI puts a long fax sheet of names on
	M.J's desk.

				GIGI
		Hot off the fax.  Mr. Rivkind's
		fans.

	M.J. doesn't look at the Rivkind list, just crosses his name
	off the killer list and picks up the phone, dials, waits.

	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	CLOSE:  FAX OF A LIST OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES IS SCANNED BY A

	THE COMPUTER SCREEN SCROLLS NAMES FASTER AND FASTER, EVERY

		Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.

				HELEN (O.S.)
		You've got a date right here, Andy.
		This has got to...

	WE NOW SEE ANDY is feeding the scanner, he has a thick sheaf
	of faxed lists...

				ANDY
		It's almost six.  And guess what?
		Hall likes me bathed and shaved.

		Stop acting like a silly little

	His eyebrows arch, but his smile stays in place.

	M.J. is entering at front door, let in by a new Guard FRED.

				HELEN (O.S.)
		It's not a real name: it's the name
		of a mass murderer in Germany in
		the 1930s.  They called him the
		Monster of Dusseldorf.

	M.J. is turning into the Office; she carries a portfolio of
	lists of her own.

				HELEN
		Let's speed up the game plan...
		call all the living serials to ask
		if they've had contact with a Peter
		Kurten.  We could use some help on
		the phones...

				M.J.
		They're not talking to me.  Saks
		looks right through me.  I ask him
		for some bodies, for the phones --
		he's so encouraging: "you make that
		your little job."  Condescending
		bastard.
			(careful)
		Helen, on your lists to call is San

		Sergeant Halloran is it?  I've

		Daryll Lee claims he has
		information about Kurten, but
		he'll only talk to Dr. Hudson
		personally.  Nobody else.  The
		creep's been studying his
		amendments.  My guess is he
		doesn't have zip.  Just
		angling for a chance to ask if
		her bra size is still the

				M.J.
		Thanks, Warden.

	HELEN, M.J.  They are waiting, Helen tense, smoking,

				M.J.
		Do those things really help?

	Like she really wished they might, so she could have one.
	Helen looks at her cigarette as though she'd never seen one
	before... grinds it out...

		Not a damn bit...

	And unconsciously lights another during following...

	INT.  PENITENTIARY INTERVIEW ROOM

	DARYLL LEE CULLUM is on the phone, a Warden is attendance,
	but not on the phone line.  On this rare contact with the
	outside world HE IS MANIC...

				DARYLL LEE
		Hey, Doc!  How you doing?

	She turns on speakerphone.

				HELEN
		Hello, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		You read my book which as you know,
		hit the stands a couple of weeks
		ago.  You read it yet.

				HELEN
		What book?

				DARYLL
			(indignant)
		I sent it by private courier, he
		didn't give it to you?  That son of
		a gun...!

	Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

				HELEN
		I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

				DARYLL
		Bet you never figured I'd follow in
		your footsteps.  It's real well-
		written.  You should read it --
		you're in it.

				HELEN
		I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and
		talk to you about it after I've
		read it.  Right now I have a
		question... Peter Kurten.

				DARYLL
		Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I
		told that son I'd send him what he
		wanted if he leave you alone.

				HELEN
		Ah ha.  What did he want?

				DARYLL
		Something personal.  Is he bothering
		you?

				HELEN
		I don't know.  I'd like to know
		where he is.

				DARYLL
		Listen, you want my advice?  Steer
		clear.  He's writing me he's gonna
		finish 'my unfinished symphony.'
		He's gonna give me $550 for some of
		my cum, he says he's in a position
		to see that I will be immortal if
		he has some of my spunk.  I'm
		offended.  Right away I smell
		freak.  Writin' about him and me
		and you bein' joined and he's gonna
		finish my symphony?  I didn't care
		for his drift.  I sent some liquid
		soap in a sandwich baggie with a
		message from Jesus to mend his
		ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And
		what's funny is, now I don't mind
		bein' inside.  If I was out, even
		Born Again, I'd probably get
		restless again.  It's maybe better
		I stay here, what do you think?

				HELEN
		I think whatever is best for you,
		Daryll.  And maybe you're right,
		that's the place.

				DARYLL
		You come and visit.

				HELEN
		Where did you send the message to
		Peter Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!
		That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to
		Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in
		return for getting my book to you.

	At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

				HELEN
		How was Conrad supposed to find
		Kurten?

				DARYLL
		Conrad has the phone number.
		Conrad, where is he?

				HELEN
			(from M.J.'s pantomime)
		In jail.

				DARYLL
		That Klutz.  They send him back
		here, I'll kick his ass good.

				DARYLL LEE
		Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come
		see me, talk to me.  I think about
		you, worry about you all the time.
		I am so glad Jesus didn't let me
		kill you.  You know -- you're
		blessed by Jesus.  That's why you
		need to come talk to me, because
		Jesus kept you alive for a reason,
		and I was his sacred instrument...
		In the moment Satan was in my heart
		raising my hand to kill you, Jesus
		took my hand to spare you.  I am
		both death and life to you...

	INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and
	NIKKO AND RUBEN and a dozen other cops are booking a group
	of Chinese gangsters of all ages, and a group of frightened
	and confused Chinese illegal aliens.  TOTAL UPROAR.

	THROUGH IT, WE MOVE WITH M.J.  SHE PASSES RUBEN WHO IS
	GRABBING A CHINESE KID STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING, OUT OF A
	LINE OF SUSPECTS... HE ASIDES:

				M.J.
		I brought back a gin-seng popper
		for you.  Guaranteed all-night
		orgasms.

				M.J.
		Save it for Helen.

				RUBEN
			(enough already!)
		Wait a minute, wait a goddamn
		minute...

	He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE...

				RUBEN
		The woman was in shock.  She was
		totally out on ranks.  I stayed
		because I didn't want her to wake
		up alone in a place where she'd
		just been under attack.
			(to the Kid who is
			 restless)
		Stop that, you son of a bitch!
			(back to her)
		The place wasn't secure.  I was
		doing my goddamn job!  And, for the
		second time, I slept in her living
		room.

				M.J.
		Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't
		have the face for it.  I need you
		to help interrogate the burglar in
		Hudson's place...

				RUBEN
		Talk to Nikko...!

	SHE MOVES ON TO FIND NIKKO

	NIKKO sites at his desk, processing the papers for the sullen
	YOUNG THUG who is handcuffed to a chain next to NIKKO'S
	desk.  Nikko  unholsters his gun... he shoves it into his
	desk drawer...

				NIKKO
		You speak English?
			(Chinese)
		You need an interpreter?

	QUINN, walking past the ILLEGALS, speaks to GIGI.

				QUINN
		I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted
		just the bastards dumping them in
		the harbor.  What's keeping those
		bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in
		here...

	M.J. STANDS OVER NIKKO

				M.J.
		I gotta have Ruben, and a...

	HARROWING SCREAM!!!  ILLEGAL WOMAN IS SCREAMING --
	PANDEMONIUM AMONG THE DETAINEES.  COPS RUSH TO CONTROL THE
	PROBLEM.

				NIKKO
		Outta your mind?  Look at this...

				M.J.
			(to Quinn)
		Lieutenant...?

	Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally
	bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild
	kid.

	NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the
	drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the
	kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

				M.J.
		The prowler in Hudson's apartment
		turns out to have a meeting with a
		suspect...

				QUINN
			(amazed)
		You got a suspect...

	THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.

				QUINN
		How'd you get in on the deal?

				M.J.
		I'm gonna drop charges on the
		break-and-enter at Hudson's...

				QUINN
		You have no authority to make a
		deal like that.  That' s for the
		D.A...

				M.J.
		Or the F.B.I.?

				QUINN
		Saks.  If he knew you did that!
		They're all asking me, 'what is she
		doing,' as it is.

				M.J.
		Give me Ruben back...

				QUINN
		Nikko?

				NIKKO
		We get through this shit, let 'em
		all go.

	NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the
	door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP
	US HERE:  8:47)

				M.J.
		I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll
		be in the jail when you wind this
		up...

				RUBEN
		I gotta get something to eat, I
		haven't eaten all day.

	M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and
	commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair
	and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
	Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
	teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

	RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
	KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
	the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
	can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where
	he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,
	MAC rises.

				MAC
		Here... I'm finished...

				RUBEN
			(to Kid)
		I'm going to the coffee machine.
		Hold the fort.

	He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the
	room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get
	free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

	CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer
	behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the
	KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed
	against the desk.

				RUBEN
		Behave.  You refuse my hospitality,
		I'm putting you to bed.

	He pushes the coffee toward the Kid, who WHIPS NIKKO'S GUN
	OUT FROM UNDER THE DESK, where it was hidden, and lays it up
	under Ruben's ear.  KID moves behind RUBEN and puts a skinny
	arm around RUBEN'S neck, pulling him upright.  RUBEN still
	clutching the doughnut box.  It takes a moment for the
	others to SEE.  Then the room is absolutely motionless.

				NIKKO
		Take it easy, Kid.  Nobody's gonna

	The KID doesn't see her, yet, as he is backing away from the

		Hey, you...

	The KID turns, sees her, exposing his shoulder to her... SHE
	FIRES AND HITS THE KID.

	RUBEN GOES FOR HIS OWN GUN, BUT THE KID'S GUN THAT FELL FROM

	BEFORE RUBEN HAS HIS GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF HIS HOLSTER.  THE
	KID SHOOTS RUBEN IN THE THROAT AT AN ANGLE THAT TAKES THE
	BULLET STRAIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN.

	THEN THE KID THROWS THE GUN AWAY, AND STANDS, HIS HANDS UP

	carried out of the room.  Her hand holds the doughnut box.

	Finally, M.J. blinks, her head turns as if she can't imagine
	what to do, where to go.  Then, suddenly conscious of the
	doughnut box, she clutches it tight against her chest.

		So I'm maybe gonna lose three good

	will them away.  She brushes at them angrily...

		You're exhausted.  Let me get you a

		Where's the john?  Let me clean up

	Helen has stepped to her brandy decanter; M.J., too dejected
	to move, sits, staring now at the only thing to stare at: the
	computer screen.

				HELEN (O.S.)
		Who's the married man?

				M.J.
		What does it matter?  This guy, you
		checked your course records, who

	Helen returns with the brandy.  M.J. holds it, doesn't drink,
	just stares at the computer screen, emotionally dead...

				HELEN
		The University computer is down for

		Look.  There's the order:  you
		wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi &
		Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's
		going to be Dahmer next.  Which
		means he'll kill a man.

	With an effort of will M.J. moves to the phone, putting the

		Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...

				RADIO NEWS
		...that I resent the tone of the
		Police and their attitude?  That
		this is just some weird queer
		event, just because they couldn't
		stop this guy until he did himself,
		if you even believe that...

	M.J. turns off the radio... when light turns green,
	instead of moving ahead, she just sits for a moment.  Then,
	furious with HELEN, with everything, she swears and wheels
	the car into a tight illegal u-turn.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. NIGHT BERKELEY CAMPUS - NIGHT

	It is extra time, which means party time or those who've
	finished and solitary and group study time for the rest.
	And there are celebrants of the Festival of Love, who were
	being born about the time of the original event.  TRACKING
	SHOT TO ESTABLISH THIS SCENE, MOVING, SEARCHING ALONG THE
	AVENUES, PASSING KNOTS OF STUDENTS AND PARTY-GOES... WE
	HAVE SEEN A PEACEFUL CAMPUS, QUIETLY CELEBRATING.  AND WE
	HAVE DRAWN UP BEFORE CHI OMEGA.  THERE IS NO PLACE TO PARK.
	M.J., WHOSE POV THIS HAS BEEN LOOKS AT HER WATCH.
	DECIDES: FUCK IT, THIS IS CRAZY AND IS ABOUT TO DRIVE AWAY,
	SHIFTING INTO GEAR WHEN SHE SPOTS:

	POV.  A GOLD COLORED VW BUG

	It is parked under a tree some distance across a parking lot
	jammed with student cars.  It is partly in shadow, so she
	could easily have missed it.  She jumps out of the car and
	moves fast up the steps through students, drinking, kissing,
	studying, arguing...

	INT. CHI OMEGA - NIGHT

	MAIN MEETING ROOM.  Full of people milling about.  Music is
	playing.  SEES THE BACK OF A TALL MAN ON CRUTCHES TALKING TO
	A COED.  HE HAS A LOAD OF BOOKS SHE TAKES FROM HIM; SHE IS
	LAUGHING.  M.J. moving fast toward them, she runs into a
	girl, spilling the girls' drink on her blouse...

				GIRL
		Goddamn it!  This is brand new!
		Where're you going?

	As M.J. continues to move the Girl grabs her...

				GIRL
		No, you don't spill all over
		somebody and just walk away, you
		damn well pay the cleaning bill...

				M.J.
		Police business -- take your heads
		off.

				GIRL
		Bullshit!

	M.J. holds up the badge...

				M.J.
		Don't make me pull the gun...

	She jerks away, almost knocking the Girl down.  The Girl is
	yelling, beginning to attract attention.  As M.J. turns back
	to SEE.

	PETER AND THE COED are just moving off, the Coed holding his
	books, he hobbling on the crutches.  M.J. runs through the
	crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is
	getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from
	sight behind a wall, PETER looks around, straight at M.J..

	IT ISN'T PETER AT ALL.

	M.J. LOOKING AROUND, MOVES TO STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR...

	M.J. EMERGING FROM STAIRS INTO THE CORRIDOR -- SHE RUNS DOWN
	THIS CORRIDOR OF ROOMS, PUSHING OPEN ANY THAT ARE SHUT.

	A SCARED COUPLE MAKING LOVE CONFRONT HER GUN.  SHE
	REHOLSTERS IT AND RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY...

	OVER THE PARTY NOISE AND MUSIC WE HEAR A SCREAM.  M.J. RACES
	DOWN CORRIDORS, TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE.  ANOTHER SCREAM.
	IT SEEMS TO COME FROM BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.  M.J. KICKS IT
	OPEN, BURSTING IN:

	INT. ROOM

	A BUNCH OF STONED STUDENTS PASSING A JOINT: ON A TV PLAYER
	IS THE IMAGE OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN AN EARLY SHOCKER: THEY
	ARE PLAYING AT WHO CAN OUT-SCREAM JAMIE LEE CURTIS.

	WHEN JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAMS --

	THEY ALL SCREAM BACK!  AND BURST INTO HOWLS OF LAUGHTER.  THE
	SIGHT OF M.J. WITH HER GUN OUT ONLY MAKES THEM HOWL LOUDER.

				STUDENT
		Swallow the joint!  It's Barney
		Phyfe -- in drag!

	THEN ALTOGETHER THEY SCREAM AT HER!  AND HOWL WITH LAUGHTER.

	THE HALL. 

	M.J. walks out of the room and down the corridor.

	EXT. CHI OMEGA FRONT STEPS

	SHE LOOKS OUT ACROSS THE PARKING LOT: THE GOLD VW BUG IS 
	GONE.

	SHE WALKS TO HER CAR, RELIEVED.  THE WHOLE THING SEEMS LIKE
	A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH SHE HAS NOW AWAKENED.

	INT. M.J'S CAR

	AS SHE OPENS THE DOOR, REACHES IN AND GRABS HER PHONE.  SHE
	ACTIVATES PHONE, WHEN SHE IS BLINDSIDED BY PETER WHO SLAMS
	HER INTO THE CAR, FACE DOWN ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT.  HE 
	DISARMS HER, TWISTS HER INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT...

	THERE ARE STUDENTS AT SOME DISTANCE, BUT SHE CAN'T MAKE
	HERSELF BE HEARD.  SHE IS GROGGY FROM THE BLOW SHE'S TAKEN.
	HE HANDCUFFS HER TO THE CAR, FIND HER KEYS, AND BEGINS TO
	DRIVE AWAY... PETER'S HAIR IS NOW BRIGHT RED -- LIKE DARYLL
	LEE CULLUM'S.

								CUT TO:

	INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Helen lies wide awake in the dark.  PHONE RINGS.

	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

	INSERT: TAPE RECORDER ATTACHED TO PHONE.  IT STARTS TO TURN.
	AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM AN FBI DETECTIVE IS POURING HIMSELF
	SOME COFFEE.  HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WE HEAR:

				HELEN (V.O.)
			(thinking it's M.J.)
		Where are you?

				PETER (V.O.)
		Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter
		Foley -- how do you grade me now,
		Doctor?

	HELEN ON PHONE

				HELEN
			(beat)
		Who was the man in the basement?

				PETER
		You like that action?  Didn't that
		cop on TV look solemn?  The guy in
		the basement doesn't matter,
		anyway, just another lonely heart.

				HELEN
		Where are you, Peter?

				PETER
		You thought I was going to do Ted
		Bundy next, so you sent your
		partner...

	Helen gasps with the implications of that...

				PETER
		What was that?  What am I hearing?
		The sound of an epiphany, a sudden
		blinding insight?

				HELEN
		It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?

				PETER
		Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You
		have to come to me.

				HELEN
		You know I can't do that.

				PETER
		Oh, I think you will.

	Peter rips duct tape off M.J.'s mouth...

				M.J.
			(yelling)
		Call the police!  Now!  Call Qui...

	Peter punches M.J. who is handculled in her car; they are
	parked in front of the Lecture Hall.

				HELEN
		For God's sake Peter, leave her out
		of it.  You don't want her, you
		want me.

				PETER
		I need her; she's a cop.  I have to
		kill a cop, and then...

				HELEN
		You've been perfect.  Don't spoil
		the symmetry -- you have to have a
		male cop.

				PETER
		I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's
		the important thing.  Cop-ness, not
		sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but
		it'll be good.

				M.J.
			(yells)
		Call Quinn and Saks.

				PETER
		I'm tired.  I want it to end
		tonight, don't you?

				HELEN
		Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now.
		Let her go.  I'll come -- just let
		her go.  She's not important.

				PETER
		You know where.

				HELEN
		Where it began -- McCluskey
		Auditorium.

	He hangs up.

	INSERT: TAPE MONITOR.  WE HEAR HELEN HANGING UP.  A SMALL
	COMPUTER CHIP VOICE IS HEARD.  THE FBI MAN IS MEASURING
	SUGAR INTO HIS COFFEE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM.  HE CAN'T
	HEAR:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Time Zero-hundred and twenty -- two
		minutes and sixteen seconds June

	BATHROOM DRAWER

	It is pulled open: metallic sounds of  bullets rolling on the
	wooden drawer: her hand bats away the usual bathroom drawer
	garbage and pull Ruben's gun out; HER TREMBLING FINGERS
	RELOAD IT.

	EXT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALL - NIGHT

	Helen wearing loose coat, jeans and sneakers opens the door.
	FRED snaps out of a sound sleep.

				HELEN
		It's all over, Fred.  They got the
		guy.  You go home to your own bed
		now.

				FRED
		I got to have that from my
		superior.  One guy fired off this
		job already.

				HELEN
		Call in.  Use my phone.  They'll
		tell you -- it's all over.

	FRED GOES.  HELEN STEPS RESOLUTELY INTO THE HALL, FOR
	REASSURANCE BRACES HERSELF WITH A HAND ON THE WALL.

	THE HALLWAY (HER POV).  IT SEEMS MILES LONG.  SOUND: HER
	FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO
	LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...

	HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR.  BRIDGES BURNED.  TURNS BACK.

	HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND
	PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL.  THEN HER HAND
	MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.

	HER POV.  THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL.  MOVING SHOT PICKS UP
	SPEED...

	HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.

	HELEN MOVES WITH MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE: HER AGORAPHOBIA
	IS GONE... HER HAND DROPS TO HER SIDE...

	EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT

	The door opens and Helen appears in it.  She confronts the
	street and the night... One more threshold to cross...

	STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND
	IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME.  The night seems to roar; the
	lights blur and flare.  A truck comes past too fast, 
	stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.

	HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

	INT. CAR as she slides into the driver's seat, slamming the
	door and locking it.  She drives off into the night.

	EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM -  NIGHT

	A broad view through shadowy trees shows it's lighted
	facade.  Parked in front of is M.J.'s car.  SUDDENLY FROM
	BEHIND THE TREES, SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT, BLOCKING THE WAY!

	REVERSE:  HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US.
	SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN
	FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET
	FLAGGING HER DOWN --

	SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE
	DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

				SAKS
		Ma'am, please get out of your
		vehicle...

				HELEN
		Merry, how... oh, Christ, of
		course, you had my phone tapped.

				SAKS
		Just get out of your vehicle...

				HELEN
		He's got Sergeant Halloran in
		there.  He'll kill her the minute
		he sees or hears your people...

				SAKS
		You've been very useful, Doctor, we
		appreciate all you've done, and now
		the professional will take over...

				HELEN
		He wants me, he doesn't care about
		her.  Let me...

	SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE
	DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE
	GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND
	FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS
	TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

	SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
	AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
	HIM FROM SHOOTING.

	NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
	street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
	brakes behind M.J.'s car.

	CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
	She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
	make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
	the wide stairs...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,
	listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
	windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
	without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
	returns...

	Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
	She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
	building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
	Peter somewhere in the room?

	She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
	auditorium...

	CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

	THEN:

	PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE
	VISION SNAPS.

	HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
	A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
	CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
	THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE
	WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
	SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
	DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE
	SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.

	REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
	BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE
	FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
	HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,
	BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
	TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
	AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO
	HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
	COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.

	HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!

	CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT
	ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
	THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

	AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,
	BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT
	DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE
	BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.
	IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT
	ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.

	SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

	EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT

	THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.

				SWAT
		Oh, man?!  Let us in there.

				SAKS
		Go.  Go.  Go!

	Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
	toward the Auditorium...

	INT. LADIES' ROOM

	HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE
	SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:

	M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
	IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE
	FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

	HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
	OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
	REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.

				PETER
		You cheated!  You said you'd come
		die with me.

	WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
	HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
	HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
	OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
	WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

	EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
	AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;
	THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING
	THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

	PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
	SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE
	TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
	TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP
	AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.

				PETER
		Listen to them!  We'll be on all
		three channels.

				HELEN
		Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

				PETER
		No.  Not yet.

				HELEN
		Do it.  If that's what all this
		carnage is about, then do it.  Have
		enough guts to do it.

				PETER
		Don't talk to me about courage.  I
		know death, what it's like to kill.
		You're not a killer -- you watched
		Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
		didn't make a peep, because you
		were paralyzed with fear.  You
		chocked.  I know something else about
		you.

	Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
	pill into his mouth and swallows...

				PETER
		You want one?  No?  There was
		something in you that was
		fascinated, that wanted to see what
	it was like for a man to die.
		Everybody feels it.  Like every
		person who slows to see a bad
		accident, or runs to see a fire.
		That's true.  I see it in you...
		you're the same as me.

	THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.

				PETER
		Oh, no.

	HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS
	HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.

	FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,
	INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
	DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

	He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair
	facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

				PETER
		We'll keep talking.  Until they get
		here.  Then...
			(smiles)

				HELEN
		I have no life anymore.  I ruined
		your life, make me pay for it.

				PETER
		Why did you do that?  Didn't you
		have any idea how hard it was for
		me, to get that far?  I worshipped
		you.  You inspired me.  I thought
		you could understand me the way you
		understood the others.  I knew that
		about you -- the ones you admired
		were the great murderers; they
		fascinated you.

				HELEN
		That's not who I admire -- I admire
		people who are good at what they
		do, great artists, writers,
		thinkers...

				PETER
		I don't have the talent for any of
		those things.  All I have a talent
		for is death.  And I am one of a
		kind.  What do you think of your
		student now?  I have made you
		famous, I am your creation and your
		monument.

	BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
	VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES
	BUT PETER DOES NOT.

				HELEN
		If you let me, I can make you more
		famous than any of them.

				PETER
		Oh, please.  I know what's coming,
		now.  "Let me help you..."

				HELEN
		Do anything you want to me.  I give
		myself to you.  Only put the knife
		down.  Isn't this what you always
		wanted?  I know it's what we all
		want, to love and to loved.  I
		could love you.  You could work
		together in some safe place, learn
		to really understand you, help you,
		give you some peace of mind, some
		happiness...

				PETER
		Back in the driver's seat again,
		Doctor?  That old dream -- study us
		to see what makes us sick.  So you
		can find a cure -- they'd name it
		after you?  Death is the only cure
		for people like me.

	He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
	moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

	HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
	AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
	TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
	THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.

	HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM
	BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT
	HER...

	BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
	SHOT.

	HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS
	M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
	SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.

				HELEN
		Do it.  For God's sake, now...

	M.J. FIRES.

	PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,
	SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.

				PETER
			(surprised, like a
			 child)
		You hurt me!

	M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST
	GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:

	THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
	EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.

	THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED
	SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
	GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
	SHADOWS.

	OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...

				M.J. & HELEN
		No!!

	PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN
	SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...

	A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
	TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.

	SWAT TEAM

	LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.

	PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
	SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
	BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

				M.J.
		Jesus that hurts.  You think the
		rib is busted?

				PARAMEDIC
		That looks like just a bad bruise.
		I'll tape it up if you want to...

				M.J.
		I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
		instead, how about a lot of number
		six?

	The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around
	them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on
	her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

				M.J.
			(it hurts)
		Oh, God.

	SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
	LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
	and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she
	misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
	resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of
	officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
	AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.

				QUINN
		I'll take it, kid.  You take two
		weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a
		second thinking about that shitbag.
		Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

	He nods to Helen...

				QUINN (cont'd)
		Get the civilians outta here.

				M.J.
		She's in no shape to give her
		statement tonight...

				QUINN
		No, she can come in tomorrow...
		gonna want to know a lot of
		things...

	B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
	HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
	and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past
	them, as...

				HELEN
		The only one who could tell you
		what you really need to know is
		dead.

				QUINN
		Yeah, it's a thought...

	Of no importance to him, he turns away...

	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
	exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
	grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
	under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and
	HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...

	THE AUDITORIUM (POV).

	The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
	small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

	EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the
	corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
	CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
	M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
	SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
	AWAY...

				M.J.
		You could use a long hot bath, you
		know that?  You better get somebody
		to drive you home.

				HELEN
		Why can't I drive home?  I will.
		You.  Look at you.  You need a ride
		home.  And you don't even know it.

				M.J.
			(beat)
		Well, thanks.

	The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
	the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
	SHOT.

	THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

				SUSAN
		Hey!  Halloran!  What's the story
		here?

	On the two women getting in the car...

				HELEN
		If she has to ask, she's never
		gonna know.

	HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE
	NIGHT.

FADE IN:

EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of
Los Angeles.

EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
from the back with a satchel and heads inside.


INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
can be heard from a second floor balcony.
DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
dials. Beat. Into phone --
                         DOUGLAS
           Last delivery's finally here.
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
references the sounds from upstairs --
                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Party?
                         DOUGLAS
           Introducing a new line of jewelry.
                         ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
           Told her to spend a little time with
           the family jewels first.
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
Handing over the satchel and heading out --
                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Keep it real.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
doors slide closed...

                                                              3.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
a walk-in vault.

The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
the vault.
A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
the cart into the vault.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

A train arrives.   People jostle on and off.
One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
over his shoulder.
The train doors begin to close.   When...
A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
Intense.
Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
platform into the tunnel and disappear.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
door, securing the vault.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
voltage third rail.
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
back up and away from the danger.
                        FAIT
          Watch yourself.
Miles nods.

                                                              4.
                           FAIT
          Keep it tight.
Miles nods again, and they set off.


INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
scans the security monitors.

ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS
depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
in the suit riding up.

BACK TO SCENE
Douglas settles back in with his magazine.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait
starts to open it.
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press
their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.

INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
and rights, following more spray paint.
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
painted circle.
                           FAIT
          Bull's-eye.
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait
pulls out a cell phone.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY

                                                                    5.

A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
just STATIC.
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
phone.
                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
           Yes?

                         FAIT (V.O.)
           We're in position.
                         CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
           Delivery confirmed. The stones are
           there.
                           FAIT (V.O.)
           Not for long.
CLICK.   HISS.
Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And
takes off.

EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
the park. The top floor is at street level.
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
an eight-story drop.
Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
lets go.
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
the balcony.


INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                                                    6.
A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...
                         SU (0.S.)
           Where are the stones?

Christophe turns.       Sees Su standing behind him.
                         CHRISTOPHE
                   (French accent)
           Who the fuck are you?
Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.
                         SU
           Who's getting them for you?

                            CHRISTOPHE
           Fuck off.
Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-
slap.
                            CHRISTOPHE
           I'll tell you.
                            SU
           I know.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
Fait hammers at the last layer. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A hole appears under the private display table, where it
can't be seen by the room's security camera.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
earwig.
                            FAIT
           Daria.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
monitors again. Everything a-okay.

                                                                   7.


ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
A limo pulls up outside.


EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
short, tight dress emerges.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY

Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
                        DARIA
          I'm here for the reception.
                          DOUGLAS
          Name, please?
                          DARIA
          Angie Rawlins.
Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers.
                        DOUGLAS
          Thank you. You can go on up.       Front
          elevator, to the mezzanine.
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
                        DARIA
          ... I hate these things.      Don't you
          hate these things?
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm just here to do my job.
Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking
what she sees.
                        DARIA
          Then again, you never know who you're
          going to meet...
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the
desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
                          DARIA

                                                               8.
          I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
          any of those boring people upstairs.
Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.
                         DOUGLAS
          Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do.
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.

DARIA'S POV
The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big
pecs, big penises.


BACK TO SCENE
Daria steps back.
                        DARIA
          Well, I suppose I should go up and
          see what they're selling.
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
                         DARIA
          Tommy...
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
Daria walks toward Tommy:
She whispers into a hidden mike --
                        DARIA
          Change of plans. He's gay.
Tommy hears it over his earwig.
                         TOMMY
          No way.
                         DARIA
          Yeah way.
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike --
                          FAIT
          Tommy.    Your turn.

                                                            9.

A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike --
                         TOMMY
          Uh-uh.

                        FAIT
          This isn't a conversation.    Do it.
It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit.
                         TOMMY
          Shit.
                         DARIA
          Key-card.

Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
                        DARIA
          Why don't you keep my purse?     I
          shouldn't be too long.
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
Then heads toward the elevator, as...
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
                         TOMMY
          ... Aloha.
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
 thru 28.)
Douglas looks up from his magazine.
                         DOUGLAS
          Hi.
                        TOMMY
          I hope you don't take offense at
          this... but I just have such a
          weakness for a man in uniform.
                        DOUGLAS
          If that's your thing...
                        TOMMY
          Uniform's definitely my thing. I
          mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
          mmm, seafood. Y'know?
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm not actually supposed to be

                                                   10.
          talking on duty.
                        TOMMY
          Who's talking? Honey, this is a
          flirting... But you're probably just
          another good-looking man wasting it
          all on women. World's full of fools.
Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
                        TOMMY
          Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
          A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
          pictures of those underfed, white
          males and let's broaden your
          horizons.

                        TOMMY (CONT'D)
          I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
          I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
          not too cute for you. And don't tell
          me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
          come over there and slap a little
          discrimination right upside your
          yummy little cheeks.
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm hooked up.
                        TOMMY
          Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-
          Jesus got there first. That bitch.
          Taking you. From me.
                        DOUGLAS
          Sorry.
                        TOMMY
          Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I
          can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
          it for your number one is keeping the
          world safe, and it's okay by me.
          Even if you are just breaking my
          heart... Guess I'll just have to come
          in here someday, let you catch me
          shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
          to have you wrestle me down and cuff
          me.
                        DOUGLAS
          I can be pretty rough.
                        TOMMY
          Don't you get me all excited now.   I
          was just learning to accept my
          disappointment.

                                                                11.

Tommy sticks out his hand.
                           TOMMY
          Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel.

Shaking hands --
                        DOUGLAS
          Douglas. And, man, I really gotta
          get back to what I'm supposed to be
          doing, okay?
He looks away.     Scans the monitors.


ANGLE - MONITORS
Everything looks normal.

ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS
Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
Tommy relaxes.
                        TOMMY
          I'll leave you alone. But is it okay
          if I just stand here and stare at the
          muscles I'll be missing for the rest
          of my
          life?
OFF which...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
attention. He does.
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
controls to go down.

ANOTHER ANGLE
As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...

TOMMY
who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with
Douglas.

                                                            12.
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
attention diverted.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
Fait films the room. When he's done....

CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA
We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
work.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
continues diverting Douglas's attention.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
door.
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.

                                                             13.
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
canister of liquid nitrogen.
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
door. The outside frosts over.
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.
                        FAIT
          Out.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

Speeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone.
                        SU
          ... I want to report a crime in
          progress.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait is the last one down through the hole.   Beat.    He looks
at the others.
                        FAIT
          Faith.
                        MILES
          Faith.
                        DARIA
          Faith.
Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes
the button. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
out of the door.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
They felt a rumble.   Tommy covers --
                        TOMMY
          Earthquake.

                                                             14.

Douglas checks the monitors.      Everything looks okay.
                        TOMMY
          Bet you know how to hit a ten on the
          Richter scale...


INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door
in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
augured into the opposite wall.
                          DARIA
          Holy shit...

Fait's already swinging open the vault.
                        FAIT
          This will trigger the silent alarm.
          Let's go. We got eleven minutes.
Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop
all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling
out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait
empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When...
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And
stops, admiring them.
                        FAIT
          ... I love colored stones... Look at
          this...
He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.
                        FAIT
          Two-point-seven million.
Into the bag.
                        MILES
          Whose shit we stealing, anyway?
                        FAIT
          Drug dealers and money launderers.
                          DARIA
          Works for me.
Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,
pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.
                        FAIT
          This I can use.

                                                           15.

And pockets it.
                         DARIA
          T.

Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
diamonds. Many more in the bag.
                         FAIT
          Pow.
He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...
Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.   Beat.
Fait answers.

                         FAIT
          Go.
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets.
                        SU
          Your employer betrayed you. The
          police are on the way. Leave the
          black stones.
                         FAIT
          Who is this?
                        SU
          You know the ones I mean.
                        FAIT
          Don't think I'll do that.
Fait just hangs up.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
Tommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP
outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front
door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.
                        TOMMY
          Shit.  Five-0 at the do'.
                  (then, aloud to
                  Douglas)
          Better move my car.

                                                          16.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait grabs a bag of jewels.
                           FAIT
          Go time.     Leave the rest.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
SWAT swarms in.
Tommy exits behind them.


INT./EXT. LIMO - DAY
Tommy gets in.    A SWAT COP signals him.
                           SWAT COP
          Move it out.

INT. UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
Fait, Miles, and Daria run.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Slam! Fait, Miles, and Daria blast out the access door.
Fait kneels, feels the track.
                         FAIT
          Stopped the trains.
                  (then)
          We're in the rabbit hole, they're
          sending down the snakes.
                  (then)
          Daria comes with me.
                  (to Miles)
          I got no idea where you should go,
          but you know where to end up.
Miles nods.
                           FAIT
          Faith.
                           MILES
          Faith.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

                                                                17.
Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
running like hell. Rounds a curve.      Ahead are the rear
lights of a stopped train.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FAIT AND DARIA - DAY
Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a
station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his
head around the corner of the train.


FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM
SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY
helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND
COP jumps back down.
                          SWAT COP #2
             All clear.

ANGLE BACK
Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the
top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.
As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT
COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,
etc.
Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting
closer. Looking up. Just as...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's leg just clears the window.      They don't see it.
But...

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
As Fait rolls onto the top of the train...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react.      To the Driver --
                          SWAT COP #3
             Hold it.

                                                              18.

A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around.    The Cop
checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing.
                         SWAT COP #3
                  (radios)
          Train's clear.
The Cop exits.    The Driver enters his compartment.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
ANOTHER SWAT COP stands outside the Driver's window.
                         DRIVER
          Okay to go?
                        SWAT COP #4
          Just hang tight.
During which, just above them...
Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her
position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She
looks back at him in disbelief.
                         FAIT
          Nice.
That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a
voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.
                         RADIO (V.O.)
          All clear.
                          SWAT COP #4
                    (to Driver)
          Okay.    Get this train outta here.
Whereupon the train jerks to a start.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
running toward the rear of the stopped train.   Leaping onto
the rear steps. When...
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
front of him.

                                                             19.
                        SU
          The stones.

                        MILES
          You'll have to come and get 'em.

Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
goes.


INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
from their heads.
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
car takes a wide curve.
Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
the train.
Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
out both hands as far as he can. And...
Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
lets her go, they both die.

INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY
Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
the bag down, cursing in Chinese.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.

                                                            20.
Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
of black diamonds. Still has them.
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
they melt into the crowd of commuters.


EXT. AIRPORT - GENERAL AVIATION TERMINAL - DUSK
A stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac
next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived.
The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard. The
man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates grace and power.
As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
retrieve baggage...
A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.   She's
also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.     SONA.
She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --
                        LING
          Enjoying California?
CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.
                        CHARLES
          Hope we're not here long.    I hate
          sunshine.
Ling kisses Sona on the lips.    Then --
                        SONA
          We may have a problem.
Ling's mood quickly darkens.
                        LING
          The stones?
                        SONA
          The exchange was just robbed.
                        LING
          ... Let's hope that was part of the
          plan.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Swarming with police. When... Su steps off the elevator.
He's carrying the bag of jewels he took from Miles. To a
COP --
                        SU

                                                            21.
          Who's in charge?
                        COP
          Who wants to know?
Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.   The Cop scopes it a
moment. He's clearly impressed.
                        COP
          Follow me.
As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault...

INT. VANESSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

VANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on
her computer. The door opens. Fait enters. His daughter.
                        FAIT
          You know it's past your bedtime.
                        VANESSA
          Just a little longer.
                        FAIT
                  (imitating sweetly)
          'Just a little longer'... School
          tomorrow, baby. Let's go.
Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the
computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she
doesn't dawdle.
                       FAIT
          'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'
          'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-
          time.
Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once
around the room and tucks her into bed.
                        FAIT
          You bag some Z's now, you hear?
                        VANESSA
          Okay.
                        FAIT
          ... Wait a second.
                        VANESSA
          What?
                        FAIT
          I think there's something behind your

                                                               22.
          ear.
                        VANESSA
          Oh, please, that is so lame.     It's in
          your hand.

She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.
More nothing. She's stumped.
Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,
there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.
                        VANESSA
          How'd you do that?

Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.
                          FAIT
          Good night.
Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her.
                        FAIT
          Angels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,
          watch her, while she rests.
A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa
holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available
light and shines in the dark.
Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.

INT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Fait enters.     Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.    To Tonita
--
                        FAIT
          She'll stay down now.
                        TONITA
          She won't listen to me lately.     Only
          you.
                        FAIT
          I'll have a talk with her about it
          tomorrow.
Still to the nanny --
                        FAIT
          I got some work to do in the office.
          You can go on to bed.

                                                            23.
                        TONITA
          I'm watching TV, if you need me.
Fait exits.


INT. FAIT'S BAR/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait enters.    Tommy and Daria are there.

                        TOMMY
          What the hell happened?
Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room
to another door.


INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
They enter.    Fait shuts the door.
                        TOMMY
          Should we be considering a
          long vacation in a warm,
          foreign climate where there's
          no extradition?
Fait's thinking it through.
                        FAIT
          The guy who called was only
          interested in the black stones...
                        DARIA
          Christophe sold us out.
                          FAIT
          Or something.
Just then, Miles enters.
                          DARIA
          You made it.
                        MILES
          By the skin of my ass. Some
          Chinese dude kicked me around
          the motherfuckin' block. Busted
          my ear piece.
He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and
tosses it on the table.
                        MILES
          Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to

                                                              24.
          rethink the no-gun policy.
                        TOMMY
          Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least
          you didn't have to play all foxy with
          the rent-a-cop.

Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds.
                        FAIT
          Means this is all we got.
                        DARIA
          So what do we do?
                        FAIT
          You all wait to hear from me.
                        TOMMY
          Where're you going?
                        FAIT
          To get some answers.
Miles moves to go with him.
                        MILES
          I got your back.
                        FAIT
          No. I got us into this.     I'll call
          you if I need you.
Daria moves to him.   Their eyes meet.
                         DARIA
          Be careful.
Fait gives her a kiss.   Then goes.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Christophe's arms are   wrapped around the large fish tank,
one arm over the top,   the other through the legs of the
stand. His hands are    bound. He can't move. His beaten
face is pressed to the   glass. Large, weird fish swim past
in front of him.
The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side
of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe.
Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with
him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs
stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow
them.

                                                            25.

                        LING
          So this is Mr. Christophe?
                        SONA
          Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish
          tank are a new look.
                        LING
          Apparently we're not his first
          visitors today.
                        CHRISTOPHE
          Please, Monsieur Ling --
Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder.

                        LING
          Whatever you're going to say... Make
          it the truth.

EXT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - M1A1 TANK - NIGHT
Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot
goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is
spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing
seemingly at random. When...
The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in
front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.
                        VOICE (O.S.)
          Bang.
A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,
pops his head up out of the tank.
                        ARCHIE
          Like it?
                        FAIT
          It's cool.
As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --
                        ARCHIE
          Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo
          included... Reactive armor, twin M240
          machine guns, 120mm smoothbore
          cannon. Guaranteed to get you
          through the rougher areas of the city
          and keep the neighbors in line.
                        FAIT
          Pass.

                                                         26.

                        ARCHIE
          How about a Marine Corps assault
          hovercraft?
                        FAIT
          I got other business.
Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN
UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.
                        MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS
          We're outta room over here, Arch.
                        ARCHIE
          Stack 'em in the office, if you have
          to.
Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.
                        ARCHIE
          ... You weren't downtown tonight by
          any chance, were you, Tony?
                        FAIT
          Don't know what you're talking about.
                        ARCHIE
          Me either.

          Ever see black diamonds before?
                        ARCHIE
          White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil
          Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips.
          Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.
Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black
diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.
Studies them a moment. Shrugs.
                        ARCHIE
          You got me.
                        FAIT
          Find out how much they're worth.
                        ARCHIE
          There a timetable on this, or --
                        FAIT
          Yesterday.
                        ARCHIE
          That's what I figured.

                                                                27.

Fait's heading out.
                        FAIT
          I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a
          guy who fucked me over.


INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed
door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly
out into the room. Looking for Christophe.
Fait continues moving around through the room. When he
steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.
Water. The carpet's soaked.
His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a
switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.
REVEAL Christophe.     Stuffed inside the tank.     Sleeping with
the fishes.
                        SU (O.S.)
          Looks dead to me.
Behind him.   Fait turns around.      Sees Su.   Sitting on a
sofa.
                        FAIT
          Guess you got to him first.
                           SU
          Not me.     Someone else.
Fait does the math.
                        FAIT
          ... You're the one who called me.
          The one who took on my guy... Who the
          fuck are you, man?
                          SU
          My name is Su.
                           FAIT
          Cool.     I'm Sally.
                        SU
          I want the black stones.

                                                                  28.

                            FAIT
             Yeah?   Make me an offer.
Su stands.

                           SU
             You can walk out of here.
                            FAIT
             ... No deal.
Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the
door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved
by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The
phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up.

                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
             Christophe here. Leave a message.
BEEP.
                           LING (V.O.)
             I know you're there, Mr. Fait.
Beat.   Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone.
                            FAIT
             Who's this?
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room
service. Ling's on a cell phone.
                             LING
             The man for   whom Mr. Christophe
             arranged to   have the black stones
             brought into   the country and
             deposited at   the jewelry exchange.
             The man who   wants them back. Now.

             Fine.   How much?
                           LING
             Maybe you didn't understand me.    The
             stones are already mine.
                           FAIT
             I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get
             your bid in or go fuck yourself.

                           LING
             I don't have time for this.
                           FAIT
             That your final offer?

                           LING
             I can be a very dangerous man, Mr.
             Fait.
Fait just hangs up.
                        FAIT
          Everybody think I'm the fucking
          Goodwill or something...? Look, I've
          had a shitty night, and so far, I got
          zip for all my troubles. So I don't
          know who the fuck you are, and I
          don't care. But hear this: you can
          beat my ass around the block all
          night --
          Brother, it ain't gonna get you those
          stones.
A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...
As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...

EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT
Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.

INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
Fait doesn't need it.
                           FAIT
             Oh, man...
He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits    it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.

                                                               30.
INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.

EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.
                        LING THUG #1
          Give us the stones.
                        FAIT
          Man, how many times I gotta tell
          people: I'm a business man. Make me
          a motherfucking offer.
                        LING THUG #2
          Here's your offer.
He cocks his pistol.   Beat.
                        FAIT
          That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.
          'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I
          ain't got the stones.
                        LING THUG #1
          Then you're gonna tell us where they
          are.
Whereupon a...
BOTTLE
Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one
Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link
fence.
REVEAL
the person who threw the bar.   Su. The fight's on.   Two on

                                                            31.
two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
gets it. When...
Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
escaping with his arm.
The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down.
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
piece.
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs.
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.
                        SU
          Over here.
Fait follows, right on his heels.
The dogs close in.
Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
in after Fait.
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
the door shut.
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.
The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As
Fait digs out the phone, to Su --
                        FAIT
          Man, what the hell's up with these
          fucking stones?

          Go.

CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR
Surveillance camera footage of Archie's.

Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball
caps, enter Archie's place, put Archie up against a wall and
start to beat something out of him.

          it out on the street, trying to get
          info on the stones. Next thing I

          up... Now, there are three
          significant elements to notice here.
          One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're
          heavily armed. Three, they're gonna

Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen,
Archie surrenders immediately.

          but then, see, I'm thinking: How
          would I be able to tell Tony what
          happened to the stones? Right? What
          good am I dead or on life-support.
          So I threw in the towel.

Big question is, who's behind the

                        SU
          You have no choice.

Beat.   Fait realizes what this means.
                        FAIT
          ... Shit... We gotta go see
          Chambers...
                  (beat, then)
          Oh, god... Vanessa...

INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - NIGHT
Large, empty, brightly-lit.    The door opens, and the limo
pulls in.

INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The limo stops inside the hangar.    To Charles, re:   Vanessa
--
                        LING
          Find a place to put her.
Then, as Charles forces Vanessa out --
                        VANESSA
          My daddy's gonna come and kick your
          butts.
Sona just reaches out and slaps her. It hurts and surprises
Vanessa. Tears come to her eyes. But she's Fait's
daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry. Charles
takes Vanessa out. Ling's mind is still on the phone call.
                        LING
          Su says he has the stones... But why
          cut me off? Why not negotiate for
          the girl? It doesn't make sense.
                        SONA

                                                           38.
             The buyers fly in tomorrow.   Should
             we stop them?
                            LING
             We'll never regain their confidence.
                     (beat)
             We need information. Find the right
             people. Pay whatever it costs.
             Something's not right. Something's
             happening with the stones.
                           SONA
             What about the girl?

                           LING
             We'll need her... She stays alive.
             For now.

INT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
In motion.     Fait and Su.   Fait on the cell to Tommy.
                             FAIT
             I'm on the way to Chambers... Yeah, I
             know, but I got no other choice.
             Just get the word into his pipeline
             that I'm coming and want permission
             to visit... I'll get back to you...
             Faith...
                      (hangs up)
             Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and
             give the stones back.
                      (then)
             Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join
             the Peace Corps.
Su looks over.     Beat.
                           SU
             I'm sorry about your daughter... How
             old is she?
                           FAIT
             This ain't the Biography Channel.
             Let's just get there.
A long beat.     L.A. moving by outside.
                            FAIT
             Eight.   She'll be nine in September.
Beat.
                           SU

                                                          39.
          Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends...
                          FAIT
          Never happen.    I'll just kill
          'em.

                        SU
          I wish it were that easy.
Another beat.   Then --
                        FAIT
          About time I got the 4-1-1.
                          SU
          4-1-1?

                        FAIT
          What's this all about?
                        SU
          The stones aren't what you think they
          are.
                          FAIT
          No shit.
                  (then)
          How about the guy who has Vanessa?
                        SU
          He's exactly what you think he is --
          a thief and a killer.
                          FAIT
          Great...

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
A battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar.
We see Vanessa inside the camper. She's screaming. Loudly.
Not scared. Pissed. As...
Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint.

ANGLE - ACROSS HANGAR
Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles.
                        CHARLES
          Where'd you get that piece of shit?
                        LING THUG #1
          Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa
          have a long walk back from the

                                                              40.
          campground.
                        CHARLES
          You're sure you cleaned it out?
                        LING THUG #1
          Everything except the denture cream
          and adult diapers.
Vanessa's still screaming.   It's getting on Charles' nerves.
                        CHARLES
          I'm sick of her already.
He marches toward the van.   Unlocks the rear door and slides
it open.


INT./EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
                         CHARLES
          Shut up!
                         VANESSA
          You shut up!
                         CHARLES
          Go to sleep!
Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns
it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And...
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
camper.
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
fear go away, but giving her strength.

CLOSEUP - FAIT
As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him
--
                        FAIT
          Angels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,
          watch her, while she rests.

OFF which, as Su regards him...

INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY
A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as
dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until
they reach the last cell.
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.    Hanging
blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.
Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One
sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...


INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
Joel's office.
JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
terms of his incarceration.
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
and the daily mail.
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.
                          CHAMBERS
             Metz.
The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.
                           CHAMBERS
             D.V.D.'s broke.
                           METZ
             Get you a new one straight away, Mr.
             Chambers.
Metz goes.
Beat.   Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.
                            CHAMBERS
             Thanks for your patience.   Man needs
             his nightly rest.
                     (then)
             Who's the gook?

                                                            42.

                        FAIT
          ... Chinese guy.
                        CHAMBERS
          ... No shoes in my crib.

Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --
                         CHAMBERS
          In.
The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-
trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.
                        FAIT
          How you doing, Jump?
                        CHAMBERS
          Don't waste my precious time.
                        FAIT
          ... I got a problem.
                         CHAMBERS
          How's Daria?

          ... Good.
                        CHAMBERS
          Always was good. From the moment I
          found her till the moment you took
          her away from me. Problem, you say?
                        FAIT
          ... The black stones.
                        CHAMBERS
          Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
          money. But that all stopped. You
          stopped that. You decided it was
          okay to put an end to that. Black
          stones. Go on.
                        FAIT
          I need 'em back.
                        CHAMBERS
          Only smart thing was not pimping her
          yourself, 'cause then I'da been real
          sore-angry, and you'da both been real
          cold-dead...
                        CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
          But you don't pimp, do you? Just a

                                                              43.
          thief in the night. Stealing what
          don't belong to you.
Chambers turns to Su.   In SUBTITLED KOREAN --
                        CHAMBERS
          You like tall white women?
Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English --
                        CHAMBERS
          He can't talk?
                        SU
          I don't speak Korean.

Chambers carves up a sausage.
                        CHAMBERS
          Bought myself this Korean club
          downtown. Packing in the Seoul
          brothers 24-7-365... Black man
          gouging Koreans, ain't that a
          switch... Motherfuckers got faces
          like walls, but they love to drink
          liquor and look at naked girls...
          Place is no shitbox, either. Got me
          an office looks like a kabuki love
          palace. My own little sanctuary --
A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.
                        CHAMBERS
          -- just waiting for when I parole
          out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the
          poon.
                        FAIT
          ... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in
          this. I gotta have the stones, or
          she's dead.
No response.   Chambers just keeps eating.
                        FAIT
          If you need something more than that,
          here it is...
                  (this is hard)
          I'm begging you, Jump.
Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.    Wipes his
face. Finally --
                       CHAMBERS
          Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking
          news. I'm watching it wondering why.

                                                                44.
          What's worth that kind of trouble,
          that kind of heat? Gotta be
          something good. Gotta be something
          expensive.
Beat.   He meets Fait's eyes.   Holds them.

                        FAIT
          She's my little girl.
                         CHAMBERS
          Make another one... Lotta offspring
          running around. Big scores're rare
          in a lifetime.
Another beat.   That's it.   No deal.

Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers.     Su stops him.
                        CHAMBERS
          Slope's no dope.
He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries
are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.
                         CHICKENS
          Let me cut one of these
          motherfuckers.
                         CHAMBERS
          Your choice.
Chickens is happy.   Thrusts the knife at Fait.       When...
Su reaches out and catches the   blade.  Catches it with just
the thumb and forefinger of one   hand.  And holds it like
that. Holds it hard. Chickens     can't push and can't pull.
Doesn't know what to do next.    Finally yanks really hard.
And...
Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A
beat. Then, to Fait --
                        CHAMBERS
          Say hey to Daria. And don't forget
          your shoes.

EXT. PRISON - DAY
Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche.
                        FAIT
          I used to look up to that guy.      All I
          wanted was to be like him.

                                                            45.
                       SU
         In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.
                        FAIT
         This ain't Taiwan.
                 (then)
         Only thing we can do now is find out
         where the stones are and go take 'em.
                       SU
         You make it sound easy.
                        FAIT
         It won't be.
They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.     Looks back at
the prison. Suddenly realizing something.
                       FAIT
         ... They're at his club.
                       SU
         How do you know?
                        FAIT
         I know. I can feel it.      That ever
         happen to you?
                        SU
         No.
                       FAIT
         I thought Chinese people were all
         mystical and shit.
                       SU
         We like to gamble.     Not guess.
                       FAIT
         It's no guess... But I could be
         wrong... We'll hit the club. You
         gotta see Archie.
                        SU
         Archie?
                       FAIT
         He's gotta remember something about
         the guys who took down his place.
                       SU
         What if he can't?
                       FAIT
         Pretend it's Taiwan.    Make him
         remember.

INT. HANGAR - DAY
RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,
carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton
truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which
he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.
He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and
starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is
looking in the back of the truck.
                          RUSSELL
          Hey!    Get away from there!
Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.

                        RUSSELL
          What are you doing?!
                        CHARLES
          Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if
          I could help with something.
                        RUSSELL
          You can't! It's very delicate
          equipment! Stay away! Just stay
          away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
                        RUSSELL
          Stay away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
                        RUSSELL
          Stay away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
                         SONA
          Stop it.
Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun
screaming inside the camper.
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy!
Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --

                                                            47.

                        CHARLES
          I'm backing away... I'm backing
          away...
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Charles joins Sona.   Re:   Russell --
                        CHARLES
          Someone give the geek his Ritalin.
                        SONA
          At least he's doing his job. Which
          is more than I can say for some
          people.
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.
                        SONA
          Tape her up and gag her.
As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,
unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.
Then opens the door. And...
Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his
waist.
                         VANESSA
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I
          want my daddy!
                        CHARLES
          Get the hell off me.
He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on
her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face
away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
                        CHARLES
          ... Waste of time... I can think of a
          better way of shutting you
          up --
Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in
pain and lets her go.
Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

                                                           48.

Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We
suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying
just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes
the remote. And...


EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is
surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key
and remote are gone.
                        CHARLES
          Shit.
                  (yells to Sona)
          She got the key!

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into
the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."

CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL
To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An
extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the
can...

ANGLE - CAMPER
takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't
see where she's going. But she's going.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The camper careens around the large space.   Charles
scrambles after.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.   And...
... CRASHES into a support post.
As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt...

                                                           49.


INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant
decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra
money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but
the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.
Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the
door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc.
ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through
the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.
                        ODION
          Delicious Daria.
                         DARIA
          'Sup, Odion?
                        ODION
          Long time no see.
Then, checking her out --
                         ODION
          Like cognac. Just getting better.
                  (then)
          So what brings you around?
                        DARIA
          ... Sometimes you need an old friend,
          y'know?
                         ODION
          Got trouble?
                        DARIA
          ... With a capital 'T.'
                       ODION
          Tony Fait? Thought you and him were
          tight. Bonnie and Clyde.
                        DARIA
          Used to be that way. Not treating me
          right these days. The kid's all he
          cares about.
                        ODION
          ... What do you want me to do?
                        DARIA
          ... Man, I don't know. Probably
          nothing you can do. I just

                                                     50.
          thought...
                  (then)
          Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't
          know what I was thinking. I
          shouldn't even be here like this.
          Sorry, Odion.

Daria starts to go.   Odion stops her.
                        ODION
          Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.
                        DARIA
          Back in the day... Just always seemed
          like you and I had something special
          between us.

                        ODION
          Didn't know you thought so.
                        DARIA
          I always cared for you, Odion.
          That's why I'm here.
                        ODION
          ... You looking for a job?
                        DARIA
          I need something.
                        ODION
          ... So maybe you could work here.
                        DARIA
          Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.
                        ODION
          You were the best. Not many girls
          pulling in two g's a night.
                        DARIA
          Yeah, but it's been a while for
          that... Might not remember how.
                        ODION
          Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't
          forget that stuff.
Daria considers it a moment.
                        DARIA
          Don't know how Jump'd feel about it.
          Having me back.
                        ODION
          Hey, you let me worry about Jump,

                                                            51.
          okay?
                  (then)
          Meantime, why don't you come on in,
          and you and me can, y'know, talk some
          more about it.

Beat.   Daria knows the look in his eyes.   Gets the subtext.
                         DARIA
          ... Just talk?
Odion's drinking her in.
                         ODION
          ... No.

A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into
Odion's, smiling at him --

INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY
Su and Archie.
                        SU
          They have boxing matches in the day?
                        ARCHIE
          Not exactly boxing. More dangerous.
          No gloves. No rules. Big money.
          Very illegal... Started holding 'em
          during the daytime to fool the cops.
                        SU
          The man you remembered -- how do you
          know he will be here?
                         ARCHIE
          I don't. But Chambers owns the
          operation, so I figure it's a good
          place to start.
                  (then)
          This is it.
They turn into...

EXT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A cavernous industrial building.   Cars parked on the
perimeter.

INT./EXT. SU'S T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
As they park --

                                                            52.

                        SU
          How will you recognize him?
                        ARCHIE
          I didn't see his face.   But I'll know
          his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten
          carats. Round cut with   square mount.
          Good color and clarity.   I remember
          thinking what it would  do to my face
          if he hit me.
OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to
help disguise himself...


INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a
gate to the fight arena beyond.
                        SU
          How do we get in?
                        ARCHIE
          Leave that to me.
Then, to the Guard --
                        ARCHIE
          Hey, man, how you doing? Got a
          fighter here I want to enter.
Su shoots him a surprised look.
                        ARCHIE
          My man's gonna put the rest of these
          bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there
          and get all Chinese on 'em -- the
          teeth are gonna fly, the blood's
          gonna run... Gonna be fun.
                        GUARD
          Whatever... You're number twelve,
          Bruce.
He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make
their way toward the arena --
                        SU
          I didn't come here to fight.
                        ARCHIE
          You won't have to. That was just to
          get us in.

                                                                  53.
They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men.
Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.
A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.
Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the
shit out of each other.

Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of
plastic    over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch
lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
shield    themselves from flying blood.
                          ARCHIE
            Good day, over a million dollars'll
            pass hands in here.

                             SU
            Find the ring.
                             ARCHIE
            Yeah.    Okay.
He looks around.      Lotta African-American males.
                          ARCHIE
            Could take a little while.
As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands,
and Su follows...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts
to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him
back toward a sofa.
                             DARIA
            Sit down.
Odion sits.
                          DARIA
            Put on some music.
Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.        Cranks up some HIP-HOP.
                            DARIA
            Nah.    Something slower.
Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.        A SLOW TUNE fills the room.
                          DARIA
            That's good... Now just relax... And
            watch...

                                                            54.
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the
music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy.
And Odion's eating it up.


EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.   Via
earwig mike --
                            FAIT
          Tommy.

INT./EXT. PEST CONTROL TRUCK - DAY

Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform.
                        TOMMY
          Here come da bug man.

EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY
The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control
truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest
spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door.
                            TOMMY
          Hey.    Howzit?
                        DOORMAN
          What the hell you doing?
                        TOMMY
          Pest control. Don't tell me you
          didn't get your notice.
                            DOORMAN
          What notice?
                        TOMMY
          See, that burns my ass right to the
          bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my
          job... Anyway, putting that aside, if
          you had gotten your notice, you'd
          know there's a new city ordinance
          saying all businesses catering to
          foreigners gotta be sprayed.
                          DOORMAN
          Yeah?    How come?
                        TOMMY
          'Cause foreign people're bringing all

                                                     55.
          their scary-assed foreign bugs over
          here. Y'know, in their luggage and
          shit. And then the bugs're getting
          loose and fucking everything up --
          eating all the trees and everything,
          y'know, making people sick... Anyway,
          city says we gotta spray to prevent
          any infestation and possible spread.
                        DOORMAN
          We're doing business inside. Can't
          let you just start hosing the place
          with bug spray.
                        TOMMY
          Yeah, well, maybe you should at least
          ask the manager about it.
                        DOORMAN
          Manager's busy.
                        TOMMY
          ... Okay. Your call. Just know the
          city quarantine people'll be here
          first thing tomorrow.
                        DOORMAN
          Quarantine people?
                        TOMMY
          They'll be shutting you down for non-
          compliance... Peace out.
Tommy starts to go.
                        DOORMAN
          Wait, wait, wait.
Tommy stops.
                        DOORMAN
          City's really gonna come and close us
          up?
                        TOMMY
          Quicker'n a Zip-loc.
                        DOORMAN
          ... You sure you're not fucking with
          me?
                        TOMMY
          I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why
          would I be fucking with you?
The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then --

                                                              56.

                        TOMMY
          Look. Let's do this. You let me
          start with a couple small rooms,
          y'know, offices or something,
          someplace you don't have customers.
          Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother
          anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug
          bombs, and then we'll do the rest
          later. How's that?
The Doorman considers a moment.     Then --
                        DOORMAN
          ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and
          come on.


INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin.
Odion's starting to salivate.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a
normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A
large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of
the room.
The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around
in amazement.

                          TOMMY
          ... Look.   At.   This.
                        DOORMAN
          Just do your thing and go,
          bro.
                          TOMMY
          Roger that.
He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off
one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes --
                        TOMMY
          Just keep the door closed and be sure
          to give this shit a full hour before
          anyone comes in.
OFF the closing door...

                                                              57.
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto
ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story
window. A window into...


INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.
Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.
BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs
and toss them out.
As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out
a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room
quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS
from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something
bigger.
BLEEE.   He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
                             FAIT
             Safe.
He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And...
There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure.
                             FAIT
             Take it down.
Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A
big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50
cal."

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and
sexy for Odion.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the
Barrett.
                           MILES
             Even with the music, they're gonna
             hear it when I fire this tank buster.
                             FAIT
             Daria.   Get ready to move.
                      (then)

                                                                58.
          Do it.
Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.      Miles
FIRES. BIG BANG.


INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Odion starts.
                          ODION
          What was that?

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by
the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.       Looks back at
Daria. A realization dawning.
                        ODION
          'Sometimes you need an old friend'...
He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens
the door.
A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.
                        CHAMBERS MAN
          It came from the office.
                         ODION
          Watch her.   Don't let her leave.
Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at
Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
Fait's tossed the safe.     No stones.
                          MILES
          Not here?
                          FAIT
          They're here.    Somewhere else.
                        MILES
          What're you talking about?

                                                              59.
                         FAIT
           I'm telling you, they're here.
                         MILES
           What're we gonna do?

                           FAIT
           Everyone out.
Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart.
                         MILES
           What about you?
                         FAIT
           I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find
           'em.
                         MILES
           I'm not leaving you.
                           FAIT
           Yes, you are.    Go.   Now.
Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop.
                        MILES
           T. Come on, man. They're outside.
           Give it up.
                         FAIT
           Shut up and get the fuck outta here!
           That's an order!
Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are
trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.
Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Daria finishes dressing.     When...
                         CHAMBERS MAN
           ... Y'know, I got the big one...
Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a
spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --
                         DARIA
           Keep it in your pants.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
CRASH!   Odion and his men break down the door.

                                                               60.

Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.
Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first
men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And
then...

The guns are out.     All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
Daria walks out the front door.

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY

Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he
eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who
Chambers is addressing.
                        CHAMBERS
          ... If you're willing to pay five,
          you're willing to pay ten.
                           CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
          You're    willing to pay ten, you're
          willing    to pay twenty. Twenty,
          forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not
          selling    till I know exactly where the
          ceiling    is.
Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling.
                        CHAMBERS
          You like foreplay?
                        LING
          How much money do you want for the
          stones?
                         CHAMBERS
          I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up
          drills -- girl's gotta get in there
          and be ready to score points. Bring
          it straight to the motherfucking
          hoop. You understand?
                  (beat)
          So, instead of us going back and
          forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for
          you to think of a number. A very
          high number. A very final number. A
          number so high and final it'll get me
          off good, bam, right when I hear it.
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't
looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...

                                                             61.

Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...
Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers
doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a
big man.

But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and
quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's
finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the
blood and swelling --

                          CHAMBERS
          Okay, okay...
Ling stops.

                        CHAMBERS
          Ain't worth my life... I'll take the
          five and call it a game.

INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE CHAMBERS' CELL - MOMENTS LATER
Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard
nothing --
                         LING
          Mr. Chambers is resting.   He says not
          to bother him.
OFF which, as Ling walks away...

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever.       The lobster
fork driven deep into the base of his skull.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
Archie still looking for the man with the diamond
pinkie-ring. Su still following.
                        ARCHIE
          ... By the way, when we do find him,
          what then?
                        SU
          I'll handle it.
In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's
unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning
airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.

                                                            62.
The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.
                        RING ANNOUNCER
          Seven advances, eleven's out...
          Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight
          versus twelve. Fighters report to
          the cage.
As Archie and Su continue the search --
                        ARCHIE
          You're after the stones, too, huh?
No response from Su.   Beat.
                        ARCHIE
          ... I did some more checking around
          to see what anyone knows about 'em...
          Guess who get back to me? My Defense
          Department connection. Now, I think
          he's calling me about this surplus F-
          14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands
          on. But no. Turns out he's calling
          to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan
          about black stones --
In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the
midget calls out --
                         RING ANNOUNCER
          Number twelve!
                        ARCHIE
                  (to Su)
          -- only they're not jewels --
                         RING ANNOUNCER
          Number twelve!
                         ARCHIE
          They're --
Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB
FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
          Twelve's right here!
Su pulls his arm back.
                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
          I'd be scared of him, too.
Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the
first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.

                                                            63.
                        BRUISER
          Let's go, chickenshit!
Su waves them off.
                          SU
          Not today...
The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su.
                           ARCHIE
          I know it    wasn't the plan. But if
          you don't    fight, they're gonna toss
          us out on    our asses. We might never
          find the    guy.

A long beat.    Su hates this place.   Su hates Archie.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted
by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To
Odion, as they pass him --
                        COP #1
          He's pretty beat up.
                        ODION
          Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy
          the jail sex, Fait.
As they continue up the stairs --
                        COP #2
          Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
          head.

EXT. HOT DOG STAND (NEAR KOREAN CLUB) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Near, but not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria,
Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance.
Via earwigs --
                        DARIA
          We're still here to help you, T.
                        MILES
          Anything you want us to do?

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's heard.
                          FAIT

                                                               64.
          Not yet.
The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand.
                         PARAMEDIC
          What?

                         FAIT
          Nothing.

CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK
His cuffed hands.    Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.
Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the
leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out
recess in the belt. Where...
Fait has a hidden handcuff key.

CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS
struggling against their duct-tape bonds.   REVEAL...

INT. CAMPER - DAY
Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's
tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON
nearby, but she's not watching.
Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.
Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and
scared.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight
leaves his corner and advances on Su.
Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to
buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly
running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,
gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
misses. Until...
Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately
it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch
carries him headfirst into a metal post.
Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,
Su uses the chance to find...

                                                             65.

ARCHIE
still checking out the hands of African-American men in
the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.


SU
Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When...

ARCHIE
Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring.


SU
dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling
he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A
solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.
Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
                          SU
          You win.
Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its
disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's
path.
                          RING ANNOUNCER
          No quitting.    Get back in there.
Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting
fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the
cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.

HOT DOG STAND - DAY
Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two     extreme MOTO-RIDERS
dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out
to eat. In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a
four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle     Daria. To her --
                          MOTO-RIDER #1
          Looking good.
She ignores them.     To each other, so she can hear --
                          MOTO-RIDER #2
          Nice rack.
                        MOTO-RIDER #1
          Like the upstairs, like the basement,

                                                              66.
          too.
                        DARIA
          Shut up, assholes...


INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops
talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the
truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The
Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --
                        PARAMEDIC
          He's all patched up.

A Cop calls inside to Fait.
                           COP #1
          Let's go.
Fait stands.     Starts out.   Into his mike --
                        FAIT
          Get ready to move.
And we see...
The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.

EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait reaches the rear doorway.      When...
He jumps. Knocks one Cop down.      Shoves another aside.   And
takes off running.
Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a
few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others
by car.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand.
To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --
                           FAIT
          Get the car.     Stay close.
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into
the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.
The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.

                                                           67.

                          MOTO-RIDER #1
          Hey!
Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.   Right
through the nylon mesh tailgate.

Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a
police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the
rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.
As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-
Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the
remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
                        MOTO-RIDER #1
          Don't let that fucker get away!
The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into
first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in
pursuit.

INT. CAMPER - DAY
Vanessa still taped up.    TV still ON.   When...
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... We go now to this breaking
          story...
ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV
Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... You're watching a man on an all-
          terrain vehicle leading police in a
          high-speed chase through downtown Los
          Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says
          the man, Anthony Fait --
Vanessa looks over in surprise.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
           -- commandeered the A.T.V. after
          escaping from police officers while
          being treated at a local hospital for
          injuries resulting from his earlier
          arrest for robbery... And this is
          certainly one of the wildest chases
          we've witnessed here in L.A...

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

                                                               68.
WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,
sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.
Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's
fast, strong and maneuverable.


One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.     The guy's right on
Fait's ass. Matching move with move.
Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While
on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.
But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an
escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At
another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.
This'll be a news highlight for days to come.


INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on
the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su
versus the five fighters. And the midget.
The different fighters use different fighting styles against
Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street
fighting...
Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one
point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another
opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a
fighting staff.
One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
Fait's everywhere.   And so is the moto-bike.   Still on his
tail.
Fait veers inside a building.   The bike follows.

INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.   One floor.   Two
floors. Up and up.
Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.   Nowhere left to go
except...
Out the window at the end.   And...
That's just where he goes.

                                                              69.
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS
The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.    Onto the
roof of a next-door building.
From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.    Jump after jump.
Longer and longer. Until...
The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.     The moto-
rider walks away, but his chase is over.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by
cops. Into his mike --
                          FAIT
           Yo.

INT. DARIA, MILES AND TOMMY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
                          DARIA
           Here.
                         FAIT
           Above ground parking garage in
           Chinatown?
                          MILES
           Know it.
                          FAIT
           Get there.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spins
and kicks and punches, and...
Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him into a
pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...
Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy
wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance.    Up the spiral ramp.

                                                             70.

Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.

INT. CAMPER - DAY

On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... And it looks like this chase will
          end here, as police seal off the
          building...
OFF Vanessa, watching...


INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.
Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
                         SU
          Where is he?
                        ARCHIE
          Decided to leave early.
                         SU
          Where'd he go?
                         ARCHIE
          Right here.
Su looks inside the car.

ANGLE - CAR
Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.
Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.
                        ARCHIE
          Good thing I brought my stunner.
He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
                        ARCHIE
          Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?

INT. CAMPER - DAY
On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls
down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.

                                                                71.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... Here's a car coming down the exit
          ramp...
We see the police approach the car.

                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... The police apparently talking to
          the driver...
The police let the car pass.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... Now letting this car drive on as
          the search inside continues...

Vanessa notices something about the car.     Looks carefully.
When...
The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle
of the people inside, and...
Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.
Which could mean only one thing:    her daddy's safe.   And
soon he'll be coming to get her.
With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-
tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless
again, her eyes go to...
Her necklace.   The chain and pink diamond pendant.
Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace
slides off onto the    bed. Then turns around and  picks up the
necklace behind her    back. Holding it as taut as  she can
between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around
her wrists.

EXT. NEAR KOREAN CLUB - HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT
The gang's all here.    All eyes on the club.
                        FAIT
          I knew the stones were in there.
                        TOMMY
          Question is, how do we get 'em out?
          Place is slamming nonstop.
A long beat.    Fait doesn't answer.
                        SU
          Something isn't right.

                                                                  72.

                         FAIT
          Yeah.   That's what I'm getting.
                          SU
          The doorman.


                         FAIT
          ... Where the hell is he?
                  (then)
          Everyone stay put.
OFF which, as he and Su go --


INT. KOREAN CLUB - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down
the hall toward Chambers' office.
                        FAIT
          No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it.
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and
listen. Hear nothing.
Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens
the door.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...
Odion and the other Chambers' men.    Dead.   Skull shot.
                          FAIT
          I get it now.
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,
where he reaches into the water and begins searching the
rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --
                        FAIT
          Are they there?
Su doesn't answer, still searching.
                        FAIT
          No. This can't fucking happen.      They
          gotta be there.
Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one
black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.

                                                                 73.
                              FAIT
             ... What?     That's it?
                           SU
             The rest are gone.

Fait can't believe it.
                           FAIT
             ... What the hell happened?        Who got
             'em?
                             SU
             ... Ling.
                           FAIT
             How do you know?
                             SU
             I know.
                           FAIT
             ... How'd he get here before us?
                             SU
             He's good.
Beat.   Failure.       Summed up in one word:
                           FAIT
             Vanessa...
                     (then, trying)
             He has the stones. There's      no reason
             to keep her. Hell, she's a      little
             girl, she's eight years old     -- she
             can't hurt him. He can let      her go...
             He can just fucking let her     go...
Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait
knows it, too.
It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
                           FAIT
             ... What the hell am I gonna do?
                           SU
             ... We need to go.
Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,
and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the
fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of
exotica, destroying it.
Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then --

                                                            74.
                         SU
          Come on.
OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go...


INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
Ling pours the black stones out on a table.   To Sona and
Charles --
                        LING
          We're back in business.
                       CHARLES
          Good. I don't have to baby-sit much
          longer.
                         SONA
          I hate kids.
                        LING
          Is everything else ready?
                        SONA
          We just have to test the device.
Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption
nearby, speaks up.
                         RUSSELL
          Dye master oscillator. And not test,
          calibrate. Which I'm now ready to
          do... Goggles.
When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.   And...
Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin
bombarding a sensor. OFF which...

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her
wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly    rips the tape from her
mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries     to figure out what to do
next. Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help
her escape or fight. When...
Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An
old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out
exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and...
The phone turns on.    Sort of.

"Low Batt" flashes on the screen.
INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rock bottom.

Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.      Daria
tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help.
Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent.
Even Archie's quiet for once.
The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese
to someone who is obviously his superior.

                        SU
          ... I lost the stones. Ling has
          them... I don't know where he is... I
          have no way to find him... What do
          you want me to do?
Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.    And...
Fait's too upset to care about answering.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa's on the old cell phone.    We hear RINGING on the
other end.
                        VANESSA
          ... Answer, Daddy, answer...

CLOSEUP - PHONE
"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...

INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The PHONE'S still RINGING.    After another moment...
                        MILES
          Want me to get that?
Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer.
                        MILES
          Hello.
INTERCUT WITH:

                                                               76.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa whispers urgently.
                         VANESSA
          Daddy?
                         FAIT
          Vanessa!
Which gets everyone's attention.
                         VANESSA
          Come get me!   Please!   I want to go
          home!

                        FAIT
          Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.
Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his
superior. Still in Chinese --
                        SU
          I'll call you back.
                         FAIT
                  (continuing, to
                   Vanessa)
          Where are you?
                        VANESSA
          I don't know. I'm in a van inside a
          big building. They painted the
          windows. I can't look out.
                         FAIT
          Try.   Try to see something.
Vanessa puts her eye to the window.    Finally finds a small
gap in the paint.

VANESSA'S POV
Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from
Russell's contraption.

                                                77.
                          VANESSA
          I see chairs.    And there's green
          light.
Fait repeats for the others' benefit.

                        FAIT
          You see chairs and green light?
          Where's the light coming from?
                          VANESSA
          I can't tell.
                          SU
          Is it bright?

                        FAIT
          The green light, baby -- is it
          bright?
                         VANESSA
          Yeah.   Really, really bright.
                        FAIT
                  (to Su)
          It's real bright.
                          VANESSA
          Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared!
                          FAIT
          I know, baby.    Just hang in there

END INTERCUT.
                        FAIT
          ... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit!
Fait slams the phone down in frustration.
But Su's mind is on what she told them.
                        SU
          ... He's doing it here.    Tonight.

                                                  78.
                        TOMMY
          What?
                         SU
          Selling the stones... A dye laser
          emits green light. He needs it to
          activate them.
                        MILES
          What the hell you talking about?
                        DARIA
          What are these stones?
Archie answers it.

                        ARCHIE
          Doomsday in disguise.
All eyes go to him.
                         ARCHIE
          They're some kinda new synthetic
          plutonium. Small and portable, but
          mega-powerful.
                        TOMMY
          This fucker's making bombs?
                        SU
          Not making them.
                        ARCHIE
          Yeah, he'd need a big operation for
          that. Why bother? Just demonstrate
          the stones work and sell 'em to
          whichever international scumbag
          offers the highest bid. He makes
          millions, they make the bombs,
          then... 'look out, world.'
                        FAIT
          ... Okay, so we know what he's up to.
          How's it get us to Vanessa?
Su considers it a moment.
                        SU
          The buyers will want to arrive and
          leave quickly... Somewhere private...
          Accessible by aircraft.
                        FAIT
          Vanessa said she's inside a big
          building. Could be a hangar.

                                                             79.
                        MILES
          Man, there's dozens of little
          airports around here. We'd never get
          to 'em all.
                        SU
          ... Flight plans.
                        ARCHIE
          Hey, yeah. Flight plans show
          destinations. All aircraft file 'em
          with the Aviation Administration. If
          we could get a list, we could maybe
          figure out where the sale's going
          down.

                        FAIT
          ... Daria, call the aviation people.
          Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We
          need flight plan info for all private
          aircraft in this area tonight...
          Everyone else get ready to move...
          Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked.
          You break out the heat... Tommy, you
          gotta get us a diversion.
                        ARCHIE
          I can help with that.
                        FAIT
          ... Do it all fast.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell.
Russell finishes testing his contraption.    Switches it OFF.
Then, removing his goggles --
                        RUSSELL
          We're operational.
The others remove their goggles.    Sona checks her watch.
                        SONA
          The buyers arrive in less then an
          hour.
Beat.   Ling holds up a black stone and examines it.
                        LING
          ... So small. So deadly... We're
          selling conscience for money...
A look at the others.   Serious.   Then a broad smile of

                                                             80.
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face.
                         LING
           ... But it's a lot of money...
Beat.   He puts down the stone.    A glance at the camper.

                         LING
           Be ready to kill the girl and go as
           soon as the sale's over.

           Sounds like our best shot.
                         FAIT
           .. It better be, or my baby's dead.
He and Su exchange a look.     Then --

           Let's go.

CORPORATE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other
high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the

Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the

                                                            81.

An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying
the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly
muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new
arrivals.

In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are
five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one
EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.
Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one
to three bodyguards.
Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...
Charles standing nearby.    Too close for her to escape.

Charles turns, and...

BACK TO VANESSA
Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the
window.
There's no way out.

EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Driving.   Daria and Miles following in their car.
                         FAIT (V.O.)
           So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan
           fit into all this?
                         SU (V.O.)
           One of our scientists made the
           stones. Tried to go into business
           for himself. We stopped him.
           Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed
           us. He took them.
                          FAIT (V.O.)
           Ling?   He was one of you?
                         SU (V.O.)
           We were partners. Six of us. He
           killed the others. He thought he
           killed me, too.
                          FAIT (V.O.)
                   (beat)
           So what're you really after -- the
           stones or the payback?
                         SU

                                                            82.
          Both.
                        FAIT (V.O.)
          ... Yeah... Let's get it all.


INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
                        LING
          You're the world's foremost arms
          dealers. You all know that weaponry
          equals power. And in the world of
          weaponry, nukes rule.
                        (MORE)
                        LING (CONT'D)
          But nuclear material is hard to
          obtain and difficult to handle... But
          what if it weren't?... That's the
          question that brought you here
          tonight... And here's the answer.
Ling holds up a single stone.
                        LING
          In its present state, it's completely
          inert. Zero radiation, zero
          volatility...
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard
with a mallet.
He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces.
Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who
places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then
inserts the capsule into his contraption.
                         RUSSELL
          Goggles on.
Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and
the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
of stone, which begins to glow.
Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical
readout on the contraption races up the scale --
                        RUSSELL
          ... Firecracker... .44 magnum...
          R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD...
          Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter...
          Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas...
And it just keeps going.   Until, finally --

                                                             83.

                         RUSSELL
           ... New World Order.
As the buyers absorb this...

Russell shuts off the beams.
                           RUSSELL
           Goggles off.
Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who
holds it up.
                            LING
           One small    fragment. Transformed into
           a source    of immense energy. More
           powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium
           a hundred    times its size.
A beat as this sinks in.
                         SONA
           The purpose of today's sale is to
           begin trading a new commodity on the
           black market and establish its
           value... There are fifty stones
           available in the first sale. The
           opening price is one million per
           stone... Bids, please?
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand
signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the
same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.
Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a
laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-
analysis for Sona to consult.
The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel
out the situation.
                         RUSSIAN BUYER
           Five at one million.
Sona is silent.   Silence means "No."
                         AFRICAN BUYER
           Five at one-point-two.
Silence.
                         PAKISTANI BUYER

           We'll take that.
                         FRENCH BUYER
           Six at one-five.
Silence.

                         EGYPTIAN BUYER
           Ten at two million.
Silence.

           Sale's at this end... There's a

           Five-two.
When suddenly...
KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and
into the hangar.
Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same
time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted
machine gun on the stunned group.
                         TOMMY
           Freeze, motherfuckers!

                                                             87.
Russell watches the advancing tank.
                           RUSSELL
            I knew it!   I knew it!


ANGLE - BEHIND TANK
Fait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the
Abrams for shelter.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's
happening.


VANESSA'S POV
Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.

BACK TO VANESSA
She looks back into the camper. Finds a heavy iron skillet
amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And...
SMASH!    She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.

MILES' SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
We FIND Vanessa, jumping out of the camper.
                          MILES (V.O.)
            Vanessa's out of the camper.   Running
            this way.

INT. HANGAR - FAIT AND DARIA
To Daria --
                          FAIT
            Stay.
And he's gone, sprinting after her just as...

VANESSA
reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar
doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to
motor open.

                                                              88.

CHARLES
hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.    Turns.   Sees Vanessa and
goes after her.


SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs.
                          MILES (V.O.)
          She's out.
Then, FINDING Charles coming after her --

                        MILES (V.O.)
          There's a guy after her.
PHUT!

INT. HANGAR - CHARLES
A BULLET rips through the collar of his leather coat. Just
behind his neck. Just missing him. But he keeps coming.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Charles rolling out under the door.

MILES
SHOOTS again.   PHUT!

CHARLES
The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In
a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness
of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside...

INT. HANGAR
In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes
its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy
sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.
                          TOMMY
          Just be cool!
At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.

                                                             89.
                        TOMMY
          I said don't move, motherfucker!
Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the
back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.
Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.
Russell vaults in and takes aim.
                        RUSSELL
          Fucking amateurs!
He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take
big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.
                        TOMMY
          Shit!   What do we do?

                          ARCHIE
          Shoot back!
                          TOMMY
          How?
The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right
thing. And...
Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-
TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the
gun's more in control of him. But...
Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.
                        ARCHIE
          Twin .50's some major firepower.
          How'd that little shit get one?
                          TOMMY
          Motherfucker.    Couldn't fucking
          listen.
INTERCUT WITH which...

ACROSS HANGAR
Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the
stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.
Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...
Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly
takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
the gun on Su.
Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees

                                                              90.
Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he
signals --
                        SU
          Don't let him get away!

As a result of which...

TOMMY AND ARCHIE
Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
away.


LIMO
Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
INTERCUT WITH which...

SU AND SONA
Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When...
WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
limo
                          DARIA
          Get him.
Su goes after Ling.
And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
through her chest and kills her.
And now, here's what's been going on outside...

EXT. AIRFIELD

                                                                91.

As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...

MILES

flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And...

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is
closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!


CHARLES
The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed
but keeps going.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas
truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.

MILES
sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms
Fait.
                        MILES
          Lost 'em behind the gas truck.

CHARLES
stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No
sign of her. Until...
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
the way. He whips it open. And...
There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.
                        CHARLES
          Time to end this my way.
And then...
                        FAIT (O.S.)
          Drop the girl.

                                                              92.

Charles looks over.    Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.
                          FAIT
          Put her down.
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her.
                          VANESSA
          Daddy!
Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...

Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
unstoppable force.
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
struts.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Fait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.

MILES
comms Fait.
                          MILES
          No shot.

FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA
The fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
attack. When...
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.
Charles moves in. And...
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
a length of nylon rope.
Fait turns to Vanessa.

                                                            93.
                         FAIT
          Don't move.
Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
Charles. Tosses the chocks down.
                          FAIT
          Wrong kid.    Wrong dad.

Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...

EXT. HANGAR
Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away.
The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
bodyguard.
Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
                         LING
          Go!

EXT. HANGAR
Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.

EXT. AIRFIELD
The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the
helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just
in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.

                                                                 94.
EXT. AGUSTA
As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to
get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,
he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.


INT. AGUSTA
Ling hears the THUMPS.    Looks out.

LING'S POV - SU'S LEG
swinging beneath the Agusta.


LING
To the pilot --
                          LING
            Retract the gear!

CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL
The pilot hits the wheels-up switch.     And...

SU
The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of
the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
                          SU
            Shoot it down!   Now!
And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
As...
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.

INT. TANK
Archie aims the cannon.
                          TOMMY
            Can you hit it?
                           ARCHIE
            No problem.   Absolutely... Load.
Tommy slides a shell into the breech.

                                                                95.

Archie's locked on.     He hits the trigger.   And...

ABRAMS TANK

BOOM!   The big CANNON FIRES.      And...

SKY
The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.

INT. TANK

Archie and Tommy exult.
                          TOMMY
            Shot him right in the ass.
                           ARCHIE
            I did it.   I can't believe it.
                          TOMMY
            Thought you said it was no problem.
                          ARCHIE
            What do I know?

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
crashing.

EXT. AIRFIELD
The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
INTO FLAMES.
The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With
Su in the middle.
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
Su is waiting.
                          LING

                                                          96.
          You were lucky last time.   You
          Won't be lucky again.
The final fight begins.
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
                        LING
          I'll kill you fast.    You won't
          Feel a thing.

                          SU
          ... I won't.    You will
What happens next happens in an instant:
Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it.
A direction it can't go.
Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Ling's pocket. And...
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
                        SU
          This is for our friends.
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...

INSIDE LING'S THROAT
The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once.
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...

ANGLE BACK ON LING

                                                             97.

As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out.
Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
skeleton. Human jerky.
In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
topple over. Su has closed a chapter.

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in
b.g.
The two men regard each other a moment.
                         FAIT
          We got it all.
                  (then)
          What happens to the stones?
                        SU
          They'll be destroyed.
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive
in b.g.
                        FAIT
          Looks like I'll be doing some jail
          time.
                       TOMMY
          Jail? Man, you just helped save the
          planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
A look between Fait and Su.   Su nods.
                        SU
          I'll do what I can.
                        ARCHIE
          That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a
          helluva team, y'know?
                  (to Su)
          Well, not you, 'cause you're law
          enforcement. But the rest of us
          -- look, a white guy comes in handy
          now and then. Y'know, if you're
          pulling a job in Beverly Hills or
          ripping off a country club or
          whatever... What kind of percentage
          are we talking?

                                                                98.

                         FAIT
          We're not.
Fait looks at Vanessa again.     Finding a new purpose in her
eyes. Beat.

                        FAIT
          Time I got real.
He regards the others.
                        FAIT
          Time we all did.
                          ARCHIE
          Get real?    What's that mean?
                        TOMMY
          ... Means we're through with that
          life.
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.     Beat.   Tommy nods.
Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
                        DARIA
          I'm with you, T.
He looks to Miles.
                        MILES
          Whatever you say, man.
Fait looks back to Su.   They hold the look.
                         SU
          ... Good luck.
                         FAIT
          ... Faith.
Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the
arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and
Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
                        ARCHIE
          What, you're all gonna go straight,
          just like that?
                        TOMMY
          Maybe oughta try it yourself.
                        ARCHIE
          Me? Are you kidding? I've had
          straight jobs. You ever had a

          straight job?
                        TOMMY
          I had plenty of straight jobs.
                          ARCHIE
          Name one.
                        TOMMY
          I sold Avon door-to-door.
                        ARCHIE
          ... You were an Avon lady?
                        TOMMY
          I was an Avon man. You got a problem
          with that?
                        ARCHIE
          No, it's just, well, uh...
                         TOMMY
          Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
                  (then)
          But my momma did it, and don't you
          dare start disrespecting my momma...
And so on... OFF which, we...

               We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around
               the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND
               FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it.

                            of watching you squirm out your last

               in an offhanded way. All of the background noise - the

               Finding a drunken man's strength, CHEV flips out. He rips
               the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF
               THE WALL. He launches it straight into the floorboards with
               a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH.
          
               He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system, JUMPS on

               ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through the
               apartment and down the hall.
          
               By the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it:
               his God-damned CELL PHONE. Of course it stops ringing just
               as he picks it up. He pockets it, BANGS OPEN the front door
               and is out.

               walks right over it and hops off, clicking the keyless lock
               button on his chain in mid-air ... the door to his BLACK AUDI
               pops open ... he gets in.

          CHEV finds himself nodding off in the car ...
          
          The CAMERA ZOOMS back into his chest. This time it becomes
          COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - we see his HEART BEAT SLOW DOWN:
          
          SOUND - BOOMING: ... LUB DUB, LUB DUB...
          
          The CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE
          GAS... then back up to the HEART as the ADRENALINE CRANKS HIM
          UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP -
          
          SOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..!
          
          ... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems
          to come to his senses.
          
          CHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the
          cigarette adapter. Four rings. Finally someone picks up.

               drinking, etc. CHEV BARGES IN, drawing a GLOK .45 from his
               coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better
               dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of
               BADASSES.

          in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's
          head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming.
          The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of
          bloody violence.
          
          Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice.
          
                               ORLANDO
                     THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!   THE WHITE MAN IS
                     COOL!
          S
           ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping.
          
                               ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                         (calmly)
                     Can we all just get along?   Can we?
          
          Beat.   CHEV'S gun is still trained on ORLANDO'S head.
          
                               ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                     Now Chevy here has something he would
                     like to discuss. So we are going to
                     discuss it. In a civilized manner.
                     Chevy? I believe you had a question, or
                     some point you were trying to make?
          
                               CHEV
                     Where's Verona.
          
                              ORLANDO
                     OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky
                     Verona.
          
                               CHEV
                         (starting to lose it again)
                     You pulled the Anselmo job together,
                     don't try to bullshit me ...
          
          He presses closer to ORLANDO ... the BROTHERS bristle ... the
          situation is close to blowing up again.
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                              ORLANDO
                    Easy ... easy ... now things are
                    beginning to clarify ... you see how that
                    works? How discussion can lead to
                    clarity?
          
           HEV is running out of patience.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Clearly you are operating under a false
                    pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did
                    not "pull the Anselmo job together." In
                    fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the
                    Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes
                    me seventy five hunna dollars.
          
                              CHEV
                    That's not how I heard it.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    But that's the way it is. That's the way
                    it is. So you see, I don't know where
                    Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where
                    he is, I would probably be there right
                    now, beating his Gucci ass down.
          S
           tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying
          ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating.
          
           hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's
          telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.
          
                               CHEV
                    Alright.
          
          The room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter
          amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit
          away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    Thank you. That's what I'm talking
                    about. That resembles civility.
          
          LUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB
          
          CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though
          he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds
          him up and shoves him away.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Shit dude, what's the matter with you?

                    Verona, that little bitch ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    I understand that. You've made that
                    point abundantly clear to all of us.
          
          He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of
          the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Now what can I do to help you?
          
                              CHEV
                    Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You
                    got any coke?
          
          ORLANDO gives him the look.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    OK, now you're insulting me.
          
                              CHEV
                    Come on, man, I know you got coke.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    You think every brother is carrying, is
                    that it?
          
                              CHEV
                    Come on, I don't have time for this, just
                    give me something ... I'm really dying
                    here ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    I can see that.
          
                              CHEV
                    No. You don't understand, I'm really
                    fucking dying ... if I don't ...
                        (losing it again)
                    May I just have some coke, please?
          
                              ORLANDO
                    So this is medicinal use coke, that's
                    what you're telling me.
          
                              CHEV
                    That's right.

                              ORLANDO
                    You got something for me, or what?
          
          CHEV shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens,
          tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading.
          
          ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little
          plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The
          bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.
          CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the
          floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.
          
          CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it
          right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The
          BROTHERS find this hilarious.
          
          ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Chevy ... come on, man...
          
          We hear CHEV'S heart rate start to build, increase in volume.
          
          Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls,
          steadies himself. A new man.
          
                              CHEV
                    OK, that's good.    That's good.
          
                               RLANDO
                    Oh that's good, right?
          
          CHEV pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his
          beating heart.

               CHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the
               room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then,
               without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S
               face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all

               All hell breaks loose.
          
               EXT OUTSIDE THE BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
           1                                                                  21
               A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it,
               single door closed.
          
               SUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of
               the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been
               thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a
               cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk.
          
               A second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is
               tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a
               jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The
               BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down.
          
               STILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22
          22
               HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE
               STREET, LAUGHING MANIACALLY, HEART POUNDING LIKE A
               JACKHAMMER.

               Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating
               hard, panting with adrenaline.

                more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up
                behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to
                "PULL OVER" out of its intercom.
          
                 HEV goes evasive, leading the cop on a HIGH SPEED CHASE.

           heir heads rise just above the water, like heads on a
          platter. Several jittery BODYGUARDS stand at the edge of the
          pool, guns drawn. With a simple motion of his hand, CARLITO
          calms them.

                                 CARLITO
                       I'm surprised to see you.
          
                                 CHEV
                       Well, something urgent has come up.
          
                                  CARLITO
                       Ha!   So I've heard.
          
                                 CHEV
                       Then you know what happened?
          
                                 CARLITO
                       Word travels fast.     You amaze me, my

                       What can I say. Look, Carlito, I need
                       your help. I don't have much time.

               down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab
               waiting out front.
          
               The same ARAB CABBIE is waiting inside.

               CHEV goes to the driver side of the car, pulls the CABBIE out
               of the cab and tosses him into the road. The lunch crowd at
               the cafe, passerbys, etc., look on in bewilderment. CHEV
               points at the CABBIE and starts screaming ...

               ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they

               caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life -
               drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes.

               BUTCHER KNIFE.

               closed. He advances.
          
               The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings
               the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and
               tries to peer around it into the alley.
          
               Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the
               BUTCHER KNIFE.
          
                efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and
               neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun
               and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and

               front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that

                       get out of you ...
          A
           LEX rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws
          himself at CHEV. HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and
          lands on him with his full weight.
          
          CHEV is pinned. ALEX, enraged, attempts with some success to
          strangle him with his remaining hand. CHEV struggles in
          futility, heart hammering. It seems hopeless ...
          
          ... until KAYLO appears behind ALEX with a ROLLING PIN and
          brings it down on his skull with a LOUD CRACK.
          
          ALEX rises up, staggering, and advances on KAYLO, who drops
          the ROLLING PIN and cowers amidst the trash cans.
          
          CHEV gets to his feet, pulls out his gun, puts it to the back
          of ALEX'S head.
          
          CHEV pulls the trigger twice.
          
          CLICK. CLICK.

          He tosses it away and stumbles to the back door of the
          restaurant as ALEX proceeds to beat KAYLO down with a
          trashcan, swinging it one handed.
          
           HEV picks up ALEX'S disconnected hand, which is still
          clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He
          uses ALEX'S finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him
          away. ALEX hits the ground with a THUD.

                       Jesus ... nothing's easy ...
          
          He pries the gun from ALEX'S cold, dead fingers, shoves it in
          his pocket and tosses the hand to a disgusted KAYLO, who
          tries to get away from it ...

                       Yes!    Yes ... that's it ... you have it?
          
                                  HARMACIST
                       I can't give you epinephrine.
          
                                   CHEV
                       Why?

          She walks into the back.        Through the glass he sees her pick
          up a phone.

               bottles.

                         It's got epinephrine in it.   Get you
                         tweaked, man.
          
               CHEV looks from the kid to the display and back, then through
               the glass window, where the PHARMACIST is talking to someone
               on the telephone, looking out at him suspiciously.
          
               He picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets
               out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes
               him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him.

               CHEV wanders through the trauma ward, trying to look
               inconspicuous, avoiding eye contact, knocking things over,
               trying doors, inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray,
               tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering.
          
               He rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks: three COPS are
               at the admissions counter ... a NURSE is gesturing in CHEV'S
               direction. They look up toward him.
          
               He ducks back into the corridor, finds a recovery room and
               slips in.

               The room is quiet, save for the steady labored wheezing of an
               OLD MAN in the only bed. The OLD MAN'S eyes stare vacantly
               at the ceiling - CHEV can't tell if he's asleep or awake. He
               watches the OLD MAN for a stolen moment, hypnotized ...
          
                .. then glances over at the half open closet.

               The COPS come up on the corridor where CHEV disappeared.
               They advance, hands on weapons, checking each room.
          
                hey reach CHEV'S room. The door is slightly ajar.     One of
               the cops pushes it open with his foot.
          
               The OLD MAN is there, motionless.   No sign of CHEV.

               The COPS continue down the hall. Behind them, from the door
               they checked, CHEV tiptoes out wearing a blue hospital
               johnnie, tied in the back with his ass hanging out, trying to
               blend in.
          
               One of the COPS notices this.

                            Hey!
          
               CHEV takes off, walking faster, around the corner.        The COPS
               head after him.
               T
                he COPS turn the corner.        CHEV is still trying to play it
               off.

                            Hey.   You.
          
               Finally CHEV breaks into a run and the COPS give chase.

               CHEV busts into the stairwell and starts heading down. He's
               been holding his gun awkwardly in his armpit; now he whips it
               out. A few flights above he hears the door bang open as the
               COPS pick up the chase.
          
               He exits into the ...

               The busy ER is buzzing with activity. CHEV looks around
               desperately. The COPS are right on his tail.
          
               Suddenly the entrance doors BURST OPEN ... a patient is
               wheeled in at a dead run by a small group of emergency TECHS,
               all shouting instructions back and forth and barking at
               people to get out of the way as they race toward the far
               corridor. The FAT MAN on the gurney has his shirt open ...
               he's pale, glassy eyed and lathered in sweat ... they have
               the DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES out ...
               B
                ehind the gurney a RESIDENT pushes a CRASH CART along with
               them ... the crash cart houses the DEFIBRILLATOR and various
               supplies ...
          
               CHEV takes off after them, BOWLING PEOPLE OVER, flashing the
               gun.

                       Hold it right there, bro!
          
          The group is galloping      down the long corridor toward the
          elevators that connect      to the O.R. ... three DOCS, the
          RESIDENT, CHEV and the      FAT MAN on the gurney ... the COPS in
          hot pursuit, trying to      get a bead on CHEV.
          
          CHEV is holding his gun to the RESIDENT'S head while pushing
          him and the cart forward. The RESIDENT blubbers in panic.
          The DOCS, in all the confusion, haven't noticed CHEV yet.
          
                                 CHEV
                       You've got epinephrine on this cart!    I

                       He's dropping! Stand by to defibrillate!
          
          The gurney slows down and the cart, shoved forward by CHEV,
          crashes into it. Bodies fly, shit spills everywhere. The
          FAT MAN lets out a groan, makes EYE CONTACT with CHEV.

                       Yeah, yeah.
          
          CHEV spins around wildly and FIRES A FEW SHOTS over the COPS
          heads. They hit the deck.

          CHEV brandishes the gun toward the COPS to keep them on the
          ground, then motions C the RESIDENT.

          CHEV is pale as a ghost ... his legs buckle ... he steadies
          himself against the wall.

                    right?
          
          CHEV nods weakly. The RESIDENT, on his hands and knees,
          starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the
          floor. The COPS, sensing weakness, start to tense. CHEV
          snaps out of it momentarily.
          
                              CHEV
                    DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
          
          The RESIDENT approaches him cautiously, on his knees, holding
          out a handful of small white boxes.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Give me that.
          
          He snatches them, cradling them against his stomach, and
          backs up past the DOCS toward the elevator just as the chime
          sounds and the doors slide open. He tosses the boxes inside.
          The FAT MAN lets out another agonized groan.
          
                               AT MAN
                    ... asshole...
          
          CHEV points the gun at him.
          
                              CHEV
                    Not going to tell you again.
          
          He grabs a DEFIBRILLATOR paddle out of TECH 2's trembling
          hands and holds it to his chest.

               pinball. The COPS leap forward, trying to take advantage,
               but CHEV pops back up, wired and wild eyed.

                         GET DOWN, ASSHOLES!
          
               He FIRES ANOTHER WARNING SHOT into the ceiling and leaps into
               the elevator as the doors close behind him.

               CHEV collapses on the floor of the elevator. He fumbles with
               the white boxes the RESIDENT handed him and comes up with a
                                    C

               He rubs his arm, feeling for a nice vein, squirts a few drops
               from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in ...
               pushes the plunger ALL THE WAY, plucks it out and tosses it
               in the corner.
          
               CHEV sits patiently against the wall, staring blankly
               straight ahead. Suddenly a curious look comes over him.

               Suddenly he jumps straight up in the air.

                TV alpha state thing ...
          
                CHEV shakes his head, snaps out of it. His HEARTBEAT, barely
                audible during the broadcast, swells back to full volume,
                beating like a jackrabbit's.

                With a last look at the TV drones he breaks from the crowd
                and goes into stealth mode, darting from car to car in an
                exaggerated ninja crouch, trying to sneak up on the COP.

               He comes up behind him, transfers his gun and cell phone to
               one hand, and - heart POUNDING - reaches stealthily for the
               COP'S holster with the other.
          
               CAR HORNS BLARE as motorists attempt to warn the COP, who
               flinches and whips around at the noise - but it's too late:
               CHEV has the gun.
          
               He begins to hop around maniacally, taunting the COP, as
               everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic
               snarl, SLAMMING INTO FENDERS, driving up onto the sidewalk,
               etc.
          
                                      CHEV
                                (tossing the gun up and
                                 catching it)
                            You want it? You want this?
          
                he COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but
               jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up
               like a fetch stick, gluing the COP'S eyes, then flings it 40
               feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain.
          
                he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV
               dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He
               kicks up the stand and REVS IT.
          
                                      COP
                            You son of a bitch!
          
               The COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as
               the bike jerks forward.
          
                HEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on,
               dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like
               buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT,
               kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then
               jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing,
               dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails
               out.

               From the rear pegs at about 30 mph he JUMPS UP TO THE GAS
               TANK, feet first, STANDS STRAIGHT UP ON THE MOVING BIKE and
               puts his hands out to his sides in a Jesus Christ pose,

               Stunned silence hangs in the air; a few food-covered people
               wander around in dazed shock. CHEV'S arm, hand still
               clutching his cell phone, sticks out from under a table. The

          He pulls her toward him and kisses her. She accepts the kiss
          gratefully enough with her mouth, but holds both hands out to
          her sides as if touching the JOGGING SUIT would kill her.
          
          Without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into
          the apartment, looking around everywhere, paranoid.
          
                                 EVE
                       Is this your new look or something?
          
                                 CHEV
                       That's right. You into it?
          
                                 EVE
                       It's ... completely appalling.    Very you,
                       Chev.

                       Thank you.
          
          He checks into the bedroom, satisfies himself that it's
          empty.
          
                                 EVE

                       You haven't turned on the TV today,
                       right?
          
                                    EVE
                       No.   Why?
          
                                 CHEV
                       Didn't think so.    Listen, we've got to
                       get out of here.

                       such a freak.
          
          CHEV goes to the window, peaks through the curtains.
          
                                 EVE (CONT'D)
                       Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you
                       change the clock on the microwave?

                    Yeah. I never changed it back.   You

                    That's sweet. Are you OK? You look like
                    you're on drugs or something.

                              CHEV
                    Then I need you to do something for me.

                              CHEV
                    I need you to put some clothes on and
                    come with me right now.

                              CHEV
                    I'll change the clock on the microwave.
          
                              EVE
                    OK.
          
          Confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change.
          
          CHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window,
          looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up
          and punches two buttons.
          
          EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the
          clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18-
          wheeler being dragged on it's side through a cathedral.
          
           HEV'S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head
          pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up.

          We hear his HEART skip, hang for a long moment, then thud
          again, heavily.
          
                               HEV

                    Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on
                    if you want to make one.

                    Great, great ...
          
          He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an
          old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting
          to smoke.
          
          He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND
          PRESSES THE THING CLOSED.
          
           OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE.
          
           e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in
          agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out
          his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping
          up and down.
          
                              EVE (O.S.)

                    Yes. No! ... thanks ...
          
          The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it
          out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a
          ribbon in her hair.

                HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the
               window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better
               look.
          
          
          
               A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split

               up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each
               one has a right hand tucked into his blazer - they're
               PACKING.

               EVE stops suddenly in front of her door - CHEV practically
               PILES into her.

                he opens the door and walks in. CHEV tries to speak, coughs
               up some unintelligible stacato nonsense.

               The door SLAMS OPEN. The HOOD whirls to see CHEV, grim as a
               motherfucker, SIX INCHES FROM HIS FACE. He scrambles for his
               gun -
          
                OO LATE. CHEV'S hand flashes forward, PALM connecting with
               the BRIDGE OF THE NOSE - dropping him instantly.
          
                                    VE (O.S.)

                         Hello? Hello? Alright, very funny...
          
               The HOOD drops to his knees, eyes rolling back in his head,
               blood rushing from his nose. CHEV glances quickly around for
               witnesses - then backs into the hallway, letting the door
               swing shut behind him.

               CHEV is waiting by the door, blocking her view of the front
               entrance, smiling somewhat crazily.
          
                                   CHEV
                         You trying to burn down the building?
          
               She gives him a look, then turns and heads down the hall.
               CHEV hustles after her.

                he building opens out back into a small parking area. Trash
               bins line the brick wall, ready for pick up. CHEV and EVE are
               leaving when CHEV sees the other HOOD coming around the
               corner, LESS THAN TEN FEET AWAY.
          
               CHEV grabs the back of EVE'S purse and turns it upside down,
               spilling the contents all over the concrete. She spins
               around, just missing C

               She drops down to gather up her things, as the HOOD comes
               fully around the corner and MEETS EYES with CHEV.
          
                ithout hesitation, CHEV hurdles EVE and catches the HOOD'S
               wrist as he pulls out his GUN.

                            working for you...
          
               CHEV wrestles himself around the HOOD, keeping the gun at a
               distance with one hand, his other hand cupped over the HOOD'S
               mouth, head-locking him. Their legs interlock, jostling for
               leverage.
          
                he GUN drifts down toward EVE - CHEV wrenches it up as THE
               TRIGGER SQUEEZES.
          
               SILENCER. The shot whizzes over EVE'S head and through a

               CHEV shoves the HOOD'S body into a dumpster just as EVE
               turns... CHEV snatches up the first thing he sees - a grime
               encrusted plastic SHOWER CAP - and holds it up lamely.

               EVE storms out of the restaurant, letting the door slam
               behind her. CHEV follows, staggering like a drunk man.
          
               He catches up to her and grabs her arm.

          over to a newspaper machine on the street - the crowd parts
          to let them through - and bends her over it.

          portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause.
          CHEV picks up the pace. EVE begins making primal cries.
          
            busload of JAPANESE GIRLS pulls up - tourists in matching
          red uniforms - gaping out the window with slack jawed
          amazement.
          
           ith the crowd cheering and traffic stopped, CHEV gets a shot
          of adrenaline and goes for broke. EVE shrieks like a banshee

                elevator when CHEV appears behind them, taking everyone by
                surprise.
          
                 e's standing over KAYLO'S body, gun drawn, EVE'S beaded
                purse still slung over his shoulder, PISSING FIRE.
          
                                       CHEV
                             Alright, where is that motherfucker?
          
                The HOODS are completely taken by surprise; they back away
                from CHEV, spreading out.
          
                                        OOD #3
                             Uh ... hey, Chev.
          
                The HOODS act almost guilty ... it's obvious everyone knows
                each other.
          
                                       CHEV
                             What the fuck is this?

                CHEV points the gun at HOOD #1's head; the others raise their
                guns at him.
          
                                        HEV

                             Verona got nothing to do with this.

                       deal of embarrassment.
          
          CHEV gestures toward KAYLO in disbelief.
          
                                 CHEV
                       Carlito ordered this?

                       Look, forget about Verona. We'll take
                       care of him. The best thing for you to
                       do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place
                       and just ... die.

                       Yeah.   Just ... die.
          
          CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to slow. The wooden elevator starts
          down. He looks around, making eye contact with the other
          HOODS ...
          
                                 CHEV
                       Maybe you're right.
          
          ... then down to KAYLO'S crumpled body. He sees the stocking
          feet, the pumps ... his HEART starts to jitter - THUDUB ...
          LUB ... THUDUB ... his vision doubles ... he starts to swoon
          ...

          HOOD #1 snickers.     The others share a tense laugh.
          
                                 CHEV

                CHEV brings up his gun in the blink of an eye, draws a bead
                on HOOD #1 and is about to set off a SHOOTING GALLERY, when
                the ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES and the door SLIDES OPEN.
          
                EVE WALKS IN... looks around, and FREEZES.
          
                They all turn to look.
          
                                    HOOD #1 (CONT'D)
                          What the...?
          
                CHEV affords himself about a second and a half of BUG-EYED
                SHOCK before snapping out of it and DROPPING HOOD #1
                INSTANTLY WITH A SHOT TO THE HEAD.
          
                 HAOS BREAKS OUT as the others dive for cover and start
                blasting. CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward
                the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft,
                grabbing EVE as he goes.
          
                 AYLO'S body screens CHEV and EVE as they run, taking hits,
                finally toppling over again. CHEV takes out another HOOD on
                the run, nailing him right between the eyes.
          
                 HEV turns his back on the hoods, covering EVE, as they make
                a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a BULLET IN THE
                ASS.
          
                                    CHEV
                          OW!
          
                He spins and empties his clip at the HOODS, who hit the deck.
          
                EVE holds his ass as CHEV looks down the open elevator shaft.
                The elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. He grabs
                EVE, then the cable... they jump for it.

                CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a
                CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor. The workers are all
                in a panic, standing by their sewing machines - they've
                obviously heard the shots. The SUPERVISOR is walking around,
                shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in
                Korean to keep working.

                man.

                in from the stairwell. They spot him.
          
                CHEV and EVE duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of
                machines toward the windows. The HOODS fan out. They play
                cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans
                while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and
                forcing the workers back into their chairs.
          
                CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily...
          
                ... then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves the
                HOOD'S gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at
                least fifty years old, operated by a Korean woman even older.
                THE RUSTY THING PUNCTURES HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AS HE
                SCREAMS, JUMPING UP AND DOWN, UNABLE TO GET FREE.
          
                 HEV grabs the gun. They make for the fire escape.

                They reach the bottom of the ladder and are PINNED DOWN by
                gunfire from above.
          
                CHEV gives her a LOOK that says it all.

                             I had to see if you were telling the
                             truth... oh, and you have my purse.
          
                CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off
                and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks
                cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire
                escape.

                       ... OK, now come on.
          
          EVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was
          avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs
          her hand and yanks her along.
          
          He spots EVE'S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and
          they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND
          RICOCHET off the pavement.
          
          EVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV
          assumes she's looking for the CAR KEYS.

          CHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a
          few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out
          onto the ground.

          She looks like she's about to wander around, gathering up her
          things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER
          WINDOW of the car.
          
          CHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD
          FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs
          around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT.

                           (head over heels IN LOVE)
                       No, I mean: that you were going to give
                       it all up for me.
          
                                   CHEV
                       Oh. Yeah.
          
                                 EVE
                       And the other part?
          
                                 CHEV
                       The poison? Yeah, that's true too.
          
           e SLAMS his fist against the wheel.
          
                                 EVE
                           (cracking)
                       Then... that means...
          
                                 CHEV
                       Pretty much.
          
                                 EVE
                       How can we stop it?
          
                                 CHEV
                       Adrenaline. It's the only thing that
                       slows it down.

                       So... when we were in Chinatown...?
          
                                 CHEV
                       Yeah. Sorry.
          
          A LOOK OF DETERMINATION comes over her. She reaches for his
          crotch.
          
                                 CHEV (CONT'D)
                       What are you doing?
          
                                 EVE

                              EVE
                    Come on, let's finish what you started.
          
          CHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He
          grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP -
          just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out
          the front.
          
          EVE'S head STAYS DOWN.
          
                                 CHEV
                    Oh boy...
          
          CHEV is straining against the seat, EVASIVE DRIVING as she
          GOES DOWN on him.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Oh yeah, that's... that's really working
                    for me...
          
          EVE'S head pops up. E
          
                               VE
                        (working him up)
                    You like that?
          
          Shots whiz by.
          
                                 CHEV
                    Stay down.
          
          He pushes her head back down.
          
          CHEV'S heart is POUNDING like a jackhammer. He's got himself
          arched into a crazy position, making it happen.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    That's it that's it that's it... just a
                    little...
          
          EVE'S head quickly pops back up. She PUSHES AWAY.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                        (flustered)
                    What's the matter?

                    So you can fall asleep like you always
                    do? I don't think so.

          CHEV loses his mind.
          
          He SLAMS THE BRAKES to put the car into a SLIDE, exposing his
          driver side to the pursuing sedan - punches his gun hand out
          the window and BLASTS AWAY.
          
          He NAILS THE DRIVER BETWEEN THE EYES... the window
          DISINTEGRATES... The SEDAN full of HOODS skids into the
          sidewalk. Steam pours from the radiator.
          
           XT. CITY STREET - DAY
          
          CHEV gets out and walks DIRECTLY UP TO THE SEDAN, one hand
          holding his gun straight out in front of him, the other
          PULLING UP HIS JOGGING PANTS, which are bunched up around his
          knees.
          
          CHEV unloads the entire clip into the SEDAN before any of the
          HOODS can react.
          
           e walks back to EVE'S CAR, cool as a cucumber, gets in and
          pulls away.
          
           NT. EVE'S CAR - DAY
          
          EVE'S face has turned a distinct shade of PALE GREEN.
          
                              EVE
                    Are they... OK?
          
          CHEV looks at her like she's nuts.
          
                              CHEV
                    They're dead.
          
          EVE is overwhelmed.
          
                              EVE
                    How can you... how can you do that...?
          
          CHEV barely hears her - he's become DISTRACTED, flexing his
          left hand and feeling around his legs.
          
                              CHEV
                    I told you, baby... I quit.
          
          He spots something, hits the brakes.
          
                                 CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Wait here.
          
          He jumps out.

                CHEV almost COLLAPSES when his feet hit the ground. It seems
                like the left half of his body has simply stopped working.
          
                                    CHEV
                          Jesus Christ! Now what...?
          
                He unsnaps the buttons of the warm-up pants to reveal that
                his left leg has TURNED GREY.
          
                He's HALF DEAD.
          
                                    EVE
                          What's the matter?
          
                                    CHEV
                              (pointing at her)
                          Stay.
          
                They've pulled up across the street from a HARDWARE STORE.
                CHEV drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the
                traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in.
          
                EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then
                pulls herself together and gets out.
          
                She follows CHEV'S path, crossing the street through traffic.
          
                 TORE EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS start bailing out of the store
                in a PANIC as she approaches the front doors. She walks
                through them and INSIDE.

                EVE dream-walks through the store, past the registers,
                following CHEV'S trail of BLOOD-SMEARED FOOTPRINTS.
          
                A pimple-faced STOCK CLERK blows by her, not looking back.
          
                                    STOCK CLERK
                          He's got a gun!
          
                She turns the corner and there's CHEV - he's propped up in
                the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of NAILS, HAMMER in
                one hand...
          
                 e's already hammered SIX FRAMING NAILS INTO HIS LEG and is
                busy POUNDING IN NUMBER SEVEN.
          
                He looks up at her, eyes wild.
          
          
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                EVE is speechless.
          
                SOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM.
          
                At first CHEV doesn't understand where the SOUND is coming
                from ... he looks around as if a RED GHOST might glide around
                a random corner any second ... then realizes his CELL is in
                his pocket. He answers it.

                From a distance, in a locked off TELEPHOTO frame, we see CHEV
                walking toward the CAMERA in slow motion, 100 f.p.s.
          
                Dialog from an UNSEEN CONVERSATION is layered over the image.

                                    CHEV (O.C.)
                          I know. But things have changed. There's
                          an antidote. I can make a deal for it,
                          but I've got to go alone.
          
                He's well dressed in a sportcoat, slacks, button down shirt
                and tie, flapping in the wind ... sunglasses, and look of
                brutal determination on his face ...
          
                                        VE (O.C.)
                          I'm scared.

                          Of course. But you'll be safe now. And
                          I'll be back.
          
                In a series of dissolves he comes straight at the CAMERA til
                his face fills the frame ...

                EVE looks up into CHEV'S eyes, absolutely vulnerable,
                absolutely STUNNING. Pale sunlight punches through the half
                rolled blinds.

                CHEV bangs through the revolving glass doors to the hotel.

                The CAMERA shifts to a ROUGH HANDHELD POV, similar to the
                shot that starts the film. The MUSIC is replaced by the
                SOUND of CHEV'S labored BREATHING and HEARTBEAT. The POV
                doubles, goes in and out of focus.
          
                 n one continuous shot he approaches the STANDARD HOTEL and
                walks past the valets into the RETRO-MOD LOBBY.

                The shot continues as CHEV moves through the LOBBY and makes
                a beeline for the RESTROOM. Scattered around are hard
                looking DUDES pretending to read newspapers ... he passes
                them by, avoiding eye contact.

                The bathroom is empty. He walks into a stall, shuts the door
                and opens his coat - we see a PAGER-SIZED device clipped to
                his belt - a green LED is illuminated.
          
                 EVERSE: CHEV adjusts a tiny knob on the device.   His face is
                shiny with perspiration.
          
                He pulls out his shirt tails ... we see that a small tube
                runs from the device to a needle inserted in the base of
                C
                spine, taped up with white adhesive.
          
                 HEV tucks the shirt back carefully, takes a series of deep
                breaths and leaves the stall.

                He bangs open the door to the restroom and pushes past three
                of the DUDES, who were about to go in. They let him pass,
                trying to avoid attention.
          
                CHEV makes his way to the ELEVATORS, hits the UP button.    The
                doors open, he gets on. The DUDES watch from the LOBBY.

                A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN - early 50s, compact and under five
                feet, immaculately groomed - hustles on as the doors slide
                shut. He stands opposite CHEV against the wall and stares at
                him, expressionless.

          CHEV takes a small bottle of PILLS from his coat pocket and
          swallows them dry.
          
          He closes his eyes and leans against the wall to steady
          himself as the effect of the pills washes over him.
          
           n UNEXPECTED VOICE breaks the silence.

          impassively.

          but the HALLUCINATION persists.

                       Tacs and balling some new asshole every

                    his life looking for the big thrill, the

                dimensional, computer animated GHOST, facing each other at
                opposite ends of the elevator.
          
                SOUND: the CHIME SOUNDS, signalling they've reached the top
                floor.

                 HEV glances at the lit floor number display, then back.
          
                The JAPANESE MAN stares back at him, blank.

                The JAPANESE MAN ignores him. When the doors open, he
                hustles off ... past two GOONS, who are waiting there for
                CHEV.
          
                They each take an arm.

                The GOONS lead CHEV through a posh dining area, down a dark
                corridor.
          
                They frisk him, finding the obvious .45 in the shoulder
                holster, yank it out and push him into a SMOKING LOUNGE.

                CARLITO and RICKY VERONA sit side by side at the table. An
                iced bucket of champagne, good cigars. GOONS chill in the
                corners. The whole floor has been cleared out - they've got
                the place all to themselves.

                       something.
          
          The GOONS give him another look. This time they reach down
          his pants and produce a second small, concealed handgun ...
          then discover the pager-like device. One of the goons rips
          the tube from CHEV's back - CHEV winces in pain. His
          HEARTRATE starts to slow almost immediately.
          
                                 CARLITO
                       Let me see that.
          
          A GOON tosses it to him.

          CARLITO shuts him up with a look.

          CARLITO unlatches a 2'x6" beautifully crafted mahogany wood
          case sitting on the table in front of him. It contains
          several SYRINGES and bottle of MILKY FLUID. He removes one
          SYRINGE from the box with a gloved hand. It almost glows in

          standing   at the entrance of the bar. He's got an ASIAN
          GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking,
          silenced   GLOCK .9mm.
          
          More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking
          position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed
          for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes
          are dead-blank COLD AS HELL.

          FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of
          ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another
          of CARLITO'S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his
          GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the
          bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets...
          
          VERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV...
          
           ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks
          the table forward, pinning VERONA'S legs to the bench - the
          ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV'S lap...
          
           e snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at
          VERONA'S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS... VERONA bobbles
          the .357... it hits the ground - GOES OFF - and the four
          fingers of VERONA'S right hand are VAPORIZED.
          
          VERONA SHRIEKS like a ten year old girl at a JUSTIN

          Behind the bar, CARLITO quickly punches up his cell phone.
          
                                CARLITO
                      Get me out of here! NOW!
          
          EXT. STANDARD HOTEL, ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          A PILOT is standing by in CARLITO'S personal HELICOPTER,
          waiting on the roof.
          
                                 PILOT
                      Yes sir.
          
          He fires her up, LIFTS OFF...
          
                                                                       99.

          CARLITO'S and DON KIM'S MEN have backed into opposite corners
          of the room, and are firing back and forth.
          
          VERONA crawls along the floor, gathering up what's left of
          his fingers... comes across a SYRINGE and grabs it in his
          teeth like a PIRATE'S KNIFE.
          
          DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.
          
                              CARLITO
                        (from behind the bar)
                    I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
          
                                CHEV
                    Too late!
          
          CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and
          pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA'S
          FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires -
          blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers.
          
          An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the
          BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO.
          
          CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265
          pounder - from behind...
          
                                CARLITO
                    Get down!
          
          He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of
          the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.
          
                              GOON
                    Thanks, boss.
          
          BOOM!
          
          The BIG GOON'S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both
          up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne,
          pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then
          drops back down with a THUD...
          
                              CARLITO
                    Ronnie James Dio...!
          
          The LOUNGE opens into a daylight drenched POOL AREA...
          CARLITO'S HELICOPTER drops down into view, roiling up the
          water...
          
          CARLITO makes a break for it.

                Still frame of a city street, traffic sounds - CAMERA down on
                the ground. A homeless guy ambles along, looks up, hustles
                his ass out of the way ...
          
                 ERONA hits the ground - SMACK! - BOUNCES, flies out of
                frame.
          
                Next is CHEV - he SLAMS off the canvas top of a moving
                convertible car - BAM!
          
                 HEV flies high out of frame, then comes down hard, smashing
                into a NEWS STAND right in front of the CAMERA ... TRADES and
                FISH WRAPS rain over CHEV and the surrounding area... on each

                A beat of silence... is that it?

               INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices.
               NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted.

                                       DANIEL
                               (whispering)
                          Turn on the flashlight.

                                         JULIEN
                          I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

                                       DANIEL
                          It has to work. You just bought it this
                          afternoon.

               A beat.

                                       JULIEN
                          Do they come with batteries?

                                       DANIEL
                          You didn't buy batteries?

                                       JULIEN
                          I thought they came with batteries.

                                       DANIEL
                          I can't believe you didn't check.

                                       JULIEN
                          I bought everything you put on the list.
                          Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight.
                          Batteries were not on the list.

                                       DANIEL
                          Why should I have to put it on the list?
                          It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

               

               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

               A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large
               homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in
               a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits
               nervously.

               

               INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

               Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,
               tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the
               flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places
               the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the
               wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut
               the canvas from the frame.
               Daniel rolls up the canvas.

               

                                                                          2.

               

                                          DANIEL
                          Let's go.

               Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.

                                       DANIEL
                          Be careful it's...

               Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans
               he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner
               of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.

                                          DANIEL
                          ... hot!

               Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins
               beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.
               Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He
               turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the
               fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.
               Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at
               him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it
               and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.

               

               INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT

               Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.

                                       DANIEL
                          Light your lighter. I can't see
                          anything... and try not to burn down
                          the house!

               Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills
               with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.

                                          OLD MAN'S VOICE
                          Don't move!

               They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in
               his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a
               very long, double-barrel shotgun.
               Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man
               slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down
               the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.
               Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the
               floor, motionless.

                                          JULIEN
                          Is he dead?

                                          DANIEL
                          I don't know.     He looks dead.

               

                                                                            3.

               

                                       JULIEN
                          He looked dead before he fell.

               The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun.
               Daniel and Julien run to the door.

               

               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Daniel and Julien run towards the street.

                                       DANIEL
                          Start the car! Start the car!

               Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street
               and get in the back seat.
               Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
               the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck
               between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.

               

               INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.

                                       JULIEN
                          You didn't think to move the car before
                          we came out!

               Daniel looks out his window and sees...
               DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun
               and heads towards the car.
               Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide
               down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the
               car shatter.

                                       DANIEL
                          Raymond, get us out of here!

               Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man
               opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..
               Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The
               engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.
               The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes
               and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take
               aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.

               

               INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT

               Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives.    Julien finds the
               whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Raymond)
                          You know what makes a good get away
                          driver?
                                       (More)

               

                                                                          4.

               
                                       DANIEL (Cont'd)
                               (controlled anger)
                          Being able to get away!

                                       RAYMOND
                          You're always pointing out my negative
                          qualities. My analyst says positive
                          reinforcement is a much more productive
                          way of relating with people.

                                       JULIEN
                          Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you
                          on how well you fucked up tonight.

               

               EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY

               A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks
               with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.

               

               INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The
               other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to
               the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter.
               As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring
               at him.

                                        MARCEL
                               (amused)
                          I heard you almost got your ass blown
                          off last night. Some thief. A regular
                          black panther.

               Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.

                                        RAYMOND
                          A Black Panther was a member of an African
                          American militant group in the sixties,
                          Marcel. I think you're referring to The
                          Pink Panther.

                                       MARCEL
                          Pink panther, black panther. Who gives
                          a shit? And I don't remember asking you
                          a God Damn thing, you little turd.

                                       RAYMOND
                          There's no reason to be abusive. You're
                          projecting your anger on me as a defense
                          mechanism.

                                       MARCEL
                          What the hell is he talking about?

                                       RAYMOND
                          I'm talking about human beings
                          communicating openly and honestly.

               

                                                                             5.

               

                                       MARCEL
                          How about getting on your knees and
                          communicating with my dick?

                                       BASTALDI
                          Shut up! Both of you!    You're giving me
                          a fuckin' headache.

               A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another.     We HEAR a muffled
               GROANING SOUND in the b.g.

                                       DANIEL
                          Where's your brother?

                                       BASTALDI
                          Vincent's in the States on business.
                               (a beat; referring to
                                the painting)
                          That it?

               Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk.
               Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art,
               just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes
               several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Okay.   Now I've got something I want to --

               We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He
               gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal
               a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth
               taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand
               on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.

                                       BASTALDI
                          Do you mind? I'm trying to do some
                          business here.

               The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles
               something.

                                       BASTALDI
                          One more sound out of you and I'm going
                          to cut your fuckin' tongue out.

               Bastaldi closes the door.   Daniel looks at him inquisitively.

                                       BASTALDI
                          You take someone in. Give them a steady
                          job and how do they repay you? By
                          claiming to misplace a shipment of your
                          merchandise.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Maybe he did misplace it.

                                       BASTALDI
                          You misplace your car keys.   You misplace
                          your cell phone.

                                       BASTALDI (Cont'd)
                          You do not misplace one hundred and forty
                          seven wide-screen TV's!

                                       DANIEL
                          Laurant, how long has he been in there?

               Bastaldi looks puzzled.

                                          BASTALDI
                          I don't know.     What day is today?

                                          JULIEN
                          Thursday.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Is it Thursday already?    This week has
                          just shot by.

               Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...

                                       BASTALDI
                          You and your crew speak English, don't
                          you?

               Daniel is still staring at the closet.

                                       BASTALDI
                          Hey Daniel! Hello?
                               (snaps his fingers)
                          Do you guys speak English?

                                          DANIEL
                          Uh, yeah.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Good.   I have a job for you in America.

               Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple.   He points
               to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.

                                       BASTALDI
                          The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich.
                          An acquaintance of mine recently quit
                          working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant.
                          She tells me they keep all their jewelry
                          in a safe in their bedroom.

                                       JULIEN
                          It seems like a long way to go for a
                          necklace.

                                       DANIEL
                          Besides, we don't know the city and--

                               (overlapping)
                          Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you
                          want to go.

                          He's telling you you're going! And if
                          he's telling you you're going to be going
                          then you are going to go!

                                       BASTALDI
                          Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely
                          redundant explanation.

                                       DANIEL
                          C'mon, Laurant, America?

                                       BASTALDI
                          The job is worth about two million euros.
                          Pull this off and you and your crew could
                          make some real money, Daniel. You leave
                          tomorrow.

               They know they don't have a choice.

                                       JULIEN
                          We're going to need to find someone who
                          knows the city.

                                       MARCEL
                          I know someone.

               

               EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY

               The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is
               SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,
               dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a
               MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.
               Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a
               vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the
               cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.
               Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She
               zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper
               catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the
               cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries
               to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.
               The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag
               away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the
               bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely
               in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and
               BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.
               He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when
               he sees...

               HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving
               towards him .
               He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing
               into the crowd.

               

                                                                           8.

               

               INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY

               Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the
               back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns
               around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile.
               NOTE:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.

                                        MARCEL
                           Going somewhere?

                                       SAMI
                           Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody
                           else. If I knew it was you I would have
                           never run.

               A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.

                                        SAMI
                           You're probably here for the money I owe
                           you.
                                (off Marcel's nod)
                           I don't have it.
               Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.

               

               INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

               Marcel closes the door.   He is face to face with Sami.

                                        SAMI
                           You know this is how rumors get started.

               Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A
               beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers
               inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning
               of a sexual act.

                                         SAMI
                           Told you.

               Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to
               his feet.

                                        MARCEL
                           Today's your lucky day, Sami.

                                        SAMI
                                (breathlessly)
                           Yeah, I can see that.

                                        MARCEL
                           Normally I'd be breaking your fingers
                           right now, but I'm going to give you a
                           chance to make enough to pay me back and
                           have some extra for yourself. We have a
                           group going to Chicago to do a job.
                           You're going with them.

               

                                                                            9.

               

                                          SAMI
                          Me?

                                       MARCEL
                          You lived there. You know the city.

                                       SAMI
                          I've still got a few legal problems back
                          in the States.

               Marcel glares at him.

                                       SAMI
                               (nervously)
                          But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.

               Marcel stares at him with hard expression.

                                       MARCEL
                          If you try to leave town I'll know. If
                          you manage to leave town I'll find you...
                          and the next time we meet in a bathroom
                          I'll be cutting you up into little pieces.

               He hands Sami a piece of paper.

                                       MARCEL
                          Be at this address at nine o'clock
                          tomorrow morning.

               

               INT. CAFE -- MORNING

               Daniel sits with Julien.    At the end of the bar Raymond is on the
               pay phone.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          Yes, Mama. Yes, I have my vitamins. I
                          have everything. Of course I'm coming
                          back. I'm not leaving you. I'm only
                          going to be gone a few days. I'll call
                          you when I get there. Okay? I've got
                          to go now.
                               (listens)
                          Mama, I've got to go.
                               (listens)
                          No, I'm not yelling.

               Sami enters and walks over to Daniel and Julien.

                                         SAMI
                          I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.

                                       JULIEN
                          What is it you do, Sami?

               

                                                                         10.

               

                                       SAMI
                          You know, a little of this, a little of
                          that. I've boosted cars, stole radios,
                          run a few scams. Right now I'm into
                          pick-pocketing.

                                        JULIEN
                          I see.   A master criminal.

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel.
                          You guys don't want me, I'll be more
                          than happy to leave.

               The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is
               40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a
               rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an
               intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to
               Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over.

                                        DANIEL
                               (to Sami)
                          This is Zero.

                                       SAMI
                          Hi. I'm one and this is two, three,
                          four and five.

               Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in
               Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is
               not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and
               leads him away from the others.

                                       JULIEN
                          Let me give you some advice. You don't
                          want to piss him off because he'll kill
                          you for the fun of it. What you want to
                          do is keep your mouth shut and do what
                          we tell you.

                                       ZERO
                               (in French)
                          So, we are going to America?

                                        DANIEL
                          In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.

                                       ZERO
                          Where are you from?

                                        SAMI
                          Algeria.

                                       ZERO
                          And you don't speak French?

               

                                                                         11.

               

                                       SAMI
                          Well, you know, not all Algerians speak
                          French. It's a matter of what school
                          you went too. Me I never really --

                                       ZERO
                               (overlapping)
                          -- Zero isn't interested in your life
                          story.
                               (to Daniel)
                          Who gets killed?

                                       DANIEL
                          Hopefully no one.

                                       ZERO
                               (confused)
                          No one? Then why is Zero here?

               Sami leans over to Raymond.

                                       SAMI
                          He speaks about himself in the third
                          person?

                                       RAYMOND
                          Feel free to correct him if you want.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Zero)
                          I just want you there in case there's
                          trouble.

                                       ZERO
                          And if there is, then Zero can kill
                          someone?

                                       DANIEL
                          We'll see.

               

               EXT. CAFE -- DAY

               Daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases. The door
               to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out. The scene is in FRENCH.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (to Daniel)
                          I thought I would accompany you to the
                          airport to say bon voyage... and tell
                          you that Marcel will be going with you.

                                       DANIEL
                          What?

                                       BASTALDI
                          This is a considerable move up for you,
                          Daniel. The temptation of having so
                          much money might be too much for you.

               

                                                                         12.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          You don't trust me?

                                       BASTALDI
                          I don't trust anyone. You don't get to
                          the top of this game by trusting people...
                          and after all, you are a thief. It's in
                          your nature to steal. I'm just protecting
                          my investment.

               

               INT. LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY

               For many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside
               a limo. Julien pours himself a drink. Sami plays around with the
               air conditioner.

               Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he
               comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back
               in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like
               it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que
               je taime."

                                       MARCEL
                          That's better.

               Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud
               song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the
               Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the
               radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday.
               Bastaldi has had enough.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Stop it!   Both of you!

               He turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who
               has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but
               loud enough for Zero to hear.

                                       MARCEL
                               (singing)
                          ... que je t'aime... que je...
               Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops.

               

               EXT. O'HARE AIRPORT -- MORNING

               Daniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi.

               

               EXT. CHICAGO DRIVING MONTAGE -- MORNING

               Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building.
               Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each
               successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are
               in...

               

                                                                           13.

               

               EXT. STREET -- MORNING

               An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down
               buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned
               cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.

                                       TAXI DRIVER
                          Are you sure you guys have the right
                          address? This ain't no tourist area.

               Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding.

                                        MARCEL
                          Yes.   We are sure.

               The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their
               bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS
               appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another
               two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of
               the suitcases.

                                       SAMI
                          Let me handle this.

               LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.

                                          SAMI
                          Hey, brother.     What's happening, man?

               Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar.

                                       LAMAR
                          Don't you brother me, motherfucker.

               Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air.   He casually
               lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins.

                                       LAMAR
                          What's in the bags?

                                       JULIEN
                          Dirty underwear.

               Lamar forces a laugh.

                                       LAMAR
                          Dirty underwear. That's a good one.
                          Let me explain something to you. This
                          is my street and you're gonna give me
                          want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads
                          open.

               Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Lamar, violence is never an answer to
                          settling disputes. I can see you have a
                          lot of anger... but this is not the way
                          to get it out.

               

                                                                          14.

               

                                       LAMAR
                          Get outta my face!

               Lamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an
               assortment of clubs, chains and pipes.

                                       LAMAR
                          Now, are you going to give me the
                          suitcases? Or are we going to have to
                          take them?

               Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases.

                                       ZERO
                          Va te faire foutre!

                                       LAMAR
                          What did he say?

                                       DANIEL
                          He said to go fuck yourself.

                                       ZERO
                          We are tired and bored with your bullshit.
                          So, put that stupid little knife away
                          before Zero shoves it up your ass.

                                         LAMAR
                          Who is Zero?

                                         JULIEN
                          He is.

                                       LAMAR
                               (to Julien)
                          He speaks about himself in the third
                          person?

               Julien shrugs his shoulders.

                                       LAMAR
                          Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass
                          and take my knife from me?

                                       ZERO
                          If you insist.

               Zero stands up and raises his hand.   He is holding a .9mm Glock.
               He aims it at Lamar's head.

               Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down
               the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away.
               Zero aims the gun at his groin.

                                       ZERO
                          Leave now before Zero shoots off those
                          little raisins you call balls.

               Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick
               up their bags and walk towards a building.

               

                                                                           15.

               
               Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief.

                                       SAMI
                          You put a loaded gun in your bag and
                          brought it through customs? How stupid
                          is that?

                                       ZERO
                          Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put
                          it in yours.

               Zero grins and walks away.

               

               EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               The crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks.     A peep-hole in the
               door is opened and an eye looks them over.

                                       MARCEL
                          We are looking for Sophie.    Laurant send
                          us.

               The door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's
               computer). She is late 20's, beautiful.

                                          SAMI
                               (softly)
                          Ouh La La.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               An old building, the rooms are partitioned off by sheets hanging
               from the ceiling. The main area is an artists workspace where
               large abstract paintings lean against the wall.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I wasn't expecting this many of you.
                          I've got a few sleeping bags you can
                          use.

                                          SAMI
                          Thanks.

               Of to the side, sitting on the couch is WAYNE, 20's, a burn-out
               with long hair and a scraggly goatee. His face is buried in a
               bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana. He watches a cartoon
               show on the television.

                                       SOPHIE
                               (to all of them)
                          This is Wayne. My roommate.

               Raymond walks over to him.

                                          RAYMOND
                          I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us
                          to stay here.

               

                                                                          16.

               

                                       WAYNE
                          No problem, man.
                               (offers him the bong)
                          Hey, you wanna hit?

                                          RAYMOND
                          No thank you.

               Raymond looks at the television and sees a cartoon show.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and
                          quite well known in France.

                                       WAYNE
                          Yeah, I dig him.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Although a cartoon I feel he shares a
                          universal theme: We are all searching
                          for love. No?

               Wayne stares at him with a dead pan expression as he tries to
               assemble a coherent thought.

                                        WAYNE
                          Whoa...   That's deep.

                                       SOPHIE
                          You guys hungry?

               

               INT. COFFEE SHOP -- AFTERNOON

               Because of the hour the room is not crowded. Only a few PEOPLE
               sit at the counter sipping coffee. A WAITRESS, 50's, bee hive
               hair style, face covered in make up arrives at the table.

                                       WAITRESS
                          Ready to order?

               Julien looks up at her.

                                       JULIEN
                          Could we see a wine list please?

                                          WAITRESS
                               (smirks)
                          That's cute.

                                       SOPHIE
                          They don't have a wine list.

                                       JULIEN
                          Oh, then we will have the house wine.

                                       WAITRESS
                          Sure -- and would you like that before
                          your escargot in white truffle sauce?

               

                                                                            17.

               

                                       JULIEN
                          I did not order escargot.

                                       SAMI
                          They don't serve wine here.

                                       JULIEN
                          What kind of restaurant doesn't serve
                          wine?

                                         SAMI
                          This kind.

                                         JULIEN
                          Okay.    I will have a beer.

                                       WAITRESS
                          I don't think he's grasping the concept.
                          Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or
                          root beer.

                                       JULIEN
                               (to the others)
                          C'est quoi root beer?

                                       DANIEL
                          He'll have a sprite.    We'll all have
                          sprite.

                                       WAITRESS
                          Good. Now that we've gotten the beverage
                          selection out of the way, dare we move
                          on to the main course?

                                         ZERO
                          Idiot.

               Zero grins as he puts a cigarette in his mouth.     The waitress pulls
               it out of his mouth.

                                       WAITRESS
                          And no smoking.

                                       ZERO
                               (in French)
                          No smoking? No drinking?       What kind of
                          country is this?

               

                                                                         CUT TO:

               

               CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE.
               VINNY, 40's, not the brightest bulb on the tree. His head snaps
               back as someone punches him in the face. Blood flows from his
               nose. We are in...

               

                                                                           18.

               

               EXT. ALLEY -- AFTERNOON

               Two GANGSTERS stand on each side of Vinny. They are JOEY "TWO
               TONS" 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler. NICKY
               "THE RAKE", 30's, thin a rail. They make a strange pair but they
               both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers.
               Standing in front of the them is FRANKIE ZAMMITO, 30's, a wise
               guy, tough as they come. He wears a well tailored suit, black
               leather gloves and polished shoes.

                                       VINNY
                               (frightened)
                          I'm sorry, Frankie.     Really.

               Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.

               Vinny takes a step back.

                                        ZAMMITO
                          What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd
                          I tell you when you came to me for money?
                          Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I
                          not say that?
                               (to Joey)
                          What'd I say to him?

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          You said don't do it, boss.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          That's right. I said don't do it. Did
                          you listen to me? No. You wanted the
                          money. So, I lent you twenty large.
                          Now it's been three weeks and you ain't
                          paid a dime. What do you think that
                          makes me look like on the street? I
                          don't do something to you and everyone
                          will think they can skate.

                                          VINNY
                          Frankie, I --

                                       ZAMMITO
                          -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me
                          feel bad about this. You knew what would
                          happen to you if you didn't pay. This
                          is on your head, not mine.
                               (to Joey and Nicky)
                          Break his arm.

               Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes.

                                       VINNY
                          Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!

               

                                                                          19.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          That's why we're only breaking one arm.

               

               INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

               The table is littered with plates.   Sophie has sketched out a
               diagram of a house on her napkin.

                                       SOPHIE
                          There's an exterior alarm system. There's
                          also another one in the hall that leads
                          to the bedroom with a motion detector.
                          The control panel is in the bedroom.

                                       JULIEN
                          I can handle the exterior alarm, but the
                          one in the bedroom is a problem.

                                       SAMI
                          After the outside alarm is off we go in
                          through the bedroom window.

                                       DANIEL
                               (impressed)
                          Good. Zero and Julien will go in through
                          the window and disable the motion
                          detector. The rest of us will come in
                          through the front door.

                                       JULIEN
                          What about transportation?

                                       SOPHIE
                          You can use my car.

                                       DANIEL
                          Not a good idea. Someone gets a license
                          number and it all leads back to you.
                          Raymond, you'll steal one.

                                        RAYMOND
                          No problem.

                                       SAMI
                          When do we go?

                                        SOPHIE
                          Tonight.

                                        DANIEL
                          Tonight?

                                       SOPHIE
                          I know they won't be home tonight.

                                       SAMI
                          You ever hear of jet lag?

               

                                                                         20.

               

                                           SOPHIE
                          Take a nap.

               

               EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar
               of loud MUSIC.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               As the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through
               the walls. Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch
               smoking a joint.

                                       JULIEN
                          What the hell is that?

                                         WAYNE
                          Neighbors.    They do this all the time.

                                       SAMI
                          I can't even hear myself think.

                                       ZERO
                          How are we supposed to sleep with this
                          noise?

                                       SOPHIE
                          I've asked them a hundred times to keep
                          in down. They don't listen.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I will talk to them.

               Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing.

                                           WAYNE
                          Yeah.   Right.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Not a good idea.

                                       RAYMOND
                          It's just a matter of communication.

               Raymond leaves.

               

               EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC
               grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a
               very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several
               long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE.
               Behind him are two other rough-looking men.

               

                                                                         21.

               

                                       RAYMOND
                               (cheerfully; loudly
                                over the music)
                          Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting
                          next door and I was wondering if you
                          could make your music a little less loud.

               The Biker takes a sip of his beer.

                                       BIKER
                          No.

                                       RAYMOND
                          But the music is very--

               Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer
               over Raymond's head.

                                       BIKER
                          Fuck off!

               He slams the door in Raymond's face.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

               The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond
               steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his
               head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances
               over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.

               

               EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

               Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He
               reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves.
               He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat.
               The Biker opens the door.

                                       BIKER
                          Listen asshole, I told you --

               Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of
               his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose.
               Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several
               times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.

               

               INT. BIKER'S WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a
               large glass coffee table.

               BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel
               turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers
               fists slams into the hard crown of his skull.

               BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him
               hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over.
               Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around
               and down on his knees.

               

                                                                          22.

               
               In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER
               #2 falls face forwards and is out cold.
               Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He
               is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns
               off the power. DEAD QUIET.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

               Marcel enters.   Wayne is on the couch with Raymond.

                                       WAYNE
                               (impressed)
                          What'd you say to them?

                                          MARCEL
                               (dryly)
                          Nothing.

               A plain looking building in an old neighborhood of the city.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB - ZAMMITO'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Zammito sits at his desk. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake"
               sit on the couch. Bobby Beans balding, stocky enters.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Hey, Bobby beans... How you doin'?

               He walks up to Zammito and they kiss each other on the cheek.

                                      BOBBY BEANS
                          Good. I'm doing good. How you doin',
                          Frankie?

                                        ZAMMITO
                          Good.   I'm good.

                                       BOBBY BEANS
                          Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          When you return please extend my regards
                          to Mr. Maranzano and his family.

               Zammito motions for Bobby to sit down.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Can I offer you something.    A drink?
                          Coffee?

                                          BOBBY BEANS
                          No thank you.

               

                                                            23.

               

                            ZAMMITO
               You sure? I just got a shipment of
               espresso from Sicily. Special blend.
               Can't find anything like it in the States.

                             BOBBY BEANS
               I'm good.   Really.

                            ZAMMITO
               Okay. I understand you're interested in
               one of our properties?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant
               Street. The volume on our import business
               has risen dramatically. The proceeds
               this quarter will be supernumerary due
               to the --

                            ZAMMITO
                    (overlapping)
               -- Super what?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               Supernumerary. It means better than
               expected.

                            ZAMMITO
               Then why not just fuckin' say better
               than expected? Everybody knows what
               better than expected means.

                            BOBBY BEANS
               I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance
               my communication skills.

                             ZAMMITO
               Okay.   How much?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               I'm not here to negotiate.

                            ZAMMITO
               Why are you here?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               To tell you that we're interested in the
               property.

                            ZAMMITO
               You told me that on the phone. What the
               hell are you doing here? Showing off
               your communication skills? Go back to
               your people and tell them when they're
               serious to put a number on the table.

                            BOBBY BEANS
               I will relay the particulars of our
               conversation to Mr. Maranzano.

               

                                                                         24.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah -- you do that.

               Bobby Beans leaves.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Jerk-wad!

               Zammito looks over at Joey and Nicky.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          How's my brother?

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          He's over at St. James. They had to put
                          two pins in his arm.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I said a clean break.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Hey boss, it's not a science.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Send some flowers. Something nice.
                          Roses or carnations. And one of those
                          get well soon cards.

               Nicky gets up to carry out his instructions.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to
                          his house. I don't want the kids to go
                          hungry while he's recuperating.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

               Julien and Zero are playing cards at the back of the room. Sami
               sitting by himself sorting through a BLACK CANVAS BAG filled with
               shoes. Sophie joins him. Sami pulls another pair of shoes out of
               the canvas bag.

                                       SOPHIE
                          You like shoes?

                                       SAMI
                          No, I like the bag. It would be good
                          for the job tonight.

                                       SOPHIE
                          It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left
                          it last time he was here. I'm sure he
                          wouldn't mind if you used it.

               Sami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag.

                                       SOPHIE
                          So, how did you get hooked up with these
                          guys?

               

                                                                           25.

               

                                       SAMI
                          Just lucky I guess. How'd you start
                          working for the Bastaldi's?

                                       SOPHIE
                          The art world doesn't fully appreciate
                          my talent yet. I needed some way to pay
                          the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well
                          for information.

                                       SAMI
                          So you arranged to have the people you
                          worked for robbed?

                                       SOPHIE
                          They're not nice people.

               She sees a TATTOO on Sami's arm.    It's a heart with someone's faded
               name.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I like your tattoo.

               Sami is suddenly self-conscious of it.    She traces along the letters
               with her finger.

                                       SOPHIE
                               (reading the name)
                          Casandra. Old girlfriend?

                                       SAMI
                          Something like that.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Did she break your heart?

                                       SAMI
                          Something like that.

                                          SOPHIE
                          It looks old.     Did you get it a long
                          time ago?

                                       SAMI
                          You ask a lot of questions.

                                       SOPHIE
                          That's how you get to know someone.       Did
                          it hurt when you got it?

                                       SAMI
                          I don't remember.    I was drunk.

                                       SOPHIE
                          You got it in a bar?

                                       SAMI
                          No. I got it in prison. I went in for
                          three years. When I came out she was
                          married to my best friend. Happy?

               

                                                                           26.

               

                                        SOPHIE
                          Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.

                                        SAMI
                          It's okay.   It was a long time ago.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I've been thinking about getting tattoo.
                          You know, a flower or something. On my
                          ass.

               Sami looks at her quizzically.

                                       SAMI
                          Who's gonna see it there?

                                       SOPHIE
                          The lucky ones.

               She smiles flirtatiously and walks away.

               

               EXT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING

               A car drives up. We can only see the outline of an old Chevy
               Impala. Two men get out of the car, leaving the engine running as
               they head for the liquor store.
               Across the street Raymond is checking out a Buick LaSabre, but
               stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard. He
               looks across the street and sees the Impala.

               

               INT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING

               An OLD MAN is behind the counter.   Two masked men enter with guns
               and rush up to the counter.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Gimme the money!

               The old man opens the cash register and hands him all the bills.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Open the safe!

                                       OLD MAN
                          I don't have the combination.

               Raphael pistol whips him with his gun and drags him half way over
               the counter, then presses his gun to the old man's head.

                                        OLD MAN
                          I swear!   I don't have it!

               Raphael pushes him to the floor.    He runs out of the store with
               the others.

               

                                                                         27.

               

               EXT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING

               They run out and remove their masks. RAPHAEL RUIZ, 20's, Latin,
               tough, shaved head, neck covered with tattoos. HECTOR, Latin,
               small, cubby, stops and stares at something with confusion.

                                       HECTOR
                          Hey, Vato, where's your car?

               Raphael stops as he sees the street is empty.

                                          RAPHAEL
                          My car!

               Hector has to grab Raphael who is too stunned to move and drag him
               down the street.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- EVENING

               The crew gets ready. On the table a variety of gear is laid out.
               Cells phones, electronic devices, all the tools of the trade.
               Sami throws some items into the black canvas bag. A cell phone
               rings. Julien answers it.

                                          JULIEN
                          It's Raymond.     He's outside with the
                          car.

               They grab their gear and head for the door. Sophie leans over and
               kisses Sami on the cheek. He stares at her, half surprised, half
               embarrassed.

                                          SOPHIE
                          For luck.

               

               EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               The crew steps out to find Raymond in the IMPALA. We can see it
               clearer now. It's a low rider car. Bright orange flames are
               painted on the side, wire wheels and chrome exhaust pipes.

                                       SAMI
                          I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.

                                          RAYMOND
                          Watch this.

               Raymond pushes a button and the hydraulics make the car bounce up
               and down. Sami rolls his eyes as the others get into the car.
               ACROSS THE STREET -- Lamar is standing in the shadows with one of
               his friends, watching.

               

               INT. IMPALA -- MOVING -- EVENING

               The six of them are crammed into the car as it moves down the
               street. Julien studies a map.

               

                                                                               28.

               

               INT.   RAPHAEL'S HOUSE -- EVENING

               Raphael sits on the couch. He can barely contain his anger. He
               looks up slowly, his jaw clenched. Hector sits across from him
               with a few other GANG BANGERS.

                                        HECTOR
                           Maybe you should call the police.

                                        RAPHAEL
                           Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and
                           a stolen radio in the car.

                                        HECTOR
                           I just thought that--

                                        RAPHAEL
                                (overlapping)
                           -- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good
                           at it.

               The other Gang Bangers laugh at Hector.

                                        RAPHAEL
                           Go do something -- get some beers for
                           the guys.

               Hector slinks out of the room.        Raphael's face hardens.

                                        RAPHAEL
                           When I find out who did this I'm going
                           to mount their head on my dashboard!

               

               INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- EVENING

               A family operation. Checkerboard table clothes. Candles burning
               in Chianti bottles. On the stereo VIC DAMONE sings "Angela Mia".
               Zammito waits at a table. His cell phone rings.

                                           ZAMMITO
                                   (into phone)
                           Yeah?

                                        HALF TOOTH TONY (V.O.)
                           Mr. B. wants to see you.

                                       ZAMMITO
                           Now? I've got a date with a drop dead
                           major babe.

                                        HALF TOOTH TONY (V.O.)
                           I'll tell him that.

               Zammito thinks it over.

                                          ZAMMITO
                           Okay.    I'm coming.

               He walks over to the MARIO, the OWNER of the restaurant.

               

                                                                         29.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives
                          tell her I had an emergency.

                                       MARIO
                          Of course, Mr. Zammito.

               

               EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD STADIUM -- NIGHT

               The Impala is stopped in the parking lot.

                                       RAYMOND (V.O.)
                          I think we went the wrong way.

                                       SAMI (V.O.)
                          Oh, you think?

                                       MARCEL (V.O.)
                          The map said to go left.

                                       JULIEN (V.O.)
                          Yeah and if you turned it around it would
                          say to go right.

                                          MARCEL (V.O.)
                               (amused)
                          Oh yeah.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE, STUDY -- EVENING

               Zammito enters to find ANGELO BONANNO, 60's, powerful, head of the
               Chicago Mob. He is smoking a cigar with a glass of brandy.

                                       BONANNO
                          Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You
                          want something?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          No, I'm good, Angelo.

               Bonanno motions to the couch.    Zammito sits down.

                                       BONANNO
                          I understand Bobby Beans came to see you
                          today.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk
                          about buying the Merchant Street
                          warehouse.

                                          BONANNO
                          And?

                                          ZAMMITO
                          And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.

               

                                                                         30.

               

                                       BONANNO
                          He's trying to get a foot hold in our
                          territory.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          He sticks his toes in the water again,
                          we'll cut 'em off.

                                       BONANNO
                          Business must be good if he can afford
                          to buy up useless property.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I heard this quarter his profits are
                          gonna be supernumerary.

               Bonanno stares at him.

                                       BONANNO
                          They're gonna be what?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Supernumerary. It means better than
                          expected.

                                         BONANNO
                          Good word.

               Half Tooth Tony, 30's, built like a tank step into the room. He
               has the face of a boxer, several of his teeth are chipped or broken.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          Mr. Bonanno, I just wanted to remind you
                          that you have an appointment in ten
                          minutes.

               Half Tooth Tony leaves.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Someone else coming?

                                       BONANNO
                          Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling
                          me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes.
                          You ever watch it?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Uh, no --

                                       BONANNO
                          You should. You can learn a lot about
                          the criminal justice system on a program
                          like that. Very informative. Stay and
                          watch it with me.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just
                          gonna go home if it's all the same to
                          you.

               

                                                                         31.

               
               Bonanno affectionately slaps Zammito's cheeks.

                                        BONANNO
                          Go.   Rest.

               Bonanno takes a sip of his brandy, but his eyes stay on Zammito.

                                        BONANNO
                          Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about
                          your brother?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          He missed three weeks.

                                       BONANNO
                          Your own brother? You couldn't send
                          someone else to do it?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
                          Rake" did the deed.

                                       BONANNO
                          But you were there?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Angelo, we live and die by the rules we
                          make. We are men of honor, but honor
                          without respect is a... horse-less
                          carriage.

               A long beat. Bonanno thinks about what he said, not sure what to
               make of it, then...

                                       BONANNO
                          What the fuck does that mean?

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The Impala is by the pumps. Sami leans out the window holding the
               map as he speaks with the station attendant.

               

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- NIGHT

               An upscale neighborhood. Expensive homes line the wooded street.
               The Impala stops and the crew gets out.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Raymond)
                          Park on the next street over.   We'll
                          meet you when we're done.

               

               EXT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Julien attaches a device to the alarm panel. A series of numbers
               flash by as the computer cracks the code. One by one, the numbers
               stop until the entry code is displayed on the screen. He enters
               the numbers on the alarm and nods to the others.

               

                                                                           32.

               
               Julien and Zero move around to the side of the house as Daniel,
               Sami and Marcel wait in the shadows.

               

               EXT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE, SIDE OF HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Julien places a retractable ladder against the wall and climbs up.
               He pries open the window and climbs in. Zero follows.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Dark. Julien makes his way to the door and repeats the process
               with another alarm panel. Zero sits on the corner of the bed and
               waits patiently. Julien turns off the hall alarm and nods to Zero.
               Zero speed dials a number on his cell phone.

                                       ZERO
                          We're in.

               

               EXT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Daniel uses a locksmith tool and quickly pries the lock out of the
               door. They go inside.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Julien and Zero wait for them. We hear a toilet flush. The door
               to the bathroom opens and a man steps out. In an instant Julien
               and Zero jump him. The others enter and quickly join in to subdue
               the man.

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               Raymond waits in the Impala.    He can't resist using the hydraulics,
               raising the car up and down.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               The lights are on. The room is an interior designers nightmare.
               Clashing colors, zebra skin bedspread. We move along Daniel, Sami,
               Marcel, Julien and Zero as they stare at something.
               THEIR POV -- Tied to a chair, his mouth taped shut, is a very angry
               Frankie Zammito. He yells, his voice muffled by the tape, but
               it's not hard to understand what he's saying.

                                       DANIEL
                          So much for no one being home.

               Julien goes to a bookcase and finds the safe.

                                       JULIEN
                          At least they got this right.

               He removes his tools and goes to work. Sami stares at Zammito
               with vague recognition, then turns to the others.

               

                                                                            33.

               

                                       SAMI
                          We've got to be careful not to use our
                          real names while we're in here.

                                          DANIEL
                          Good idea.

                                       SAMI
                          I'll be Elvis and you--

                                       MARCEL
                               (overlapping)
                          -- I want to be Elvis.

                                          SAMI
                          It's my idea.

                                       MARCEL
                               (whining)
                          C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you
                          do.

                                        SAMI
                          Okay.   You can be Elvis.

               Marcel smiles happily.

                                       SAMI
                          And the rest of us are...    John, Paul,
                          George and Ringo.

               Marcel sees an autographed baseball on the book shelf.

                                       MARCEL
                          Hey, Barry Bonds. The home run king.

               Marcel tosses the ball into the black canvas bag.     Daniel stares
               at him.

                                       MARCEL
                          It's for my nephew.

               

               INT. HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET -- NIGHT

               A surveillance operation. Two FBI agents sit near the window.       A
               small card table is littered with coffee cups. SPECIAL AGENT
               AGENT HADLEY, 40's, a hardened field agent, picks up a pair of
               binoculars and looks out the window.

               HIS POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS:    of Zammito tied to the chair
               and surrounded by the others.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Looks like Zammito's being robbed.

                                       FBI AGENT
                          Should I call C.P.D.?

               

                                                                         34.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Yeah, but tell them not to move until
                          these morons come out of the house.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               BLACK SCREEN. From inside the safe we see Julien open the door.
               Daniel and Julien look inside. There are a several stacks of cash,
               envelopes and a small cardboard box. Julien starts removing
               everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag.

                                       JULIEN
                          Where are the jewels?   There aren't any
                          jewels.

               Marcel looks as surprised as they are.

                                       MARCEL
                          There has to be.

                                       JULIEN
                          I'm telling you I've pulled out everything
                          in the safe. There aren't any jewels.

                                       MARCEL
                          There must be half a million dollars
                          here though.

                                       DANIEL
                          Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember?
               Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face. He moves over to
               the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with
               various famous people. Next to the photographs is a plaque that
               reads: TO FRANCIS ZAMMITO...

               We can see the color drain from Sami's face. He glances over at
               Zammito whose eyes are locked on his. Sami grabs Daniel and Marcel
               and pulls them aside.

                                        SAMI
                               (babbling nervously)
                          We have a problem. Problem isn't the
                          right word. Dilemma. No that really
                          doesn't describe --
                               (flatly)
                          Do you know who that is?

                                        MARCEL
                          Mr. Taylor?

                                       SAMI
                          No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

                                       DANIEL
                               (sensing something
                                bad is coming)
                          It's not?

               

                                                                             35.

               

                                       SAMI
                          That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss
                          of the Chicago Mafia.

                                       MARCEL
                               (confused)
                          Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

                                       SAMI
                               (screaming)

                          WE'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE, YOU FUCKIN'

                          IDIOT!

               A beat. The three of them turn and look at Zammito. The
               seriousness of the situation finally dawns on Marcel. He moves
               over to Zammito and rips the tape off his mouth.

                                       MARCEL
                          Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a
                          big mistake here. May I use your phone?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Feel free.

               Marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials.

               

                                                                  QUICK CUT TO:

               

               INT. BASTALDI'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Bastaldi removes a sleep mask and answers the phone.

                                         BASTALDI
                          Hello?

                                         BASTALDI
                          Who?

                                         BASTALDI
                          Marcel?

               

                                                                     CUT BACK TO:

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Marcel continues his conversation.

                                       MARCEL (Cont'd)
                          We went to the address we were given and
                          had to tie up the owner of the house who
                          turns out to be some Mafia guy.

                                       BASTALDI (V.O.)
                               (in French)

                               (in French)
                          You're calling me on your cell phone,
                          right?

                                         MARCEL
                          No.

               We can hear Bastaldi sigh over the line.

                          Oui.

                                       BASTALDI (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Take what you've got and get out of there.

               Bastaldi hangs up.   The line goes dead.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Walk out of here with nothing and I'll
                          forget this ever happened.

                                         SAMI
                          Yeah. Right.     You're not a vendetta
                          kind of guy.

               

                                                                            37.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I'll find you. No matter where you go
                          I'll find you.

                                       DANIEL
                          You don't carry the same weight in France
                          as you do here.

               Marcel whispers into Daniel's ear.

                                       MARCEL
                          You think it's smart to tell him we're
                          French?

                                       DANIEL
                          I think he's already figured that out.

               Zero who has been standing quietly by the window sees something
               across the street. A flash. Light reflecting off glass. He takes
               a pair of night vision binoculars out of one of the bags and looks
               out the window.
               ZERO'S POV -- of Agent Hadley and the other FBI Agent watching
               him.

                                       ZERO
                          We are being watched.
               Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.

                                          DANIEL
                          Cops?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          FBI. They've been there for months.
                          Think I don't know. Morons.

               Daniel closes the curtains. He tries to think. The crew huddles
               together in the corner, speaking softly so Zammito can't hear them.

                                       JULIEN
                          What do we do?

                                       MARCEL
                          I was told to take what we have and go.

                                        JULIEN
                          Go where?   The police are outside.

               Daniel looks at the others.

                                       DANIEL
                          If we do this we all have to agree.

               Marcel and Zero nod.   Daniel looks to Julien who appears indecisive.

                                          JULIEN
                          I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --

               

                                                                          38.

               

                                       SAMI
                          C'mon, get real, will you. You think
                          he's just going to forget about this?
                          These guys are all about respect. All
                          about honor. He's coming after us, so
                          we might as well take the money.

               Julien nods.   Sami walks over and grabs the black canvas bag.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You're all dead.

               Zero grins then tapes his mouth closed again.

               

               EXT. BACK OF HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The crew goes out the back door and climb over a fence.

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The crew arrives to find Raymond still playing with the hydraulics
               of the Impala. They get in.

               

               EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               The Impala pulls into a driveway and goes to the rear of the
               building, out of view from the street.

               

               EXT. SOPHIE'S FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT

               The crew waits as the door is unlocked.   Wayne opens the door in a
               stoned haze.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               The crew places their equipment on the table.

                                       SOPHIE (V.O.)
                          Wayne, who is it?

               She enters and appears surprised to see them.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I wasn't expecting you guys back so fast.
                          How'd it go?

               She quickly notices their angry expressions.

                                       SAMI
                          How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how
                          would you say it went?

                                       DANIEL
                          I would have to say... pretty fuckin'
                          bad. You gave us the wrong address
                          Sophie.

               

                                                                         39.

               

                                          SOPHIE
                          No, I didn't.

                                       JULIEN
                          Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?

                                          SOPHIE
                          Yes.

                                       JULIEN
                          And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.

                                         SOPHIE
                          No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.

                                          DANIEL
                          That moron.

                                       MARCEL
                          It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway...
                          Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.

                                       DANIEL
                          Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving
                          in the morning.

               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Agent Hadley checks his watch.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          What the hell are they doing in there?

                                       FBI AGENT
                          Chicago P.D. says they can't hold the
                          units here any longer. They want to
                          know if they should go in?

               Agent Hadley thinks a moment.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          Tell them no.     We'll advise if anything
                          changes.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Zammito is still tied to his chair.
               HIS POV -- of the cordless phone of his bed.
               He pushes with his feet, sliding the chair over to the bed, then
               starts rocking back and forth until he tips over forward, his face
               pressed against the mattress. Using his nose he turns on the phone
               and presses a speed dial number.

               

                                                                          40.

               

               INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Joey "Two Tons" is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt. Next to him
               is his wife, her hair in curlers, her eyes covered by a black sleep
               mask. The phone rings. Joey answers it.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Yeah?

               We hear Zammito's muffled cries for help. It almost sounds like
               someone moaning during a sexual act. Joey is surprised at first,
               then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep. He slides
               his hand under the covers and closes his eyes.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                               (quietly)
                          Hmmm.... Oh yeah... Uh huh

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Zammito stops as he begins to realize what Joey is doing on the
               other end of the line. He grimaces, then shouts louder.

               

               INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under
               the covers. We hear a loud scream on the phone.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          That's right baby, give it to papa Joey.

               He is really deep into his fantasy world when...

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS" WIFE
                          Joey, who is that?

               Joey sits up quickly.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                               (loudly; for his wife's
                                sake)
                          -- And don't call here again, you pervert.

               He slams the phone down. A long beat. It rings again. This time
               he checks his caller ID and sees that call is coming from Zammito's
               house.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Yeah boss?

               Again we hear the same muffled cries.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Boss?

               

               INT. BODY SHOP -- NIGHT

               Raphael enters with Hector and two GANG-BANGERS.   The room is filled
               with low rider cars.

               

                                                                            41.

               
               Working under the hood of a car is FELIX, 30's, sleazy. Raphael
               walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and
               squishing his face between the hood and engine.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Someone stole my car tonight!

                                       FELIX
                          C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I
                          would steal your car?

                                       RAPHAEL
                          You run a chop shop for low riders.
                          Yes, I think you'd steal my car.

               Raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again.

                                       FELIX
                          I swear I didn't. I wouldn't!

                                       RAPHAEL
                          And I should just believe--

                                       HECTOR
                               (overlapping; to Felix)
                          -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.

                                       RAPHAEL
                               (to Hector)
                          Hector, don't interrupt me.

                                       HECTOR
                          He told Enrique he didn't know anything
                          about his car.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          I don't give a shit about your cousin's
                          car. We're here about my car. So, shut
                          your mouth! You think you can do that?
                          You think you can keep your big mouth
                          shut?

               Hector is embarrassed as Raphael once again berates him in front
               of the others. Raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench.
               He clamps them down on the tip of Felix's nose and squeezes.
               Felix's face fills with pain.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          If I find out you're lying. If I find
                          out you know anything about this I'm
                          going to come back and cut off your nose.

               He gives the pliers one last squeeze, then releases Felix.

                                       RAPHAEL
                               (to the others)
                          Vamos.

               

                                                                            42.

               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Agent Hadley sips a cup of warm coffee.     He looks very concerned.

                                       FBI AGENT
                          Sir, do you think we could have a hostage
                          situation in there?

               Agent Hadley is about to answer when he sees something.
               HIS POV -- of a Lincoln Town Car pull up.    Joey "Two Tons" gets
               out, goes to the front door and enters.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Hold on a second. Joey "Two Tons" just
                          pulled up.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Joey enters to find Zammito tied to the chair, face down on the
               bed.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Jesus, Boss!

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Zammito stands behind the bar pouring himself a large scotch.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          They were all French guys.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          French guys?    You mean like from France?

                                       ZAMMITO
                               (with strained patience)
                          Yeah, French guys from France.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What'd they take?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Everything.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Everything?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Everything.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Boy, you must be pissed.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Well, you know, when five guys break
                          into my house in the middle of the night,
                          stick guns in my face, tie me up and
                          steal from me... it does irritate me.

               

                                                                         43.

               

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Well, I must say you're handling it very
                          well.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You know why I'm handling it very well?
                          Because you're going to get these guys
                          for me.

                                        JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Okay boss.   Where are they?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          If I knew where they were you wouldn't
                          have to find them, would you?

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          You didn't say find them. You said,
                          "get them."

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Just find them!

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Okay boss.

               Zammito stares at Joey for a long beat, then...

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Papa Joey?

               Joey looks away, embarrassed.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               Sami can't sleep. He walks over to the table and sorts through
               the canvas bag containing the contents of Zammito's safe. Inside
               a small cardboard box he finds several cassette tapes. He removes
               the box and walks to the stereo system on the floor, then inserts
               a tape into the cassette deck. A moment later Sophie enters.

                                         SOPHIE
                          Can't sleep?

                                         SAMI
                          No.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I'm sorry things went so wrong today.

                                       SAMI
                          It's not your fault.

               She notices the box of tapes.

                                       SOPHIE
                          What are you doing?

               

                                                                              44.

               

                                         SAMI
                            I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes.
                            See what's so important that a mob guy
                            has to lock it away in his safe.

                                         SOPHIE
                            Sounds boring.

                                         SAMI
                            It's three in the morning.    Not much
                            else to do.

               She grins seductively, then leans in towards him.

                                         SOPHIE
                            I can think of something.
               They kiss.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               Sami is asleep on the floor, curled up under several blankets. He
               wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find Sophie. She is
               not there. Sami looks around for her.
               Wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint.

                                         WAYNE
                            She's not here, man.

                                            SAMI
                            Where is she?

                                         WAYNE
                            I think she went to do some laundry.
                            Threw some stuff in a bag and left.

               It takes a moment for Sami to connect the thoughts.

                                            SAMI
                            Bag?
               Sami runs to the table.      The black canvas bag is gone.
               CLOSE ON DANIEL:    Asleep.    Sami shakes him.   He opens his eyes.

                                          SAMI
                            Get up.   We've been ripped off!

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Daniel and Sami are with the crew. They are not a happy bunch.
               Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television.

                                         JULIEN
                            Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't
                            trust anyone these days.

               

                                                                          45.

               

                                       RAYMOND
                          She took everything!    Didn't even leave
                          us cab fare.

               A thought occurs to Sami.

                                       SAMI
                          Not everything.

               He removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before
               Sophie entered.

                                       SAMI
                          I was going to listen to it last night
                          but I --

               He realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened.

                                       SAMI
                          -- feel asleep.

               Wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh.

                                       WAYNE
                          No you didn't, dude. You were bangin'
                          Sophie. I saw you guys going at it.

                                       DANIEL
                          You slept with her?

                                       SAMI
                          Well, actually I would say she slept
                          with me.

               Daniel stares at him angrily.

                                       SAMI
                          What's the big deal? It's not like I
                          was on guard duty or something.

                                       DANIEL
                          You didn't think it was little suspicious
                          that someone you only knew for a few
                          hours wanted to sleep with you?

                                        SAMI
                          No.   Chicks dig me.

               Daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player.   On the tape
               we hear a phone ringing.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                          Hello?

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          It's me. I need an answer from you if
                          I'm going to move.

               

                                                                         46.

               

                                       MAN'S VOICE
                          We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of
                          work' here. We're talking about a boss.

               Sami is the first to realize what he is hearing.

                                         SAMI
                          Holy shit.

                                         RAYMOND
                          What?

               Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the
               rest.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's
                          fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The
                          old ways are gone. If we don't change
                          now we're going to get pushed out. I
                          need to know if I can count on your
                          support?

               A pause on the line.

                                         MAN'S VOICE
                          Yeah.

               The line goes dead.    Sami leans back.

                                       SAMI
                          No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk
                          out with this stuff. He's planning on
                          killing Bonanno and taking over the
                          family.

                                       JULIEN
                          This wasn't the deal! The deal was to
                          steal a necklace, not get in the middle
                          of a Mafia war.

                                       MARCEL
                          The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says
                          it is.

                                       DANIEL
                          You know, if you could get your nose out
                          of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you
                          might see what's going on around you.

                                       JULIEN
                          I knew this was a mistake! I knew it
                          last night when you asked me to go along
                          with this. I could hear that little
                          voice in my head saying, "don't do it!
                          Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I
                          ever listen to myself?

               

                                                                         47.

               

                                       SAMI
                          Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal
                          with that.

                                       MARCEL
                          What are you guys so scared of? Zammito
                          doesn't know who we are. We just get
                          out of town and it's over.

                          Oh, you think it's that easy?

                                        RAYMOND
                          Yeah.   We just go home.

                                        DANIEL
                          We can't.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the
                          airport and get on a plane.

                                       SAMI
                          They'll be waiting for us at the airport.

                                       DANIEL
                          You steal some money from a man he gets
                          over it in time. But these tapes. He's
                          never going to stop looking for us.

                                       SAMI
                          We have to find Sophie.

                                       RAYMOND
                          How are we going to do that?

                                       WAYNE
                          I know where she went.

               They all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint.

                                       WAYNE
                          I heard her talking on the phone. Bay
                          View Motel. It's about five blocks from
                          here.

               

               EXT. STREET -- MORNING

               A beat up Ford Pinto sputters down the street, black smoke spewing
               from the tail pipe.

               

               INT. PINTO -- MOVING -- MORNING

               Raphael is at the wheel, his eyes scanning the street for his car.
               In the passenger seat Hector sits calmly. They come to a red light
               and stop.
               RAPHAEL'S POV -- Across the street is low rider car.

               

                                                                             48.

               
               Raphael stares at it as he thinks about his own car.
               ON HECTOR. We see the Impala pull up beside them.       Raymond is
               driving. Daniel, Sami and Zero are with him.
               Hector glances over and sees the Impala. Raymond smiles at him
               and nods. Hector slowly nods back. He looks over at Raphael who
               is still looking out the window.
               The light turns green. The Impala turns right.     Raphael looks
               over at a confused Hector.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Tell me the truth Hector... do you think
                          we'll find my car?

                                         HECTOR
                          Hard to say.

               

               EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

               A motel like any other.   Sami stands outside the office with Daniel,
               Raymond and Zero.

                                       RAYMOND
                          How do we know what room she's in?

                                         SAMI
                          Wait here.

               

               INT. OFFICE -- BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

               Sami enters.   Behind the counter is the MOTEL CLERK, middle-aged,
               balding.

                                       SAMI
                          Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's
                          about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          I can't give out information on our
                          guests.

                                       SAMI
                          C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          So are half the people in this place.    I
                          can't help you, pal.

               Sami nods and walks outside. Through the window we see him talking
               with the others. A beat. Sami steps back inside with Zero.

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          Look, I can't tell you --
               Before he can finish the sentence Zero has his gun out and wedged
               under the clerks jaw.

               

                                                                         49.

               

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          Room fourteen.

                                          ZERO
                          Thank you.

               

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Sami knocks. The others stand off to the side of the door. Sophie
               opens the door and sees Sami. Before she can slam it he pushes it
               open.

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Sami pushes her onto the bed.

                                       SAMI
                          I really thought we had something special
                          going. I can't tell you what a
                          disappointment you've turned out to be.

                                       SOPHIE
                          After last night I could say the same
                          for you.

               Sami feigns a smile. Zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is
               alone. He looks at Daniel and shake his head. Raymond finds the
               black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents.

                                       RAYMOND
                          The money isn't here.

                                       SAMI
                          Where is it, Sophie?

                                          SOPHIE
                          I don't know.

                                       DANIEL
                          If you think because you're a women this
                          can't go hard on you, think again.

               She stares at them defiantly.

                                       SAMI
                          Who are you waiting for?

                                       SOPHIE
                          Stick around and find out.

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- MORNING

               A knock on the door. Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth
               just in case she gets any stupid ideas. Daniel opens the door.
               Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of
               Zero's gun pressed against his head.

               

                                                                            50.

               
               Hadley steps into the room. Daniel closes the door. Zero searches
               him. Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet. He
               opens it and sees his FBI identification.

                                          ZERO
                          He's FBI.

               Zero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is
               strapped to his ankle. He gives the gun to Sami.

                                       RAYMOND
                          What is she doing with an agent du FBI?

               Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag.    Slowly
               it starts to come together in his mind.

                                       SAMI
                          We've been set up.

               He stares at Sophie angrily.

                                       SAMI
                          We didn't go to the wrong house. We
                          went to right one, didn't we Sophie?

               Her expression gives away nothing.

                                       SAMI
                          They send us to Zammito's house. The
                          FBI is right across the street watching
                          the whole thing, but they don't move. A
                          crime is going down and they don't move.
                          Why?
                               (beat)
                          Because they were waiting for us to come
                          out so they could arrest us.

                                       ZERO
                          What does arresting us get them?

                                       SAMI
                               (to Hadley)
                          You wanna tell him?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're telling it fine.

               Daniel motions to Zero.

                                       DANIEL
                          You see my friend over there? I nod to
                          him and he's going to put a bullet in
                          your knee.

               Zero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go
               ahead.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          You wouldn't.

               

                                                                         51.

               
               Daniel nods.   Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          That's going to make a lot of noise.
                          Not much time for a conversation after
                          you pull the trigger.

               They know he's right.

                                       SAMI
                          He's got a point.

               Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls
               the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires
               together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches
               them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams.
               Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark
               on his hand.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Okay! Okay! We've been investigating
                          Zammito for years, but we've never had
                          enough evidence for a warrant to search
                          his house. We got word through a snitch
                          that Zammito was planning on taking
                          Bonanno out.

                                       DANIEL
                          We know all this.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You just don't take out a boss. You
                          need permission from the other families
                          to do something like that. Our informant
                          told us that Zammito was talking with
                          other bosses and recording their
                          conversations in case they later claimed
                          they weren't involved. Look at these
                          tapes. The guy has recorded every
                          conversation he's had for years.

                                       DANIEL
                          So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when
                          we come out and the contents of the safe
                          is now evidence which you can use against
                          him.

               Agent Hadley nods.

                                       SAMI
                               (to Sophie)
                          What are you getting out of this?

               There is no point in hiding anything now.

                                      SOPHIE
                          Money. It was supposed to simple.    In
                          and out.

                                       SOPHIE (Cont'd)
                          Zammito wasn't supposed to be there.

               

                                                                   QUICK CUT TO:

               

               INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- LAST NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

               We see Zammito walk over to Mario.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives
                          will you explain to her I had an
                          emergency.

                                       MARIO
                          Of course, Mr. Zammito.

               Zammito leaves. Through the window we see Joey "Two Tons" open
               the door to the car. Zammito and Joey get in and drive away. A
               beat. A Taxi pulls up. The front door opens and Sophie enters,
               all dressed up and beautiful. She walks up to Mario.

                                         SOPHIE
                          Hi.    I'm meeting Frankie Zammito --

               

                                                                    CUT BACK TO:

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Sami stares at her with contempt.

                                         SAMI
                          Why?

                                       SOPHIE
                          Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

                                         DANIEL
                          For what?

                                        SOPHIE
                          Laurant and Vincent were in business
                          with Zammito.

                                       DANIEL
                          What kind of business?

                                       SOPHIE
                          Black market art. Zammito got to a few
                          key security guards at the Metropolitan
                          Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the
                          artists to make copies of famous works.
                          They'd switch the paintings, send the
                          originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's
                          would sell them to private collectors.

               

                                                                      53.

               

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                          We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet.
                          We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's
                          "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week
                          with a copy. It was on loan from the
                          London National Gallery and they're not
                          going to be very happy when they find
                          out about it.

                                       SAMI
                          So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds
                          to trade up for his brother?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito.
                          If we got what we wanted we'd let his
                          brother go providing he tells us where
                          the Van Gogh and the other paintings
                          are.

                                       RAYMOND
                          No one has mentioned the part of the
                          plan about us getting caught and going
                          to prison.

                                       DANIEL
                          We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                          You walk out with that bag and you won't
                          only have Zammito and his people after
                          you. You'll have the entire United States
                          justice department. How far do you think
                          you'll get? I know who you are Mr. Foray?
                          Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet.
                                (looks at Zero)
                          Mr...

               Agent Hadley looks to Sophie.

                                        SOPHIE
                          Zero.   That's all I know.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You'll never get out of the city.

               They move to the door.

               

               EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

               Daniel, Sami, Raymond and Zero walk to the Impala.

                                       DANIEL
                          Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!

                                       ZERO
                          You want Zero to kill him?

               

                                                                         54.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          I'm going to kill him myself!

                                       ZERO
                          What about the money?

                                       SAMI
                          It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't
                          have time to go anywhere else before she
                          came here.

                                       ZERO
                          We don't know that for sure.

                                       DANIEL
                          Forget the money! We've got bigger
                          problems than the money right now.

                                       RAYMOND
                          She probably hid it at her place.    The
                          six of us could find it in --

                                       SAMI
                               (overlapping)
                          -- We don't have time to look for it.
                          Hadley's first move is going to be to
                          look for us there.

               Daniel dials a number on his cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                          We're moving. Pack up and be on the
                          street in five minutes.

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Agent Hadley steps out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around the
               burn on his hand.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          This is turning to shit. If word gets
                          out of my involvement in this I'll go to
                          prison.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Listen, we know their names. They don't
                          know the city. You'll find them. You're
                          the FBI.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If
                          I do the tapes become evidence.

                                       SOPHIE
                          They're supposed to be evidence.    That's
                          why Bastaldi set this up.

               

                                                                           55.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These
                          tapes are gold. Do you have any idea
                          what Zammito would pay to get them back?

                                       SOPHIE
                          I thought you wanted Zammito?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          What for? The minute I get him some
                          other Gavone will take his place. I've
                          been doing this for twenty years. When
                          I retire it's not going to be to some
                          trailer park in the suburbs.

               She likes the idea.   Already she's thinking how she can work her
               way into this.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Too many people know about my involvement
                          in this.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Then we just have to make sure everyone
                          who knows can't say anything.

               His jaw tightens.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're right about that.

               Hadley is standing behind her. He lifts up the brass lamp with
               his towel and swings down hard towards Sophie's head.

               

               EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               Marcel, Julien and Wayne are waiting as the Impala drives up.
               Raymond hops out of the car.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I would like to thank you for your
                          hospitality.
                               (hands him a card)
                          If you are ever in Paris here is my
                          number.

                                        WAYNE
                          Cool.

               Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car.    Daniel sees
               Lamar standing across the street.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to the others)
                          I'll be right back.
               He gets out of the car and walks over to him.

               

                                                                       56.

               

                                       LAMAR
                          What do you want now?

                                        DANIEL
                          Guns.   Can you get them?

                                       LAMAR
                          Man, I can get anything.

                                       DANIEL
                          Don't bullshit me.

                                       LAMAR
                          I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns.
                          I can get any kind of gun you want. But
                          they ain't gonna help your sorry ass.
                          You ain't been in town one day and already
                          you got two of the toughest people in
                          Chicago looking for you. How is that
                          possible?

                                       DANIEL
                          I've got a way with people.

                                       LAMAR
                          I can see that. The man's car you stole.
                          Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th
                          Street gang and one crazy motherfucker.
                          And Frankie Zammito's got the word out
                          he's looking for some French dudes.
                          You're French ain't ya?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'm from Belgium.

                                       LAMAR
                          Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was
                          you. You know Zammito just put his own
                          brother in the hospital? Broke his arm
                          cause he was late on a debt. I mention
                          this to illustrate the kind of people
                          who are lookin' for you.

                                       DANIEL
                          Why haven't you turned us in?

                                       LAMAR
                          I ain't no rat.
                               (beat)
                          You got money, right?

               Daniel nods.

                                       LAMAR
                          And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you
                          a commission... kind of like a brokerage
                          fee.

               

                                                                           57.

               

                                          DANIEL
                          How much?

                                       LAMAR
                          A thousand dollars?

                                          DANIEL
                          Fine.

               Daniel hands him his cell phone.

                          Take this. I'll call you in a few hours.
                          You tell me where we meet.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               Wayne is on the couch watching TV. There is a loud knock on the
               door. He opens the door to find Agent Hadley.

                                          WAYNE
                          Yeah?

               Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters.

                                       WAYNE
                          Hey dude, what do you think you're doing?

               Hadley flashes his badge.

                                       WAYNE
                          Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a
                          warrant or something?

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                          Not today.   Where are your friends?

                                       WAYNE
                          They left about a half hour ago.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Where did they go?

                                          WAYNE
                          I dunno.

               Hadley punches Wayne in the face.    Wayne falls to the floor.

                                       WAYNE
                          Hey man, you can't do that!

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          What?   This?

               Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          Or this?

               Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the ribs.

               

                                                                          58.

               

                                         WAYNE
                           Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                           I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now,
                           if you don't want me to keep on hurting
                           you, it's important that I believe you
                           and right now I don't. So tell me, where
                           did they go?

                                        WAYNE
                           I swear man, I don't know. They packed
                           up and left a half hour ago.
                                (points to coffee
                                 table)
                           All I got is one of their phone numbers
                           in Paris.

               Hadley sees the phone number Raymond gave Wayne on the coffee table.
               He puts it in his pocket and stares at Wayne, then just for the
               hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs.

               

               EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- DAY

               A MAID stops her cart in front of room fourteen.   She KNOCKS.

                                           MAID
                           Maid service.

               No answer. She uses her key and steps into the room.   A beat.   We
               hear a loud scream.

               

               EXT.   HOLIDAY HOTEL -- EVENING

               A large building near the freeway.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               Raymond is on the phone.

                                        RAYMOND
                                (in French)
                           I know Mama, but I couldn't call you
                           yesterday we were very busy.
                                (listens)
                           No, nothing's more important than you.
                                (listens)
                           I don't know. I think I'm going to have
                           to stay a few more days.

               Daniel, Sami and Julien sit at a table. Marcel stares out the
               window sadly. Zero is flipping through the television channels.

                                        DANIEL
                                (to Marcel)
                           Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with
                           Zammito?

               

                                                                      59.

               

                                         MARCEL
                          No.

                                         DANIEL
                          You're sure?

                                       MARCEL
                          I think if he told me he was going to
                          steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase"
                          I would remember it.

                                       SAMI
                               (correcting him)
                          "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."

                                       MARCEL
                          Whatever! He never told me about the
                          Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

               Raymond hangs up the phone and joins the others.

                                       SAMI
                          It makes sense. I mean, do you really
                          think he would come along if he knew we
                          were being set up?

                                       DANIEL
                          I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi
                          told him to.

                                       MARCEL
                          Fuck you! You know I'd never go along
                          with something like this.

                                         DANIEL
                          Do I?

                                       MARCEL
                          This ain't about that and you know it.
                          This is about you never forgiving me for
                          leaving the crew.

                                       SAMI
                               (surprised)
                          You guys used to work together?

                                       MARCEL
                          Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried
                          to do something to better myself.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?

                                       MARCEL
                               (in French)
                          Better than spending my life crawling
                          through windows in the middle of the
                          night.

               

                                                                           60.

               

                                       SAMI
                          All right, knock it off.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          All you are is a professional ass-kisser.

                                        MARCEL
                                (in French)
                          I'm not a guy who is known for his
                          patience and right now you're testing
                          mine.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          What is that a threat? Are you fuckin'
                          threatening me, Marcel?

               They take a step towards each other.   Sami steps in between them.

                                       SAMI
                          I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm
                          concerned you two girls can bitch slap
                          yourselves silly when this is over, but
                          right now we've got to figure out what's
                          going on.

                                       RAYMOND
                          It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up.
                          He's closing down his operation and this
                          is his way of saying thanks to all of
                          us.

                                       JULIEN
                          Well, I say the whole deal is off. In
                          fact, if you ask me, there never was a
                          deal because we were screwed from the
                          start.

               Zero turns to another channel. A news broadcast.     We see a mug
               shot photo of SAMI on the screen.

                                       ZERO
                          Hey Sami, you're on TV.

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, it's not your picture on the TV,
                          it's mine. So, try to be cool.

                                       JULIEN
                          Don't tell me to be cool! We were
                          supposed to be in and out. In and out!
                          In the last twenty four hours we've
                          managed to get the Mafia... the FBI...
                          the Chicago Police Department and a group
                          of Latin gang members after us. I haven't
                          left out anyone, have I?
                               (pretends to think
                                about it)
                          I don't think so, because we've already
                          pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!

                                       SAMI
                          We've got to get out of here.

                                       JULIEN
                          That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?

               Sami gets into Julien's face.

                                       SAMI
                          You're not helping.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Julien, what you're doing right now is a
                          very normal psychological reaction to
                          stress. You're projecting your anger
                          onto us.

                                         JULIEN
                          Oh, Jesus.    We're dead.

               

                                                                           63.

               
               Julien walks away.    Daniel picks up the phone and dials a number.

               

               INT. LAMAR'S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

               The cell phone Daniel gave him rings.      He answers it.

                                          LAMAR
                          Yeah?

                                          DANIEL (V.O.)
                          It's me.

                                       LAMAR
                          Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was
                          just watching the news and--

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (overlapping)
                          -- Did you set it up?

                                       LAMAR
                          Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten
                          o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on
                          River Street. Oh, and due to your recent
                          notoriety and the heat that comes with
                          it, I'm going to have to increase my
                          brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                          We had a deal.

                                       LAMAR
                          We had a deal before you and your friends
                          became the new poster boys for crime.

                                          DANIEL (V.O.)
                          Fine.     Ten o'clock.

               The line goes dead.    Lamar grins, happy with the money he's going
               to make.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The others are looking at Daniel.

                                       DANIEL
                          Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from
                          someone who looks like one of us.

                                          JULIEN
                          What for?

                                       DANIEL
                          We need to rent a car and for that you
                          need a credit card.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Why not just steal another one?

               

                                                                         64.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          Too risky. We don't need to get pulled
                          over because of a stolen car.

                                       JULIEN
                          Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why
                          aren't we leaving town? Any place has
                          to be safer for us than Chicago.

                                       SAMI
                          It doesn't matter where we go. Between
                          Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We
                          have to end this here.

                                       ZERO
                          And how do we do that?

                                          SAMI
                          I don't know.

                                       JULIEN
                          That's an excellent plan.     Very
                          comforting.

                                       DANIEL
                          We'll think of something.

               

               EXT. BONANNO HOUSE -- MORNING

               A Lincoln Town Car drives up. Zammito gets out with Joey "Two
               Tons" and Nicky "The Rake. They wait outside. Zammito enters.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE, STUDY -- MORNING

               Bonanno is behind his desk. Half Tooth Tony sits on the couch.
               Zammito enters. Bonanno walks around his desk and hugs Zammito.

                                       BONANNO
                          Why didn't you tell me about this?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You have enough to worry about, Angelo.
                          You don't need my problems.

               Bonanno places his hands on Zammito's cheeks and presses them
               together.

                                          BONANNO
                          We're family.     An insult to you is an
                          insult to me.

               Bonanno releases him.

                                       BONANNO
                          They knew who you were when they broke
                          in your house?

                                          ZAMMITO
                          Yes.

               

                                                                         65.

               

                                       BONANNO
                          What is happening with the world? There
                          was a time no civilian would touch a
                          made man. Now every babbo in the world
                          thinks he can get away with something.
                          What did they take?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I
                          can replace, but there's a cardboard
                          box... photos of my mother. They're the
                          only ones I have of her.

                                       BONANNO
                          We're doing everything we can to find
                          these people. Right Tony?

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          We've reached out to everyone we know.

                                       BONANNO
                          If they're still stupid enough to be in
                          this city, Tony will find them.

               

               EXT. BONANNO HOUSE -- MORNING

               Zammito steps out onto the street. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
               Rake" are pitching pennies against the wall. They start arguing
               about something.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Frankie, come here a second.

               Zammito walks over.

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?

                                       ZAMMITO
                               (impatiently)
                          Get in the car.

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          Just tell me who's closer to the wall?

               Zammito grabs him by the neck and smashes his face into the wall.

                                        ZAMMITO
                          You are!   Now get in the fuckin' car!

               Both men walk to the car. Zammito starts after them, then stops.
               He turns back, picks up the coins and puts them in his pocket.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- LOBBY -- MORNING

               Sami moves through a crowd of PEOPLE. He looks around until he
               sees a man who looks remarkably similar to Raymond. Sami bumps
               into him and lifts his wallet.

               

                                                                            66.

               

               INT. STEREO STORE -- MORNING

               Marcel waits as a SALESPERSON brings over several boxes of
               electronic equipment.

               

               EXT. LUGGAGE SHOP -- MORNING

               Sami passes the shop. He stops. In the window is BLACK CANVAS
               BAG that is identical to the one that they used on the job. He
               goes into the store.

               

               EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

               An old building that has seen better days.   Daniel and Zero get
               out of a Taxi and go inside.

               

               INT. HALLWAY -- BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

               Looks even worse on the inside. A dark corridor is lit by bare
               light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. An old PROSTITUTE walks
               past them, her smile signaling she is open for business. They
               arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large
               BLACK MAN. Behind him we can see Lamar with ELLWOOD, 20's, sun
               glasses, his neck draped in gold chains.

                                       BLACK GUY
                               (very loud)
                          I'm gonna have to search you.

                                       DANIEL
                          We'll save you the trouble.

               Daniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from Hadley
               in his waistband.

                                        BLACK GUY
                               (loudly)
                          You can't come in here with that.

               Daniel looks past him to Ellwood.

                                       DANIEL
                          What's wrong with this guy?

                                       ELLWOOD
                          He's my cousin. He's deaf.

               Daniel removes an envelope full of cash.

                                        DANIEL
                          We're here to buy, not steal. If you
                          guys are straight there's not going to
                          be a problem.

               Ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor.   The black guy
               feels the vibration and turns around.

                                         ELLWOOD
                          Let them in.

               

                                                                          67.

               
               The black guy steps aside.   Daniel and Zero enter.

               

               INT. BARCLAY HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases
               displaying a variety of weapons.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          What can I do you for?

               Daniel looks over the merchandise.

                                       DANIEL
                          How much for the nines?

                                       ELLWOOD
                          A grand a piece.

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll need extra clips and ammo.

               Daniel starts counting out the money. Ellwood points a .357 magnum
               he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them.

                                       LAMAR
                          What the hell you doing, Ellwood?   I
                          gave them my word.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          Zammito's offering twenty grand a head
                          for these guys. You think I'm going to
                          settle for four G's when I can make forty?
                               (to Daniel)
                          All right. Reach in easy and put the
                          gun on the floor.

               Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks
               it under the bed.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          I said put it on the floor, not kick it
                          under the bed.

               Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each
               word so he can read his lips.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          Get that and add it to my inventory.

               The black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for
               the gun under the bed. As he does Daniel glances over at Zero
               with a look. Ellwood aims his gun at Zero.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          I assume you're carrying too?

               Zero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm.

               

                                                                         68.

               

                                       ELLWOOD
                          Okay, put it on the floor... and do not
                          kick it under the fuckin' bed.

                                             ZERO
                                  (flatly)
                          No.

               He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy,
                          if you're thinking about makin' a move,
                          don't. Nobody is that fast.

                                             ZERO
                          Zero is.

                                             ELLWOOD
                          Who's Zero?

                                             LAMAR
                          He is.

               Ellwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes
               leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of
               movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's
               forehead.

               Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard
               nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up
               the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk
               out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs
               after them.

               A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what
               has transpired in the room.

                                             BLACK GUY
                          Found it!

               

               EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

               Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He
               stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope.

                                       DANIEL
                          There's ten grand in here. It's yours.
                          I'm going to call you again. There's
                          one more thing I need you to do.

                                             LAMAR
                          What?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll tell you when it's time.

               In the background we hear the loud, agonizing scream from the black
               guy as he finds Ellwood's body.

               

                                                                          69.

               

               INT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY

               Raymond and Julien approach the counter.   Raymond is nervous.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not
                          a good liar.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          Relax. It will be fine.

               They arrive at the counter. The RENTAL AGENT, a man in his 30's
               looks up at them with a smile.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                          Hello.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Hello. I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton,
                          Ohio and I would like to rent a car with
                          my visa gold card.

               Raymond smiles, a big, friendly, completely over exaggerated smile.
               Julien looks at him and rolls his eyes. The Rental Agent walks
               down to the end of the counter and dials a number on the phone.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                               (into phone)
                          I got a couple French guys here trying
                          to rent a car.
                               (listens)
                          Sure. I can stall them.

               

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

               Vinny is in bed, his arm in a cast and sling. His wife ANGIE,
               30's, big hair, loud clothes. She sits on the bed feeding him.
               His two kids, RICHIE, 8, and TOMMY 10, sit off to the side. Zammito
               enters.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Angie, how you doin'?

               She kisses him. Vinny stares blankly at his brother. Zammito
               takes a step back, looks her up and down. He lays on the charm.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Hey, you're looking good. There's
                          something different about you. You get
                          a boob job or something?

                                       ANGIE
                          I've gained weight.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah, well, it suits you.

               

                                                                          70.

               
               Zammito moves over to the kids and offers a quick hello.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Hey Tommy.

                                         RICHIE
                          I'm Richie.    He's Tommy.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Whatever.

               Zammito pulls out a roll of bills that could choke a horse and
               peels one off.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Angie, take the kids down to the gift
                          shop and buy 'em something. I need a
                          word with Vinny.

               Angie looks at the money.

                                        ANGIE
                               (flatly)
                          Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we
                          buy?

               She takes the kids and leaves.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          She seems pleasant enough.

                                       VINNY
                          She doesn't know. She thinks I fell
                          down the stairs.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy
                          does.

               Zammito sits on the edge of the bed.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          So, I just come by to see how you're
                          doin'?

                                       VINNY
                          You broke my arm. How the hell do you
                          think I'm doin'?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating
                          you all right? Food okay?

                                       VINNY
                          Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do
                          you want, Frankie?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I don't want anything.

                                                                           71.

               
                                       ZAMMITO (Cont'd)
                          I just wanted to say... that I may have...
                          overreacted a little the other day.

                                          VINNY
                          A little?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and...
                          well I should have found another way of
                          expressing my disappointment. So, I've
                          decided to make it up to you.

                                       VINNY
                          You gonna forget about the money I owe
                          you?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I
                          was thinking I'd throw a little extra
                          work your way. You know, you come down
                          to the club, make espresso for the boys...
                          wash their cars... run some errands...
                          things like that.

               Zammito's cell phone rings.

                                          ZAMMITO
                                  (into phone)
                          Yeah?
                               (his face hardens)
                          I'm on my way.

               Zammito hangs up.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I got something I gotta do. I'm glad we
                          had this talk. Heal. Get better. Let
                          me know when you're ready to start.

               Zammito leaves.    Vinny can only shake his head in bewilderment.

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- DAY

               Sami is recording something on a tape deck Marcel bough. He sees
               Marcel outside on the balcony and removes a piece of paper from
               his pocket, then picks up the phone and dials.

                                          AGENT HADLEY (V.O.)
                          Agent Hadley.

                                       SAMI
                          Do you know who this is?

                                        AGENT HADLEY (V.O.)
                          Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from
                          you.

                                       SAMI
                          If you ever want to get those tapes,
                          meet me in one hour at Grant Park near
                          the statue.

               

               INT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY

               The Rental Agent walks back over to Raymond and Julien.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                          I'm sorry about the wait. There was a
                          problem with the equipment.

                                       JULIEN
                          Everything okay now?

               The Rental Agent's eyes drift to a black Lincoln Town Car parked
               across the street.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                          Everything's fine.

               

               EXT. STREET, ACROSS FROM CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY

               A Lincoln pulls up. Zammito gets out and walks over to three
               WISEGUYS in another Town Car. One of the Wiseguys points to the
               window of the rental agency. Zammito looks at Raymond and Julien.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I don't know the little one, but the
                          other guy is definitely one of them.
                          Follow them and call me when you find
                          out where they go.

               Zammito walks back to his car and drives off.

               

                                                                          73.

               

               EXT. CAR RENTAL LOT -- DAY

               An EMPLOYEE drives up in a CADILLAC DE VILLE.   He gets out and
               Julien grabs the keys from him.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          I'll drive.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I'm the driver.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          I've never driven a Cadillac before.

               Raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac moves down the street.   The Lincoln follows a few
               cars behind them.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Julien drives the car.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          This is a car. I think this is the best
                          American car I've ever driven.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          This is the only American car you've
                          ever driven.

               

               EXT. GRANT PARK -- DAY

               Agent Hadley walks towards the statue wearing a pair of sun glasses.
               As he approaches, Sami steps out.

                                       SAMI
                          You set me up, you piece of shit!

               Hadley pushes him up against the statue and starts frisking him.

                                       SAMI
                          What are you doing?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You think I'm going to talk to you until
                          I know if you're wired.

                                         SAMI
                          Wired?    I ain't wired.

               

                                                                          74.

               
               Sami lifts up his shirt showing Hadley his bare chest.   He drops
               his pants down to his ankles.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.

                                       SAMI
                          You killed her!

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          No. You killed her. Manager remembers
                          you going into her room. Your
                          fingerprints were found all over the
                          place.

                                        SAMI
                          Bullshit! She was alive when we left
                          her with you.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's
                          why you're here.

                                       SAMI
                          Look, I just want out of this nightmare.
                          I don't know these guys. A few days ago
                          I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm
                          America's most wanted.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Where are the tapes?

                                       SAMI
                          I can get them -- but what do I get if I
                          do?

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          A pass.

                                       SAMI
                          A pass? How you gonna give me a pass?
                          A witness can put me at the crime scene.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Witness' can be convinced they made a
                          mistake. Without the murder weapon the
                          D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.

                                       SAMI
                          They don't have a murder weapon?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          No. I have it. The lamp? The one with
                          your fingerprints and her blood on it?
                               (holds up his burned
                                hand)
                          Remember?

               

                                                                            75.

               
               Sami is stunned, then his thoughts snap back to...

               

                                                                        CUT TO:

               Sami picking up the brass lamp off the nightstand and leaving his
               fingerprints all over it.

               

                                                                    CUT BACK TO:

               

               EXT. GRANT PARK -- DAY

               Sami stares angrily at Hadley who appears to be enjoying his
               frustration.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Of course they could always get an
                          anonymous tip. Find it in the dumpster
                          behind the motel.

               Sami stares at him a long moment.

                                       SAMI
                          You want the tapes for yourself.     You're
                          going to sell them.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'm going to retire with a shit-load of
                          money. Find me a small country that
                          doesn't have an extradition treaty with
                          the States and live the good life.

                                       SAMI
                          You didn't have to kill Sophie.

                                         AGENT HADLEY
                          Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

                                       SAMI
                          What about me? Aren't I a loose end?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          When this is over you can say whatever
                          the hell you want. I'll be long gone.
                          Besides, who's going to believe you?
                          You're just a two-bit crook.

                                       SAMI
                          And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't
                          pretend to be something different than
                          what I am.

               Hadley hands him a card.

               

                                                                           76.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          When you've got the tapes call me on
                          this number. We'll make the exchange
                          and that'll be the end of it.

               Hadley leaves.

               

               EXT. GRAND AVENUE -- DAY

               Julien drives the Cadillac along the North River.   The Lincoln
               keeps pace with them several cars behind.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Raymond clicks through a few Radio Stations.   Julien glances in
               his rear view mirror.
               HIS POV - IN THE MIRROR:   of the Lincoln several cars back.
               Julien seems concerned.    He turns the steering wheel hard to the
               right.

               

               EXT. GRAND AVENUE -- DAY

               The Cadillac cuts across the right lane almost hitting a car and
               turns onto another street. The Lincoln makes a sharp move to stay
               up with it.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- DAY

               Raymond looks over at Julien.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          We're being followed.

               Julien hits the gas.

               

               EXT. WELL STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac speeds down the street, weaving in and out of traffic.
               The Lincoln does the same. The Cadillac reaches an intersection.
               The traffic ahead of them is stopped for a red light. The Cadillac
               veers onto the sidewalk. Pedestrians jump out of the way and the
               car streaks down the pavement. Behind the Lincoln follows.

               

               EXT. OHIO STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac screeches around the corner, onto a ONE WAY STREET.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Julien concentrates as he weaves the car in and out of the on coming
               traffic.

               

                                                                          77.

               

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I knew I should have driven.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               The oncoming traffic veers off. Cars collide. The Lincoln clips
               a car, loses control for a moment, then continues after them. At
               the corner the Cadillac turns onto another street and joins traffic
               in the right direction.

               

               EXT. FRANKLIN STREET -- DAY

               The Lincoln moves up along side the Cadillac. Two WISEGUYS lean
               out the window with guns in their hands. The Cadillac veers away
               just as they start shooting. Bullets riddle the car.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Raymond removes Hadley's backup gun. The Lincoln pulls up beside
               them again. The sound of GUN FIRE fills the air as Raymond shoots
               from the Cadillac. The rear passenger window of the Lincoln
               shatters and Raymond fires. The Lincoln drops back.

               

               EXT. HUBBARD STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac turns the corner. The Lincoln follows. The traffic
               is heavier here. The cars have to slow down. The Lincoln moves
               beside them again. Raymond fires his last shot. His gun his now
               empty. Several rounds of gun fire come from the Lincoln.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Raymond looks over to Julien.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          What are we going to --
               His voice trails off as he sees Julien. A bullet has glanced his
               neck, not deep, but deep enough to sever an artery. Blood pours
               down his neck and covers his shirt. His face is pale. He glances
               at the wound in the rear view mirror.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Julien steers the caddy onto another street.   The towncar follows.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Julien looks at Raymond. He is paler now, his shirt completely
               covered with blood. He strains to stay conscious.

               

                                                                           78.

               

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          When we get to the next corner jump out.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I'm not going to leave you.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          We both know I'm already dead.

               Raymond knows he's right.   The car races into the next turn.

                                        JULIEN
                                (in French)
                          Go!
               Raymond opens the door.
               He jumps out.

               

               INT. LINCOLN - DRIVER'S POV -- DAY

               Of Raymond as he rolls towards the curb.    The Caddy skids around
               the corner.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               The Lincoln slams on it's brakes in the middle of an intersection.
               Raymond is dazed from his fall. He gets up slowly, his pants torn
               and sees..

               

               P.O.V. RAYMOND OF THE TOWNCAR -- DAY
               The driver is reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and
               is just about to shoot when...

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Julien comes racing into the intersection full speed and smashes
               into the Lincoln. The impact sends the Lincoln spinning around.
               When it stops the driver's window is facing the front of the caddy.
               The driver of the caddy takes aim and fires.   The bullet goes
               through the windshield and kills Julien.
               The driver looks over at the passenger just in time to see...

               

               P.O.V. A LARGE TRUCK -- DAY
               Speeds through the intersection and smashes head on into the
               Lincoln. It crumbles like a toy under the weight.

               

                                                                          79.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Raymond limps into the street oblivious to the oncoming traffic.
               He stares sadly at Julien.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- AFTERNOON

               Zero and Marcel are checking over the guns. Daniel writes some
               notes on a pad of paper. Sami appears nervous as he sits off to
               the side.
               The door opens. Raymond limps into the room. His face is dirty,
               bruised, his pants torn, legs scraped. He stands there, staring
               at them through empty eyes.
               Daniel looks at the door expectantly.   He knows the answer before
               he asks the question.

                                         DANIEL
                          Julien?
               Raymond's face fills with sadness.   He shakes his.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE-- LATER -- DUSK

               There is a cold silence in the room. Daniel stares at the sliding
               glass door, staring out over the city.

                                       SAMI
                          It's not your fault, Daniel.

                                         DANIEL
                          No?

               He looks at them sadly.

                                       DANIEL
                          We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's
                          house.

                                       MARCEL
                          We all agreed to it. You had no way of
                          knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.

                                       DANIEL
                          I just want to live long enough to get
                          back to Paris. Just long enough to kill
                          Bastaldi.

                                       SAMI
                          I say we make him pay first. After that
                          you can do whatever you want to him.

                                       RAYMOND
                          He's right. Do you have any idea what
                          Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers"
                          is worth?

               

                                                                         80.

               

                                        MARCEL
                          No.   How much?

                                          RAYMOND
                          I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

                                       DANIEL
                          We still have to get out of here.

                                       MARCEL
                          Maybe if we gave the tapes back --

                                        ZERO
                                (strongly)
                          No.

               Everyone looks to Zero.

                                       ZERO
                          They killed our friend. It's personal
                          now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien
                          died for nothing. The tapes are the
                          key.

                                       SAMI
                          He's right. The tapes give us leverage
                          with Bastaldi.

               

               INT. AGENT HADLEY'S APARTMENT -- EVENING

               Agent Hadley sits on his couch, deep in thought. He glances at
               the paper with Raymond's phone number on the coffee table. A beat.
               He gets an idea. He picks up his phone and dials.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Hello? Mrs. Gayet? Do you speak English?
                               (listens)
                          You do. Great.
                               (listens)
                          Oh, you taught Raymond English. You did
                          a wonderful job. I'm sorry to call so
                          late but I'm supposed to meet Raymond --
                               (listens)
                          No, I didn't know he was a difficult
                          child. Mrs. Gayet, I'm calling because --
                               (listens)
                          No, I don't have any children of my own.
                          I'm supposed to meet Raymond tonight at
                          his hotel and I forgot what Hotel he is
                          at. I wondering if you --
                               (listens)
                          The Holiday Hotel. Room 912. Thank you
                          very much.

               

               EXT. HUBBARD STREET -- EVENING

               Tow trucks and cleaning crews work around wreckage of the cars.
               Only a few POLICE CARS are there.

               

                                                                          81.

               
               A UNIFORMED COP looks over and sees Joey "Two Tons" on the sidewalk.
               Joey motions with his head to an alley.

               

               EXT. ALLEY -- EVENING

               The Uniformed Cop enters the alley and joins Joey.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What'd you guys find?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln
                          are your... associates.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          And the other car?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          Some French guy. At least that's what
                          his passport said. You know Joey, I
                          shouldn't be talking to you about this.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Are you forgetting who supplements your
                          income?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          No. It's just that the French guy had a
                          gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is
                          a homicide. Are you guys involved in
                          this?

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Yeah. I'll come down and make a full
                          confession later. Right now, tell me
                          what else you found?

                                         UNIFORMED COP
                          A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

               This sparks Joey's interest.

                                          JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What hotel?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          The Holiday Hotel.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What room number?

                                          UNIFORMED COP
                          I don't know.     I didn't look.

                                          JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Go look.

               

                                                                           82.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The crew sits around a table trying to figure out how they can get
               out of town.

                                       DANIEL
                          Okay. Airports, train stations, bus
                          station are out. We know they're
                          connected to the car rental agencies
                          because that's where they picked up
                          Raymond.

                                       SAMI
                          Even if we get out of town and go to
                          another airport I'm sure the FBI and
                          Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

                                       MARCEL
                          How about Canada?

                                       RAYMOND
                          What are we going to do, take a taxi?

               Sami opens a pack of cigarettes to find it's empty.

                                       SAMI
                          I'm going to get some cigarettes.

               

               INT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING

               Because of the early hour the room is empty. Raphael and Hector
               are with FREDDY O, 30's, hard-looking. He is wearing a bus boy
               uniform as he sets the tables.

                                       FREDDY O
                          I can't believe someone would have the
                          balls to rip off your ride.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          When I find them they won't have them
                          for much longer.

                                       FREDDY O
                          I'll ask around. If they try to move it
                          I can find out.

                                          RAPHAEL
                          Thanks.

               Raphael and Hector exit.    We move with them through the door into...

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL LOBBY -- EVENING

               Raphael and Hector head for the front door. The elevator doors
               opens and Sami exits. They walk past each other as Sami heads
               across the lobby and into the gift shop. As Raphael and Hector
               walk out the front door Agent Hadley steps in walks past them. He
               goes over to a WOMAN CLERK at the front desk.

               

                                                                          83.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'd like to see the manager please.

               She walks over to the HOTEL MANAGER and points to Agent Hadley.
               The Manager walks over.

                                       HOTEL MANAGER
                          May I help you?

               Agent Hadley shows him his badge.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'm looking for several French men who
                          checked in within the last twenty four
                          hours.

                                       HOTEL MANAGER
                          They checked in last night.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I need you to take me to their room.

               Agent Hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators
               and pass... Sami who pretends to read a magazine, covering his
               face so Hadley will not see him. Sami walks quickly across the
               lobby and passes...

               Joey "Two Tons", Nicky "The Rake" and three other WISEGUYS enter
               the hotel. Agent Hadley gets in an elevator with the Hotel Manager.
               The doors close as the wiseguys approach.

               The moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to
               the house phones. All of them are being used except one. A MAN
               is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside.

                                        MAN
                          Excuse me.   I was here first.

               Sami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer.
               The phone just rings and rings.
               Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter.
               Sami's frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring.    The
               Man who Sami pushed away is still there.

                                       MAN
                          Hey buddy, you just can't push in here.

                                        SAMI
                          Go away.

                                       MAN
                          I most certainly will not go--

               Sami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver.   The man
               slinks away.

                                        OPERATOR'S VOICE
                          Operator.

               

                                                                           84.

               

                                       SAMI
                               (into phone)
                          Room 912.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The phone rings.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Raymond)
                          Get that, will you?

                                       RAYMOND
                          Why do I always have to answer the phone?

                                       DANIEL
                          Because you're the closest.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I'm not any closer than you are.

               

               INT. ELEVATOR -- EVENING

               The wiseguys watch the floor indicator.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The phone continues RINGING.

                                       DANIEL
                          Why is everything an argument with you?

                                       RAYMOND
                          I'm just setting my boundaries.

               Daniel looks at Raymond and sighs, then gets up and lifts he
               receiver.

                                          DANIEL
                          Hello?

                                       SAMI (V.O.)
                          Get out of the room! You've got company
                          coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

               Daniel slams down the phone.    The others can see the urgency on
               his face.

                                       DANIEL
                          Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!

                                       RAYMOND
                          Why do I have to pick up the tapes.

                                          DANIEL
                          Jesus!

               Daniel grabs the canvas bag.

               

                                                                           85.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING

               The manager is about to open the door with his key.   Agent Hadley
               takes it and removes a gun.

                                         AGENT HADLEY
                            You should go now.

               The manager runs away. Agent Hadley inserts the key and opens the
               door. His face fills with fear as he sees...
               AGENT HADLEY'S POV -- Daniel, Marcel, Raymond and Zero are on the
               other side, their guns pointed at Hadley's head.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM -- EVENING

               Daniel uses Hadley's handcuffs and handcuffs him to a pipe under
               the sink.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING

               Daniel, Raymond, Marcel and Zero step into the hall. The moment
               they do the elevator doors at the end of the hall open. The
               Wiseguys step out and see them.
               The door to the room next to theirs opens and a LITTLE GIRL, 8,
               dressed in a pink dress steps out.

                                          LITTLE GIRL
                                 (calling into her
                                  room)
                            C'mon, Mommy.

               Everything seems to move in slow motion.
               --   The Wiseguys go for their guns.
               --   The crew goes for theirs.
               --   The little girl is caught between both groups.
               --   Marcel lunges forward, tackling the girl to ground.
               --   The Wiseguys begin to shoot.
               --   The hallway fills with gunfire.
               --   Marcel pulls the little girl into her room.
               --   Plaster explodes off the walls as bullets rip through them.
               --   The Crew rushes back into their suite.

               

               INT. LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM -- EVENING

               Marcel hands the frightened girl to her mother, then moves over to
               the door that joins with the crews. He shoots the lock and moves
               through the door.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               As Marcel steps through he sees the crew all aiming their guns at
               him. Daniel gets an idea. As Zero holds off the Wiseguys from
               the doorway, Daniel goes to the adjoining door on the other side
               of the suite. He shoots off the lock.

               

                                                                          86.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          Let's go!
               The Crew moves through the door.

               

               INT. ADJOINING MOTEL ROOM -- EVENING

               Empty. The crew runs across to the door. Because the room is
               built at the intersection of two hallways the crew step out into a
               corridor out of the Wiseguys line of sight.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- BACK HALLWAY -- EVENING

               The Crew exits and heads for the staircase.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- FRONT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               Silence. The Wiseguys move down the hall and stop outside the
               door of the Crew's suite. A beat. They rush in.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- CONTINUOUS

               Empty. Nicky "The Rake" sees the open adjoining door and motions
               for them to follow him.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- BACK HALLWAY -- EVENING

               The Wiseguys step out just as the Crew are going through the door
               to the stairwell. The Wiseguys run after them. Joey "Two Tons"
               lags behind.

               

               INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING

               The Crew runs down the stairs. Above them the Wiseguys follow.
               Joey "Two Tons" is breathing heavily as he runs down the stairs.

               

               INT. UNDER GROUND PARKING LOT -- EVENING

               The door flies open as the Crew runs across the lot.   Sami has
               already started the Impala and is waiting for them.
               A moment later the stairwell door opens and the Wiseguys run out,
               guns blazing.

               The Crew heads for the Impala, shooting behind them as they run.
               Nicky "The Rake"" shoots.

               Zero is hit in the leg. He falls to the ground, then rolls on his
               side behind a parked car. He fights through the pain, props himself
               up and begins to shoot back.

               Two Wiseguys step out to flank Zero. Zero takes aim and shoots
               one. He lines up on the other Wiseguy and pulls the trigger again.
               Click! His gun his empty.

               

                                                                             87.

               
               Daniel and Marcel run towards Zero, firing their guns as fast as
               they can pull the trigger. Marcel takes aim and fires.
               The Wiseguy's dive for cover as Marcel blazes away until his gun
               is empty.

               We hear tires screeching as the Impala backs up.
               The Wiseguys shoot, blowing out the back window.     They move in on
               Marcel and Zero.

               Daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys.     As he
               nears Marcel he throws the extra gun to him.
               SLOW MOTION :on the gun as it flies through the air.
               SLOW MOTION: One of the WISEGUYS has almost circle around the car.
               SLOW MOTION: on the gun has it flies through the air.
               REAL TIME -- ON MARCEL: He looks to his left just as the gun
               arrives. It hits him on the forehead and knocks him down.

               Daniel fires a few SHOTS driving the Wiseguy back. He runs over
               and with Marcel's help they grab Zero and help him to the car.
               They dive into the back seat. The car screeches forward and races
               out of the garage.

               Silence. The staircase door opens and an exhausted Joey "Two Tons"
               steps out, gasping for air.

               

               INT. IMPALA -- MOVING -- EVENING

               Daniel attends to the wound on Zero's leg.

                                       DANIEL
                          The bullet went clean through.

               Daniel stares at him.   A beat.     Zero grins, saying thank you.

               

               INT. COFFEE SHOP -- EVENING

               A distraught Raphael sits across from Hector in a booth near the
               window. Hector has almost finished eating. Raphael hasn't touched
               his food. He pushes his plate away.

                                         RAPHAEL
                          I can't eat.

               Raphael lowers his head sadly.      Hector looks out the window.
               HIS POV -- of the Impala driving by -- rear window missing, bumper
               about to fall off.
               Hector watches it go by, then turns back.     Raphael looks up.

                                       HECTOR
                          So, can I have your fries?

               

                                                                            88.

               

               EXT. COZY COURT COTTAGES -- EVENING

               A group of small bungalows built adjacent to the interstate.

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- EVENING

               Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off
               to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his
               belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table
               staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes.
               Marcel is in the kitchenette.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Zero)
                          When we get back to Paris I'll take you
                          dancing.

               Zero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag.      He places it
               on the counter.

                                       DANIEL
                          Bring me the scissors.

                                       ZERO
                          And the Vodka.

               Sami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands
               it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls.

                                       DANIEL
                          Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.

                                       ZERO
                          And be careful when you get near the
                          top. Zero has a very long one.

               He winks at Sami.

                                       SAMI
                          What's he joking around for?    He's been
                          shot.

                                       DANIEL
                          He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

               Raymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who
               is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench,
               the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes
               some white bread.

                                       SAMI
                          Anybody hungry?

                                       DANIEL
                          What'd you get?

                                       SAMI
                          Some bread and...

               

                                                                         89.

               
               He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the
               bread.

                                        SAMI
                          Cheese.

               All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet.

                                        DANIEL
                          Cheese?   In a can?

               Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite.

                                        SAMI
                          It's good.

                                       MARCEL
                          God, I want to go home.

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, you know you can't this in France.

                                        DANIEL
                          Thank God.

               Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to
               the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about
               to happen.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Zero)
                          Ready?

               Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over
               the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases
               the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot
               poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His
               face contorts violently from the pain.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- EVENING

               Zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta.
               DEAN MARTIN "Innamaraia" plays on the stereo. EDDIE, 60's,
               arthritic, finishes making an espresso. He starts carrying it
               over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in
               front of the other. Zammito watches him with strained patience.
               Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" enter. Their faces tell the
               story.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          What happened?

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          They sort of got away.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I see. Well, get back out on the street
                          and find them before I "sort of" kill
                          you.

               

                                                                              90.

               

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          But we ain't had nothing to eat all day
                          boss.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Oh, I'm sorry.

               Zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws
               it at him.

                                          ZAMMITO
                          Had enough?

               Joey "Two Tons" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are
               stuck to his face. Zammito walks over to him.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Try to get this through that fat, stupid
                          fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth
                          Tony finds these guys before we do and
                          Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are
                          all dead.

               They turn around and leave.       Zammito stares after them angrily.

                                          ZAMMITO
                          Cafones!

               He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You gonna bring that over here today, or
                          what?

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Zero is passed out, a half empty Vodka bottle on the nightstand.
               The others have been up all night. Raymond is across the table
               from Sami.

                                       RAYMOND
                          The new Beaujolais' come out in France
                          next week. You like wine?

                                       SAMI
                          I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.

                                          RAYMOND

                          J&B?

                                          SAMI
                          Glenmorangie.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Glenmorangie is very good.

               Sami realizes that Raymond wants to talk about something...
               anything... that will get his mind of the events that have lead
               them here.

               

                                                                           91.

               

                                       SAMI
                          But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with
                          you when we get back.

               Raymond forces a weak smile. Daniel who has been watching them
               grabs a few things off the table.

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll be back in an hour.

               Daniel looks at Sami and motions for him to come outside.

               

               EXT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Sami steps outside.   Daniel is staring at him.

                                         SAMI
                          What?

                                       DANIEL
                          Can I trust you, Sami?

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, who warned you that they were coming
                          up to the room?

                                       DANIEL
                          If they had taken us by surprise they
                          would have gotten the tapes back. That
                          would have left us with nothing.

                                       SAMI
                          No, that would have left me with nothing
                          because all of you would be dead.

                                       DANIEL
                          You haven't answered my question.

                                       SAMI
                          Does it really matter what I say?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm
                          trusting you to do the right thing today.

                                         SAMI
                          I will.

                                         DANIEL
                          You better.

               

               EXT. BONANNO'S HOUSE -- MORNING

               Daniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell.   Half Tooth
               Tony opens the door and looks him up and down.

                                         HALF TOOTH TONY
                          Yeah?

               

                                                                          92.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          Who the hell are you?

                                       DANIEL
                          Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie
                          Zammito.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S FOYER -- MORNING

               Half Tooth Tony searches Daniel. He finds a small cassette player,
               glances at it and sticks it back in Daniel's pocket.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                               (points to a door)
                          In there.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

               Daniel enters. Half Tooth Tony stands behind him, his eyes locked
               on Daniel's every move. Bonanno is sitting in an armchair.

                                       BONANNO
                          Either you are incredibly brave, or
                          incredibly stupid. Which one is it?

                                       DANIEL
                          I guess we're going to find out.

                                       BONANNO
                          You rob an associate of mine... a friend
                          and--

                                       DANIEL
                               (overlapping)
                          Not such a good friend.   May I reach in
                          my pocket?

               Bonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony.

                                        HALF TOOTH TONY
                          He's clean.

               Bonanno nods.   Daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Of course. I need an answer from you if
                          I'm going to move.

                                       MAN'S VOICE
                          We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of
                          work' here Frankie. We're talking about
                          a boss.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Bonanno's a dinosaur.
                                       (More)

               

                                                                          93.

               
                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE (Cont'd)
                          Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or
                          something. The old ways are gone. If
                          we don't change now we're going to get
                          pushed out. I need to know if I can
                          count on your support?

               Daniel turns off the tape.   Bonanno's anger is visible.

                                       DANIEL
                          I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This
                          guy's an idiot. How he's lived this
                          long is a mystery.

                                       BONANNO
                               (seething)
                          I don't think it will be a mystery much
                          longer.

                                       DANIEL
                          He's recorded every conversation he's
                          had with you for years.

                                       BONANNO
                          I assume you want something?

                                       DANIEL
                          We've got a lot of people looking for
                          us. We'd just like to go home.

                                       BONANNO
                          You want me to help you get out of the
                          country?

               Daniel nods.

                                       BONANNO
                          And for my help I would get what?

                                       DANIEL
                          Half the tapes.

                                       BONANNO
                          And the other half?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll destroy them when we get back to
                          Paris.

                                       BONANNO
                          I only have your word for that.

                                       DANIEL
                          I just want to get my people home. I
                          know who you are and what you could do
                          to me if I don't honor my word.

                                       BONANNO
                          Where are you staying?

               

                                                                             94.

               
               Daniel grins.   He isn't going to tell him.

                                       BONANNO
                          I only ask so I can call you when the
                          arrangements are made.

                                       DANIEL
                          How about if I call you?

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Zero and Raymond are sleeping. We hear the shower running in the
               bathroom. Sami is at the table. The black canvas bag containing
               the tapes is on the table. Sami removes the identical canvas bag
               he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the
               table. He takes the original and leaves.

               

               EXT. COZY COURTS -- MORNING

               Sami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone
               and dials. A taxi pulls up.

                                         SAMI
                          Same place.    One hour.

               Sami gets in the taxi and it drives away.     A beat.   A moment later
               another taxi pulls up. Daniel gets out.

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Daniel enters to find Zero and Raymond still sleeping. He looks
               at the black canvas bag on the table. Marcel steps out of the
               bathroom wrapped in a towel.

               

               EXT. GRANT PARK -- MORNING

               Hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box.     Sami
               walks towards him holding the black canvas bag.

                                       SAMI
                          What the fuck was all that about at the
                          hotel last night? I thought we had a
                          deal?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Hey, you're not exactly the most
                          trustworthy guy in the world. I took a
                          shot. It didn't work. Did you bring
                          the tapes?

               Sami holds up the canvas bag.

                                         SAMI
                          The lamp?

               Hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base.
               Sami hands him the canvas bag.

               

                                                                             95.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Just a second. You must think I'm a
                          real moron.

               Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.    He picks
               a tape and inserts it into the player.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          I just came by to tell that "piece of
                          work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks --
                          It's done.

                                        BONANNO'S VOICE
                          Good.   How'd he go?

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Like the crying rat bastard that he was.

               Hadley stops the tape.   He inserts another one.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this
                          guy. He's a congressman.

                                       BONANNO'S VOICE
                          I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We
                          pay him each month to look after our
                          interests.

               Hadley grins.   This is great stuff.   He looks up at Sami.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Here you go, sport.

               Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and
               walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops
               out with two of his friends. All of them have guns.

                                       LAMAR
                          I'll take the bag.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You don't think I see through this?     You
                          tell Sami he's dead.

               One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his
               gun, then takes his wallet.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're making a big mistake.    I'm an FBI
                          agent.

               Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on
               his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops
               the canvas bag.

               Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there
               fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it.

               ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE

               

                                                                           96.

               
               Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag.   As Lamar
               passes they quickly exchange bags.

               From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue
               as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then
               stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.
               Lamar's buddies are already at the street.

                                        LAMAR'S BUDDIES
                          C'mon, man!   Let's get out of here.

               Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked.   He runs
               off leaving the bag laying on the grass.

               ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the
               loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.

               ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as
               Hadley walks off in the other direction.

               

               EXT. STREET CORNER -- MORNING

               Daniel arrives to find Sami and Lamar.

                                       SAMI
                          See, I told you that you could trust me.

               Daniel grins and pats him on the back.

                                       LAMAR
                          Okay, we're square now, right?

                                       DANIEL
                          There's just one more thing I need you
                          to do.

               Lamar is about to protest when Daniel takes out a roll of bills.

                                       LAMAR
                          I'm listening.

               

               INT. TAXI -- MOVING -- DAY

               Daniel and Sami sit in the back.   Daniel is on his cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                               (into phone)
                          Mr. Bonanno, I was wondering if you--
                               (listens)
                          That would be fine. Thank you.

               

               INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

               Hadley enters with the black canvas bag.    The RECEPTIONIST hands
               him a package.

                                       RECEPTIONIST
                          This came for you.

               

                                                                          97.

               

               INT. HADLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. Hadley pops
               the cassette into the VCR. On the screen we see Sami speaking
               into a video camera.

                                       SAMI
                          Since we're such good pals I thought I'd
                          sneak you an advanced copy of my latest
                          work. I call it, "I am a scum-sucking
                          FBI agent".

               On the television screen we see Hadley and Sami in the park on
               their first meeting.

                                       SAMI
                          You want the tapes for yourself.     You're
                          going to sell them.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'm going to retire with a shit-load of
                          money. Find me a small country that
                          doesn't have an extradition treaty with
                          the States and live the good life.

                                       SAMI
                          You didn't have to kill Sophie.

                                         AGENT HADLEY
                          Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

               The color drains from Hadley's face.   Sami reappears, talking into
               the camera again.

                                       SAMI
                          It's a little arty I know, but it has
                          great content, don't you think? You
                          were so busy looking for a wire you
                          probably didn't even think about a video
                          camera. It was on the statue. Anyway,
                          I've sent a copy of the whole tape to
                          the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll
                          get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take
                          the day off.

               The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the
               VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to
               dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses
               his cell phone.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY

               Eddie is on the phone.   Zammito is at his usual table.

                                       EDDIE
                          Hey boss, some guy named Hadley.     Says
                          he's got some tapes you want?

               Zammito springs out of his seat and grabs the phone.

               

                                                                          98.

               

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Yeah?
                               (listens)
                          How much? Are you nuts?
                               (listens)
                          Okay. Okay. There's an old warehouse
                          on Merchant Street...

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY

               Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" rush to the car carrying a briefcase.

               

               EXT. VINNY ZAMMITO'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Raymond knocks on the door.   Vinny answers it, his arm in sling.

                                         RAYMOND
                          Mr. Zammito?

                                         VINNY
                          Uh huh.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I represent a person who wishes to remain
                          anonymous, but is aware of your current
                          financial problems with your brother.

                                       VINNY
                          I don't know what you're talking about.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I understand. The person who sent me
                          wishes to help you.

                                         VINNY
                          How?

                                       RAYMOND
                          You see that car?

               Vinny looks on the street and sees the Impala.

                                         VINNY
                          Yeah.

                                       RAYMOND
                          It's yours. A gift. A gift you could
                          give to your brother... or anyone you
                          owe money to as partial payment.

                                         VINNY
                          No shit?

                                       RAYMOND
                          The papers for the car will arrive
                          tomorrow.

               

                                                                              99.

               

               EXT.   MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               An old building, dirty windows and peeling paint.       The main door
               is open.

               

               INT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" are standing next to Zammito's Lincoln.
               Hadley parks ten yards away and gets out with the black canvas
               bag.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           Those the tapes?

               Hadley starts to place the canvas bag on the hood of Zammito's
               car.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           Watch the paint.

               Hadley opens the bag.     It is filled with cassette tapes.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                           The money?

               Zammito nods to Joey "Two Tons" who opens another briefcase filled
               with cash.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           How'd you get these?

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                           I got 'em.    That's all you need to know.

               Hadley starts to go.     Zammito motions him to stop.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           Just a second.

               Zammito picks a tape and tosses it to Joey "Two Tons." Who puts
               the cassette into the cars cassette player. Suddenly we hear Wayne
               Newton singing "Danke Schoen."

                                        WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
                           Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen.
                           Thank you for all the joy and pain...

               Hadley's face turns white.     He produces an audible gulp as he looks
               at Zammito weakly.

               

               EXT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               The music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building.

                                        WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
                           Pictures show, second balcony, was the
                           place we'd meet...

               Through the dirty windows we see several flashes as the air fills
               with gunfire.

               

                                                                         100.

                          ... second seat, go Dutch treat, you
                          were so sweet...

               Zammito's Lincoln pulls out of the warehouse and drives down the
               street.

               

               INT. LINCOLN -- MOVING -- AFTERNOON

               Music continues in the cassette deck.   Joey "Two Tons" drives.
               Zammito sits in the passenger seat.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                               (referring to cassette)
                          Good song though.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Great fuckin' song.

               

               EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- AFTERNOON

               Sami, Marcel and Raymond help Zero out of the taxi and towards a
               small plane. Off to the side Bonanno is standing with Half Tooth
               Tony. Daniel walks over to him.

                                       BONANNO
                          This plane will take you to Canada.
                          From there you can fly back to Paris.

                                         DANIEL
                          Thank you.

                                       BONANNO
                          You have something for me?

               Daniel hands him the cassette case with half the tapes. Bonanno
               hands it to Half Tooth Tony who takes them into the car and listens
               to a tape.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          They're good, boss.

                                       BONANNO
                          And the other half of the tapes?

                                       DANIEL
                          You have my word. I'll destroy them.

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln pulls up. Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" get out.   Vinny
               is waiting beside the Impala.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          What's this?

               

                                                                           101.

                          A car.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a
                          sewing machine. What the hell is it
                          doing here?

                                           VINNY
                          It's for you.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          For me? What am I going to do with a
                          piece of shit like this?

                                       VINNY
                          I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be
                          worth something. Someone gave it to me.
                          C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good
                          here.

                                           ZAMMITO
                          Okay.    Okay.

                                       VINNY
                          I'll get you the papers tomorrow.

               Vinny starts to walk away.

                                        ZAMMITO
                                (yelling after him)
                          Hey, if you're well enough to be walking
                          around you're well enough to start working
                          here.

               

               EXT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT -- AFTERNOON

               A gang hang out. Raphael is with several hard-looking gang-bangers.
               Lamar arrives with two of his friends.

                                           RAPHAEL
                          You lost?

                                       LAMAR
                          Don't come off like a hard-on with me.
                          I'm about to make you a very happy man.

               

               EXT. GANG HANGOUT -- AFTERNOON

               Several Gang Bangers stand around their low rider cars. Sananta's
               "Oye Como Va" plays loudly on one of the radios. Raphael talks
               heatedly with several of the gang bangers.

               

               A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
               Music continues as several gang members check their guns.

               

                                                                         102.

               

               EXT. STREET -- AFTERNOON

               The Santana song continues as several car loads of Gang Bangers
               drive down the street.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               The air is thick with cigar smoke. Several GUMBAS hang around the
               bar. Zammito is at his table with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
               Rake." DEAN MARTIN "Return To me" plays on the jukebox.
               Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a
               stop. The door opens and Raphael and ten other very tough-looking
               GANG MEMBERS step inside. The room falls silent, except for Dino
               on the jukebox. Zammito stands up.

                                         RAPHAEL
                            Anybody know about that car outside?

                                          ZAMMITO
                            Yeah.   It's mine.

                                          RAPHAEL
                            No.   It's mine.

                                         ZAMMITO
                            The hell it is.

                                         RAPHAEL
                            I'm telling you that's my car!   And
                            someone's gonna pay for it!

                                         ZAMMITO
                            And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn
                            your taco-eating ass around and get the
                            hell out of here.

                                         RAPHAEL
                            Fuck you, grease-ball!

                                          ZAMMITO
                            Fuck me?   Fuck you!

               They are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean
               Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to
               see who's going to make the first move.
               The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against
               the vinyl intro. We hear the intro to JERRY VALE singing "Amore
               Scusami".

               

               SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
               --   Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's
               --   A Gang-Bangers eyes dart from side to side.
               --   A Wiseguy bites his lip.
               --   Nicky "The Rake" twitches his fingers nervously.
               --   Sweat glistens on the forehead of Joey "Two Tons".

               

                                                                         103.

               
               At the bar Eddie reaches behind for something without looking. He
               knocks over a bottle. It falls to the floor and breaks. The noise
               is enough to push things over the edge.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          My love, forgive me...

               Raphael goes for his gun.   All hell breaks loose! People dive for
               cover as shots rings out.   In the close quarters it's like shooting
               fish in a barrel.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          I didn't mean to have it end like this...

               Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang
               member. Another gang member kills him.
               It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick
               with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is
               quiet.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          I didn't mean to have you fall in love,
                          in love with me...

               We move through the room, past the carnage. Smoke swirls, blood
               covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey "Two Tons"
               and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar.
               He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and
               makes his way to the front door.

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               Music continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street.
               He laughs, a nervous laugh at his good fortune.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          My love, please kiss me...

               Zammito turns around to see
               ZAMMITO'S POV -- A Lincoln Town car speeding towards him. Through
               the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony.
               The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.
               He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over
               the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead.
               The Lincoln speeds off down the street.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE

               Music continues. Bonanno sits on his couch, eating a cannoli as
               he watches Judge Judy on television..

               

                                                                          104.

               Music continues. Agent Hadley is leaning against his car, his
               eyes open, a large bullet hole in his head.

               Music continues. Wayne is sitting on the couch, an open package
               on the coffee table. He smiles as he stares at the stacks of cash
               the crew took from Zammito.

               Jerry Vale continues singing as the plane glides through a clear
               blue sky. Music fades.

               

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

               

               EXT. BASTALDI'S'S WAREHOUSE -- PARIS -- MORNING

               Bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air.    He takes a few
               steps, then stops.

               BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,
               Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,
               tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they
               stare at Bastaldi.

               A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.   When it passes
               the crew it gone!

               Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.    Bastaldi looks around, but there
               is no sign of them.

               

               A DIFFERENT ANGLE
               We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel
               peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure
               out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's
               bewilderment.

                                       RAYMOND
                          What's he doing?

               

                                                                        105.

               

                                       MARCEL
                          He's looking around for us.

                                       ZERO
                          Zero can't stay like this much longer.
                          His leg is hurting.

               Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment.

               

               INT. BASTALDI'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               Bastaldi is at his desk, nervously tapping his fingers on the
               surface. The phone rings. He knows who is calling. He stares at
               the phone for a long moment, then he slowly lifts the receiver.

                                       BASTALDI
                          Hello?

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          It's Daniel.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (in French)
                          Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has
                          been a big--

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (overlapping; in French)
                          -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want
                          to see your brother out of jail do exactly
                          what I say. Bring one million euros to
                          your boat at six o'clock.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (in French)
                          A million! I don't have that kind of
                          money.

                                        DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about
                          the Van Gogh.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (In French)
                          I don't have it. That's why Vincent
                          went to Chicago. They arrested him before
                          he could bring it back.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Well, you better get the money somehow.
                          Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't
                          we'll destroy the tapes.

               The line goes dead.

               

                                                                          106.

               

               EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi drives up.    He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously
               walks to the boat.

               

               INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi enters. No one appears to be there.    Bastaldi's cell
               phone rings. He answers it.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Go back on deck. There's a small rowboat
                          in the water --

               

               EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel, Sami and Zero watch the houseboat.   Daniel continues his
               conversation on the cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          Put the money in the rowboat and untie
                          it. The current will carry it down river.
                          When we see that the money is there I'll
                          call back and tell you where the tapes
                          are.

               DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in
               the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.

               

               EXT. DOWN RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel
               is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long
               pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside
               are several stacks of five hundred franc notes. Marcel looks to
               Raymond with a grin and nods. Raymond opens his cell phone.

               

               EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel, Sami and Zero continue to watch the houseboat.   Sami's
               cell phone rings. He answers it and listens.

                                       RAYMOND (V.O.)
                          We're in business.

               Sami nods to Daniel.

               

               EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi's cell phone rings.   He answers it.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Go down into the main cabin.   The tapes
                          are in the wooden chest.

               

                                                                        107.

               
               The line goes dead.

               

               INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi enters, looks around the room until he sees the wooden
               chest. He walks over and opens it. Inside there are several
               cassette tapes in the cardboard box.
               Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest. He
               hears a CLICK. He notices something is attached to the bottom of
               the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin
               on an electronic device.

               

               EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts
               flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.

                                       DANIEL
                          This is for Julien.

               He presses the button.

               

               INT. HOUSEBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

               A digital counter begins counting backwards. Bastaldi realizes
               that the device is a BOMB. He stares at the numbers quickly speed
               by 8... 7... 6... 5...

                                        BASTALDI
                          Oh, Merde!

               

               EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- FIVE SECONDS LATER

               The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of
               wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke
               swirls in the wind.

               

               EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering
               wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that
               justice has been done.

                                       SAMI
                          Did you have to use that much explosive?

                                       DANIEL
                          I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

               Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through
               the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is
               real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size
               as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.

                                       DANIEL
                          You didn't check it?

               

                                                                           108.

               

               EXT. BRIDGE -- AFTERNOON

               The five of them walk across the bridge.

                                       MARCEL
                          I'm sorry! I was caught up in the
                          excitement of the moment. I should have
                          checked. I made a mistake. I suppose
                          that none of you have ever made a mistake
                          before?

               No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and
               removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.

                                       SAMI
                          This is great. After everything we've
                          been through we've got eight hundred
                          euros and an autographed baseball.

                                       MARCEL
                          The baseball is mine.

                                       SAMI
                          No! You can't have the baseball! You're
                          not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!

               Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.

                                       MARCEL
                          I'm the one who took it.   It's my
                          baseball!

                                       ZERO
                          If you say baseball one more time Zero
                          will shoot you.

                                       MARCEL
                          Raymond, don't you think they're over
                          reacting a little?

                                       RAYMOND
                          No. I think they have a right to express
                          their anger with you in light of the
                          fact that you're...
                               (something in him
                                snaps)

                          A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK

                          THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!

               Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise.     Even Raymond is
               surprised by his outburst.

                                       MARCEL
                          Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be
                          angry... but I'm the one who took the
                          ball and that makes it mine.

                                          SAMI
                          No.

               

                                                                          109.

               

                                       MARCEL
                          Give it to me, Sami.

                                        SAMI
                          No!

               Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.
               Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard
               and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls
               off the bridge into the river.

                                        SAMI
                          Perfect.

               Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.
               Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.
               Something catches Daniel's attention.

               DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped
               away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
               canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns
               the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with
               twelve sunflowers".

               Daniel's jaw drops.   The others notice his stunned expression and
               follow his stare.

               THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting.
               They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward.
               They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.
               The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They
               reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,
               watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.

               

               EXT. BRIDGE -- WIDE SHOT -- AFTERNOON

               They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all
               jump off the bridge. As they fall towards the water we...

               

                                                                  FREEZE FRAME

               FADE IN:

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               A roulette table. The PUNTERS place their bets. TWELVE 
               PLAYERS, nine men, three women. The FACES of the men, all 
               ages, intense, hopeful, fearful. Which of them is JACK?

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Now he had become the still centre 
                         of that spinning wheel of 
                         misfortune.

               A MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against 
               the spin. Hands, faces, chips...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The world turned round him... 
                         leaving him miraculously untouched 
                         The little white ball circles the

                         The croupier had reached his goal. 
                         He no longer heard the sound of 
                         the ball.

               The back of the CROUPIER'S hand, his slicked-back short 
               hair, razor cut. The CAMERA moves around to his face...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         To begin with he was Jack Manfred...

               whistling sound takes Jack back in time.

               INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

               JACK is walking through a maze of open-plan partitioned 
               offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed 
               blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost 
               unrecognisable from the croupier's face.

               He searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on 
               the open is GILES CREMORNE.

               GILES CREMORNE, a public schoolboy in his late twenties 
               comes forward and vigorously shakes JACK'S hand. Jacketless, 
               he wears yellow braces. Next to his tidy desk is a slot 
               machine.

                         What's it been, two years since we 
                         broke bread?

               GILES has an upper-class accent, but an acquired street 
               manner.

                         We all played the field.

               GILES frowns at a memory, an implication. GILES'S mobile

                         I was thinking perhaps I could be 
                         a reader. You employ readers, don't 
                         you?

               GILES pops a coin into the slot machine, pulls the handle,

                         Interesting, Giles. I will think

                         my motto. Write, write, write.

               JACK nods, extends his hand. A firm handshake.

               The untidy evidence. To the accompaniment of the music, a 
               discordant version, three dog-eared copies of 'The Invention 
               Of The Wheel', A Novel by JACK MANFRED. Worn furniture. A 
               pile of literary magazines. Two elegantly arranged vases 
               of flowers.  Women's fashion magazines. Books everywhere, 
               including 'Scarne on Gambling', 'The Education of A Poker 
               Player', 'Delta of Venus' and other books by Anais Nin. A 
               woman's dress, back from the cleaners. A framed etching of 
               Cape Town, South Africa, in the eighteenth century. 
               Finally...

               Beneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron 
               steps down from the street, JACK sits at the dining table. 
               In front of him is a word processor. He toys with a glass 
               of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer 
               fan magazine. He starts to touch-type, looking at the 
               screen, not the keyboard. Words appear, letter by letter... 
               THE BALL... A NOVEL... BY JACK MANFRED. He pauses to drink.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

               A MAN, face unseen, steps into a phone booth. CLOSE ON: 
               his hands.  It is impossible to tell where he is.

               He opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc., and 
               searches through for something. 

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

               He finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among 
               others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform. 
               On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed 
               out. The MAN lifts the receiver, inserts coins. He starts 
               to press the numbers. There are CLOSE-UPS of his finger 
               pressing the sequence of digits, each one CLOSER, longer 
               than the one before, until...

               INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

               The phone rings. JACK looks to the answering machine, waits

                         In London, I mean. I've been 
                         chatting to some friends. Do you 
                         know the Golden Lion casino? It's 
                         in Bayswater, I believe... They're 
                         looking for a dealer, a croupier.

               JACK SR pulls out a cigarette - a Gitanes.

                                     JACK
                         That's not what I want to do, dad.

               JACK stubs his cigarette out.

                         you don't like taking my advice...

                         personally, but I've spoken to his 
                         boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give 
                         yourself a break.

               JACK reaches for a cigarette.

                         All right, I'll think about it.

                 I won't. Goodbye, dad.

                         Just do it. You've got the knack, 
                         you've got the personality, you

                         look a gift horse in the mouth. 
                         Have you written that name down?

               JACK is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down 
               on a pad.

                                     JACK

               now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks 
               to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's 
               jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit 
               is waiting.

                                     JACK SR.
                              (smiles)
                         Sorry to keep you. What'll you 
                         have?

               INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

               JACK, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. He 
               looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY... 
               JACK MANFRED.'

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack knew something was wrong. 
                         He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles 
                         said three words.

               JACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE 
               BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still 
                         wasn't quite right...

               He types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN 
               THE'.  Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the 
               street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls 
               in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud.

                                     DRUNK'S VOICE
                         I want to fuck the whole world 
                         over.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               Reception area. The CAMERA turns around the fake glitz of 
               the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and 
               moves towards the front door.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Welcome back Jack... to the house 
                         of addiction.

               The door opens. Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S 
               silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him. 
               JACK removes his wristwatch.

               INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

               JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his 
               late forties, dead behind the eyes.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         David Reynolds, I'm the Manager 
                         here. Sit down, John.

                                     JACK
                         Jack.

               REYNOLDS examines a file in front of him.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         You've been recommended by the 
                         management here. They know your 
                         father. He has a bit of a 
                         reputation, hasn't he?

                                     JACK
                              (frowns)
                         Has he?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         In any case, I understand you've 
                         had some previous experience... in 
                         South Africa.
                              (Jack nods)
                         You'll find the rules a little 
                         different here. Before we start, 
                         you haven't got a police record, 
                         have you?

                                     JACK
                         No.

               REYNOLDS opens the door. He lets JACK go on ahead.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Where did you go to school?

                                     JACK
                              (surpised)
                         I was at Beadles.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         I don't think I know that one.  
                         Private, I suppose.

               INT. CASINO - HALL - DAY

               The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky 
               appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has 
               roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted 
               except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying 
               ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         There are three types of casino in 
                         the U.K. High volume. Small faction. 
                         And MOTR. That's middle of the 
                         road. Us.

                                     JACK
                         Do you have a Salon Prive?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         We tried. But there wasn't enough 
                         business. The punters like company.

               REYNOLDS goes to one of the tables with JACK.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Let's see you handle the chips.

               He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying 
               denominations onto the table.

                                     JACK
                         I have to assume the serial numbers 
                         on the bowl and cylinder correspond.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         We check every four days.

                                     JACK
                         Why four? And not three or five?

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (shrugs)
                         It's the procedure here. Now sort 
                         the chips.

               JACK starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred 
               pounds to five. REYNOLDS watches. JACK'S fingers work fast. 
               In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked.

                                     JACK
                         Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Any exceptions?

                                     JACK
                         25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Give me 365.

               He presses a stopwatch in his hand. JACK quickly sets out 
               four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65. All four piles 
               are in denominations of ten and five.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Very good. Now take these colours...

               He throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table.  
               The blue are 10, the white are 5.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         I want 780, but I want 500 in 
                         denominations of 25.

               JACK nods and gets to work. His fingers make Reynolds's 
               ticking watch seem slow.

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (impressed)
                         Very good.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               Now at a roulette table, REYNOLDS has prepared the bets 
               for fifteen punters. It's a set-up to test Jack's style 
               and concentration. REYNOLDS gives JACK the white ball.

                                     JACK
                         You use two alternating, don't 
                         you?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         We do.
                              (hands him a second 
                              ball)

                                     JACK
                              (hesitates)
                         Where's the magnet?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         They've been tested.

               JACK spins the wheel, throws the ball against the turn.

                                     JACK
                         No more bets.

               As the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, REYNOLDS 
               turns to a CLEANING LADY who's emptying some ashtrays 
               nearby.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Could you stop that for a minute?

               The WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches 
               sight of REYNOLDS surreptitiously moving a chip onto the 
               third line.

                                     JACK
                         I'm sorry, sir, I've called no 
                         more bets.

               JACK reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the 
               wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The 
               ball stops.

                                     JACK
                         23 Red. Odd.

               He now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the 
               smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23. 
               It's all very efficient and speedy.

               REYNOLDS is increasingly impressed.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Haven't you forgotten something?

                                     JACK
                              (thinks)
                         I don't think so.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Wipe your hands.

               JACK takes out a handkerchief.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Not with your own cloth. Besides, 
                         your pockets will be stitched.

                                     JACK
                         What happens if I want to sneeze?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         You won't. Not without permission.

               JACK laughs. REYNOLDS smiles. They like each other.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Fine. Now let's move on.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               A blackjack table. JACK is turning cards over for five 
               punters in an arc. REYNOLDS is moving from one chair to 
               the next playing each of the five hands.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         How many aces are left?

                                     JACK
                         Five.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         I make it six.

                                     JACK
                         Five.

               REYNOLDS looks down at the table.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         What makes you so sure?

                                     JACK
                         It's a rule. Always stand by your 
                         first count. The odds are you're 
                         right.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Good call.

               JACK pulls out the shoe.

                                     JACK
                         You want me to check?

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (irritably)
                         I said good call.

               REYNOLDS walks away. JACK puts the shoe back. He takes his 
               watch out of his pocket, glances at it.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         It had taken him 45 minutes, but 
                         Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number. 
                         The man couldn't count.

               INT. CASINO - OFFICE - DAY

               Back in the office REYNOLDS is talking to JACK. On 
               REYNOLDS'S desk is a framed photograph of his suburban 
               wife and two kids.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Let me just run through a few 
                         things. As a dealer you never 
                         gamble, not anywhere. We'll need 
                         your picture.

                                     JACK
                         What for?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         For the database. It can be accessed 
                         by every casino in the country. We 
                         have the same system for punters.

                                     JACK
                         I don't gamble.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Ever?

                                     JACK
                         I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

               REYNOLDS doesn't pursue it.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Next point. Friendships between 
                         croupiers inside or outside the 
                         casino are discouraged. 
                         Relationships with females working 
                         here are expressly forbidden.

                                     JACK
                         We had the same rule at Sun City, 
                         but it was impossible to check.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         This isn't South Africa. We'd know, 
                         because someone would report it. 
                         Believe me, someone always does.

                                     JACK
                         Does know? Or does report? What 
                         would happen if I knew something 
                         like that and didn't report it?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         We'd know. There are no secrets in 
                         this casino. You'd be punished.

                                     JACK
                         How?

                                     REYNOLDS
                         First offence: verbal warning. 
                         Second offence: written warning.  
                         That one's filed and sometimes 
                         copied to the Gaming Board. My 
                         discretion. Third offence: you're 
                         sacked on the spot. You'd never 
                         work in a casino in this country 
                         again.  There's another rule: you're 
                         forbidden to talk to or recognise 
                         a punter outside the casino. If 
                         you see someone who's gambled here, 
                         even if it's just casually on the 
                         street, you must ignore him. Or 
                         her. You're not married, are you?

               JACK shakes his head

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Girlfriend?

                                     JACK
                         Yes.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         She's not in the gaming business 
                         is she?

                                     JACK
                         No.

               INT. CASINO - "CROW'S NEST" - DAY

               A CCTV Centre over the casino. JACK crosses the room, 
               looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino 
               below. REYNOLDS walks over to a series of twenty or more 
               banked TV monitors with many Video 8 tape decks.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing 
                         it to you now, but you'll never 
                         see it again.

                                     JACK
                         Very impressive.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         We have tapes in here that go back 
                         six months. Let me show you 
                         something.

               REYNOLDS presses a button. Together they look at a TV 
               monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where 
               a WOMAN is cheating. REYNOLDS freezes the frame.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         See that?  That was six weeks ago. 
                         The dealer missed it. The guy up 
                         here missed it, but I watch these 
                         tapes after hours. Nothing gets by 
                         me. Now the lady's in jail. It's 
                         easier to take ten million pounds 
                         from a bank than take one penny 
                         from this casino.

               INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

               Again in the office. REYNOLDS extends his hand. JACK shakes 
               it.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         You can start Monday week.

                                     JACK
                         Fine.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         That hair will have to go.

                                     JACK
                         Fine.

               Pause.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Are you planning to make a career 
                         in casino work?

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         And end up like you?

                                     JACK
                         I just want the job.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Jack, you're not the usual type we 
                         get here.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Mr Reynolds was right. It was true. 
                         Jack was up above the world. An 
                         artist, living in the clouds. 
                         Looking down.

               A HIGH ANGLED SHOT of the office, JACK and REYNOLDS. The 
               phone rings.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Excuse me...

               REYNOLDS picks up and listens. The CAMERA descends.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         I can't talk about this now... no, 
                         I'm with somebody. They can wait!  
                         I'll be home at the usual time... 
                         all right, I'll call you back in 
                         an hour...
                              (hangs up)
                         Don't ever get married, Jack. Casino 
                         work doesn't mix with house and 
                         garden. Any questions?

               The CAMERA reaches a LOW ANGLE on JACK, looking up.

                                     JACK
                         Yes. What's the salary?

               EXT. CAR - STREETS - TWILIGHT

               The street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a 
               Sixties Austin-Healey.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The casino paid its staff monthly 
                         in arrears. He would have to wait 
                         six weeks for his first cheque. He 
                         needed money now.

               EXT. USED CAR LOT - TWILIGHT

               Under a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking 
               round jack's car, examining it.

                                     DEALER
                              (fake American accent)
                         What kind of deal you looking to?

                                     JACK
                         What's the Blue Book price?

                                     DEALER
                         That's not relevant. An old car 
                         like this, it depends on the 
                         condition.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The car was a gift from Jack's 
                         father. That's to say, Jack Senior 
                         had given it to him before the 
                         bailiffs arrived.

               The DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the 
               protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust.

                                     DEALER
                         This ain't exactly what you'd call 
                         mint.

               He bends down and looks underneath the car.

                                     JACK
                         How about fifteen hundred?

                                     DEALER
                         How about five hundred.

                                     JACK
                         What?!

                                     DEALER
                         How about we split the diff... 
                         Seven-fifty.

                                     JACK
                         Is that your idea of arithmetic?

                                     DEALER
                         I'm not a mathematician. I'm in 
                         business.

                                     JACK
                         Eight-fifty.

                                     DEALER
                         Seven-fifty.

               The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one 
               is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He suddenly wanted to be rid of 
                         it. 'Hang on tightly, let go 
                         lightly'. It was a saying Jack 
                         remembered.

               JACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and 
               cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins...

               INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

               ... And continues. JACK stands, with an unlit cigarette, 
               in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and 
               WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES: 
               Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, 
               Self-Help, Cooking....

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack imagined people reading his 
                         book. One day he would enter their 
                         heads, play with their imaginations, 
                         test their feelings...

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               JACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where 
               Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are 
               scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He would tell them you have to 
                         make a choice in life. Be a gambler 
                         or a croupier. And then live with 
                         your decision come what may.

               He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind 
               him.

               INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT

               JACK unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of 
               street sounds and a dog barking.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Marion saw life differently. She 
                         was a romantic. And thought he was 
                         too.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               Radio music is playing from another room. An orchestral 
               version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs 
               his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase 
               of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK sees on the bed, an open box and a carrier bag from a 
               designer department store. Among the white tissue paper is 
               a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black 
               underwear. He smiles and picks up the knickers. He goes to 
               the open bathroom door, from which comes the music.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               A radio plays beside the bath. The water is draining away.

               MARION NEIL, a red-haired woman in her mid-thirties, wearing 
               a bathrobe with the name MARION on it is examining the 
               lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. She 
               sees JACK, turns with a smile. JACK holds up the black 
               knickers.

                                     MARION
                         I couldn't resist them.

                                     JACK
                         You mean I won't resist them.

               JACK goes to her.

                                     MARION
                         No, no. I'm not ready for you. 
                         There's some vodka in the freezer.

                                     JACK
                         You want me drunk?

                                     MARION
                              (laughs)
                         I won't be that long.

               She pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards 
               the door.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK comes back into the bedroom. MARION pushes the bathroom 
               door, not quite closed. JACK tosses the knickers onto the 
               bed.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               JACK takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer, pours 
               himself a glass. He sees two bottles of wine opened, food 
               neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book. He pours 
               a glass of wine.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK sits drinking his vodka. Looking up through the barred 
               window he sees women's legs passing on the street above. 
               On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine.

               MARION materialises in the door to the bedroom. She is 
               made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black 
               shoes, a black scarf around her neck.

               JACK takes the glass of wine and gives it to her.

                                     JACK
                         You really are a beautiful woman.

                                     MARION
                              (pleased)
                         It's not just inner beauty, is it?

                                     JACK
                         Turn around.

               MARION whirls to show off her dress.

                                     JACK
                         You're all I desire.

               He reaches for an envelope on the desk. He gives it to 
               her. MARION opens it. There are several fifty pound notes 
               inside.

                                     MARION
                         Where did you get it?

                                     JACK
                         I. sold the car.

                                     MARION
                         You shouldn't have done that. I 
                         know what it meant to you.

                                     JACK
                         I owe you for the rent. It's only 
                         a car. I can get another.

                                     MARION
                         Take it back. Till you sell your 
                         book.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, Marion. Let's face the 
                         truth. Nobody's going to publish 
                         it.

                                     MARION
                         Of course they will. You just have 
                         to be patient. I'm betting on you.

               She raises the glass of wine, drinks.

                                     JACK
                         I'm not much of a bet.

               He drains his glass.

                                     MARION
                         You are to me.

               She takes her scarf, puts it round his neck, pulls him 
               seductively towards the bedroom door.

                                     MARION
                         Come into my world.

               She winds the black scarf across his face, covering his 
               eyes.

                                     MARION
                              (whispering)
                         You're my prisoner.

                                     JACK
                         I've got something to tell you.

                                     MARION
                         I want to hear it.

                                     JACK
                         I've got a job.

                                     MARION
                              (startled)
                         What job?

               MARION pulls the scarf from his eyes. She wants to look at 
               him.

                                     JACK
                         In a casino. As a croupier. A 
                         dealer.

                                     MARION
                         How did you land that?

                                     JACK
                         It came my way. 450 a week.

                                     MARION
                              (sits up)
                         450? What did you do, just walked 
                         in and said I want to be a croupier? 
                         Don't you need training?

                                     JACK
                         I had training. In the Republic.

                                     MARION
                         You were a croupier there? You 
                         never told me that. I thought you 
                         just knew some gamblers.

                                     JACK
                         I start Monday week.

               From the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm.

                                     MARION
                         450 a week. I've never earned that 
                         in my life. You're an enigma, you 
                         are. A fucking enigma.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Not an enigma, just a contradiction.

               MARION looks deeply into his eyes.

                                     MARION
                         You sold the car. You got a job. 
                         What's the third thing? Tell me.

                                     JACK
                         There's no third thing. Don't be 
                         superstitious.

                                     MARION
                         I love you Jack, you know that.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         And he half-loved Marion. And she 
                         knew that too.

               Outside, the car alarm stops. JACK takes MARION'S head in 
               his hands. She reaches for one of them, examines it.

                                     JACK
                         Are you trying to read my palm?

                                     MARION
                         You've got such beautiful hands.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The hands of a conjuror, a woman 
                         had told him once. Or a card sharp.

               Their hands interlock. She leads him into the bedroom.

               INT. NAIL STUDIO - DAY

               JACK'S hands are being worked on by a woman MANICURIST.

                                     MANICURIST
                         What line of work are you in?

                                     JACK
                         I'm an undertaker.

                                     MANICURIST
                         Really?

               The MANICURIST stops for a moment, looks at him with 
               curiosity.

               INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

               A BARBER is cutting JACK'S hair. He goes up JACK'S neck 
               with electric clippers. Jack's hair is now black.

                                     BARBER
                         Do you work round here?

                                     JACK
                         My office is in Shanghai.

                                     BARBER
                              (surprised)
                         What do you do?

                                     JACK
                         I'm an arms dealer.

               The BARBER stops for a moment, nonplussed.

               INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - DAY

               In front of the mirror JACK buttons a white shirt and 
               skillfully ties a black bow tie. His short hair is lacquered 
               back. He reaches down for his black jacket... puts it on. 
               The transformation is complete.

               As he scrubs his nails, JACK sees a WOMAN in the mirror. 
               She is changing her clothes. She pulls off her Indian cotton 
               dress. She's wearing pants but no bra. Quite 
               unselfconsciously, not looking Jack's way, she dresses in 
               her casino clothes.

               JACK dries his hands. He turns. The WOMAN smiles at him.

                                     BELLA
                         I'm Bella.

                                     JACK
                         Jack Manfred.

                                     BELLA
                         Hi, Jack.
                              (fits herself into 
                              the uplift bra)
                         Welcome to the cesspit.

                                     JACK
                         Is it that bad?

                                     BELLA
                              (starts to do up 
                              her top)
                         How do I look?

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Like trouble, Bella. You look fine.

                                     BELLA
                         The punters love it. Tits in 
                         uniform.

               She laughs.

               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

               JACK appears at the head of the table. The PUNTERS look at 
               him, not recognising him.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The usual bunch. They didn't know 
                         Jack, but he knew them.

                                     JACK
                         Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

               A fat INDIAN PUNTER addresses JACK.

                                     INDIAN
                         Where's the other fellow? Where's 
                         Geoff?

                                     JACK
                         He doesn't work here any more.

                                     INDIAN
                         Well, let's hope you know your 
                         job.

               A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN trying to look as young as possible 
               throws 100 pounds in cash to JACK.

                                     WOMAN
                         Tens, please.

               She turns to the WOMAN next to her, who looks very similar.

                                     WOMAN 2
                         Perhaps this man will bring us 
                         luck.

               The WOMAN has sensed her friend's interest in JACK. She's 
               jealous.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Jack)
                         What's that aftershave you're 
                         wearing?

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Never converse with the punters. 
                         It slows things down. Speed is 
                         volume, and volume is profit for 
                         the casino. Aim at twenty spins an 
                         hour.

               JACK pretends he hasn't heard the question. In the 
               background REYNOLDS is watching as JACK spins the wheel.

                                     JACK
                         Last bets, please.

               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

               Later. A plastic-looking BLONDE WOMAN, heavily made-up, 
               sits at the table. She nods to JACK. PUNTERS are placing 
               their bets. She has 50 casino chips of £100 denominations 
               in front of her. JACK notes the large sum.

               The BLONDE puts £2,500 on red and £2,500 on black. PUNTERS 
               round the table are astonished at the size of the bet and 
               the strangeness of betting both red and black.

               JACK spins the wheel. Black 10 comes up. JACK takes the 
               red loss and moves it across the table to the black win. 
               The BLONDE picks up the £5,000 without a reaction and leaves 
               the table.

               JACK notices that she goes straight to the cashier's desk. 
               JACK clears the chips away, starts to pay out.

               A WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him:

                                     MAN
                         You're new here. You'll get used 
                         to Madame Claude. She comes in 
                         once or twice a week and does that.

               JACK nods.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He knew the scam. Come in with 
                         five grand cash. No questions asked. 
                         Launder it by getting a casino 
                         cheque when you cash in. Jack 
                         wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted 
                         it? After all there's was no profit 
                         in it for the casino. Or was there?

               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

               Later. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK 
               MAN sits at the table. He doesn't attempt to bet. He looks 
               around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace 
               JACK at the wheel. This is MATT. He gives JACK a curious 
               complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out.

                                     JACK
                         Thank you very much, ladies and 
                         gentlemen. I'm going to hand you 
                         over now to my colleague. Goodnight.

               MATT takes over.

                                     MATT
                         Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

               REYNOLDS appears and takes JACK'S arm.

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (quietly)
                         Good work, Jack. You handled 
                         yourself well.

               At the table, MATT glances at the GREEK man.

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

               JACK is now dealing to FIVE PUNTERS. He has a 10 and a 5 
               exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER 
               sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card 
               for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists 
               again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan. 
               The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One 
               of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all 
               his chips, and leaves.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Suddenly a delayed wave of elation 
                         came over him.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               Across the casino an Oriental man, MR TCHAI, is walking 
               towards the table with REYNOLDS. Behind him is a 6 foot 5 
               bulging BODYGUARD. REYNOLDS comes up to JACK's table.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Why don't you take a break, Jack.

                                     JACK
                              (puzzled)
                         All right, Mr Reynolds.

               He moves his chair back, nods at the remaining PLAYERS. MR 
               TCHAI sits down, watched by the BODYGUARD.

               BELLA comes up, smiles sweetly, and takes over from JACK.

                                     BELLA
                         Good evening, Mr Tchai.

                                     MR TCHAI
                         Good evening.

               TCHAI pulls out a sealed bank packet of £5,000.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.

               REYNOLDS waves to a WAITRESS who comes over.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (to Mr Tchai)
                         Your usual, sir?

               TCHAI nods. He hands her a £50 note.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         £50 for a diet Coke. Waitresses 
                         were the true winners in the casino. 
                         They were the only members of staff 
                         allowed to accept tips. On a good 
                         night they could get between £200 
                         and £300.

               The WAITRESS goes. The other PLAYERS at the table look at 
               MR TCHAI, wondering who he is.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               REYNOLDS walks with JACK across the casino.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Mr Tchai always likes to play at 
                         that table, and only with Bella.

                                     JACK
                         Does he win?

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (smiles)
                         He's a good customer.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         A good customer is a consistent 
                         loser. Was that what Mr Reynolds 
                         meant?

               INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK is changing into his street clothes. The young croupier 
               MATT comes up to him.

                                     MATT
                         Where do you live, Jack?

                                     JACK
                         Over the river.

                                     MATT
                         Have you got transport?

               JACK shakes his head.

                                     MATT
                         I'm going over the river. I'll 
                         give you a lift if you like.

                                     JACK
                         Thanks.

               INT. BMW - NIGHT

               MATT puts the car into gear, drives off, JACK sitting beside 
               him.

                                     MATT
                         So how do you feel, your first 
                         night? I'll bet you're on a high.

                                     JACK
                         Nice car.

                                     MATT
                         She's my baby.

                                     JACK
                         How long have you worked at the 
                         casino?

                                     MATT
                         Coming up to two years now.
                              (mysteriously)
                         But I was away for six months.

                                     JACK
                         You've done pretty well.

                                     MATT
                              (smugly)
                         Not bad. I have other interests, 
                         of course.

               MATT spins the car round a corner.

                                     MATT
                         I'm off to a little watering hole. 
                         Why don't you join me? Relax.

                                     JACK
                         No thanks, Matt. I need my eight 
                         hours.

                                     MATT
                         I'll lay you five to one you won't 
                         sleep. In this job you have to 
                         unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. 
                         I mean that.

                                     JACK
                         Some other time.

               INT. FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               JACK pours himself a vodka, smoking a cigarette.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK starts to take his clothes off. MARION is asleep in 
               bed. She wakes.

                                     MARION
                         What's the time?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know.

               Clock beside the bed reads 4.30.

                                     MARION
                         How did it go?

                                     JACK
                         Fine.

               He gets into bed beside her. She takes him in her arms.

                                     MARION
                         You're shaking. What is it?

                                     JACK
                         Tension. It'll go.

                                     MARION
                         Poor baby.  This'll relax you.

               She starts to massage his neck, his hair.

                                     MARION
                         I loved it blond.

                                     JACK
                         It's only hair. I haven't changed.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               MARION is dressed in a suit, preparing to leave. She throws 
               her nightgown into a laundry basket. JACK is asleep. She 
               bends to kiss him. He wakes.

                                     MARION
                         When you get home, I'm asleep. 
                         When I leave home, you're asleep.

                                     JACK
                              (dreamily)
                         I'll see you in my dreams.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY

               MARION drops a set of keys into her bag, glances at JACK'S 
               covered computer. She draws the curtain back. Daylight 
               illuminates the old etching of Cape Town.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               JANI DE VILLIERS is 30-something, blonde, tanned, 
               expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK 
               ten £50 notes.

                                     JANI
                         In 20s, please...

               He slots the cash into the "bank" beneath the table, then 
               counts out £500 in £20 chips. He slides the chips towards 
               her, looks at her. She smiles.

               There are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC-
               LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down 
               the front of her dress.

                                     JACK
                              (frowns)
                         Place your bets.

               Around the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, 
               lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls 
               the numbers:

                                     JANI
                         5...8...11. 

               JACK places them for her.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack could see this woman was an 
                         experienced gambler. Professionals 
                         always place their bets through 
                         the croupier. That way there are 
                         no comebacks.

               The wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number 
               and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays 
               out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN 
               behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him. 
               She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel 
               again. 33 comes up.

               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

               JANI bets again on number 11. The MAN follows suit. The 
               wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him. 
               The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI. 
               Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round 
               and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip 
               to the square. JACK clocks it.

                                     JACK
                         I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.

                                     MAN
                              (in Arabic accent)
                         What are you talking about? It's 
                         11, I've won. With this lady.

                                     JACK
                              (carefully)
                         You've won with the two chips you 
                         placed earlier, but the third chip 
                         was a late bet.

                                     MAN
                         I put them on together.

                                     JACK
                         I'm afraid that's not so, sir.

               REYNOLDS, who has been watching the tables, sees the 
               beginning of an incident. He comes over. The MAN is getting 
               angry. JANI watches.

                                     MAN
                         Now look here, you...

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Is there a problem, sir?

                                     MAN
                         Yes. This croupier is accusing me 
                         of cheating.

                                     JACK
                         It was a late bet. This gentleman 
                         has been following the lady's 
                         numbers and...

               The MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm.

                                     MAN
                              (to Jani)
                         Do you think I cheated?

               JACK and REYNOLDS wait. JACK glances at JANI.

                                     JANI
                         In my opinion... it was a late 
                         bet.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         I think we should talk about this, 
                         sir. Away from the table.

                                     MAN
                              (angrily)
                         No. I won. I want to be paid.

               He bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S 
               decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Pay the gentleman. In full.

               REYNOLDS steps back, JACK pays out JANI and the MAN. The 
               MAN takes his winnings. He looks at JACK with hatred, then 
               leaves the table.

               REYNOLDS watches him, looks to JACK and nods. JANI collects 
               her winnings and throws two chips to JACK. She stands up 
               to leave.

                                     JACK
                         I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept 
                         gratuities in the UK. It's different 
                         in South Africa.

                                     JANI
                              (surprised)
                         You know where I'm from?

               JACK nods and gives her back the two chips.

                                     JACK
                         I've lived there.

                                     JANI
                              (sweetly)
                         Well, thank you anyway.

               JACK watches her leave.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Bright woman, he thought. She knew 
                         the rule of gold. Quit when you're 
                         ahead.

               JANI heads towards the cashier. JACK sees REYNOLDS arguing 
               with the irate ARABIC MAN near the entrance.

               He looks back to the table.

                                     JACK
                         Place your bets.

               On his way out the ARABIC MAN looks towards JACK and makes 
               an occult sign with his hand.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               It is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK 
               tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks 
               across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table 
               the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a 
               number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S 
               winnings, quickly and efficiently.

               JACK stiffens. He sees that something is wrong. MATT moves 
               piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up. 
               JACK glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras 
               and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has 
               seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his 
               winnings and leave.

               INT. BMW - NIGHT

               Again MATT is driving JACK home.

                                     JACK
                              (hesitantly)
                         Look Matt, there's something I 
                         have to say to you. I saw you 
                         cheating.

                                     MATT
                              (violently)
                         What the fuck are you talking about?

                                     JACK
                         That Greek guy who won at the end. 
                         You paid him out in 25s not 20s.

                                     MATT
                              (angry)
                         I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it 
                         wrong.

                                     JACK
                         I'm not going to report it.

               MATT slams on the brakes. The car comes to an abrupt stop. 
               MATT turns to JACK, furious.

                                     MATT
                         What are you, a cop?

                                     JACK
                         If I see you do it again, I'll 
                         report it.

                                     MATT
                         I don't get you. Even if it was 
                         true, which it isn't, what the 
                         fuck difference would it make to 
                         you?

                                     JACK
                         Because if a supervisor knew I'd 
                         seen you and I hadn't reported it, 
                         I'd lose my job as well. And I 
                         can't afford that.

                                     MATT
                         So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, 
                         this whole business is bent. The 
                         casino is nothing but legal theft. 
                         And that's OK. It's the system. 
                         Half the punters who come in are 
                         using stolen money, drug money, 
                         they haven't earned it. We earn 
                         our money.
                              (softens)
                         I'm on your side, Jack. I don't 
                         need an enemy.

                                     JACK
                         You're talking about complicity.

                                     MATT
                         I don't know what that means. I'm 
                         talking about not rocking the boat.

               MATT holds out his hand for JACK. JACK shakes it. MATT 
               grins.

                                     MATT
                         OK, now let's unwind.

               He puts the car into gear and drives off.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Matt was an escape artist. Like 
                         Jack's father.

               EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the 
               restaurant.  He and JACK get out of the car and go through 
               the open kitchen door.

               INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               The kitchen is full of people, some involved in cooking, 
               some standing around smoking and drinking, mostly Greek.

                                     MATT
                         Hey, Andros!

               He shakes hands with a GUY who looks like the owner.

                                     MATT
                         This is Jack.

               JACK shakes hands too. They cross the kitchen and go through 
               a bead curtain. Piped Greek music is playing.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               A smoke-filled private dining room. There is a poker game 
               in Progress. FIVE MEN are playing, a DOZEN GIRLS are dotted 
               about watching. There is a trestle table laden with Greek 
               food, from stews to salad, buffet-style. An improvised bar 
               with ouzo, vodka and wine. It's help-yourself.

                                     JACK
                         Who are these guys?

                                     MATT
                         Mostly people in the casino 
                         business. A few drug dealers.

                                     JACK
                         And the girls?

                                     MATT
                         Just girls. What are you drinking?

                                     JACK
                         Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

                                     MATT
                         Good call. Help yourself.

               JACK pours himself a vodka, scoops up some ice with his 
               hand from a bucket. Clouds of smoke envelop him. The noise 
               is close to deafening.

                                     JACK
                         Does Bella come here?

                                     MATT
                         That bitch? No.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               The poker game. A MAN with fair hair gets up, kisses a 
               GIRL whose dress is a bathing suit, puts his arm round her 
               and they wander off. MATT is at the table. JACK is 
               replenishing his vodka.

                                     MATT
                         Hey Jack, join us.

                                     JACK
                         No thanks.

                                     MATT
                              (laughs)
                         Don't worry, I won't report you!

                                     JACK
                         I don't gamble.

               GIRL appears behind JACK's shoulder.

                                     GIRL
                         You don't gamble, but do you smoke?

               The GIRL has a joint in her over-ringed hand. She is dressed 
               in purple Indian cotton.

                                     JACK
                         Sometimes.

                                     GIRL
                              (hands him the 
                              smoking joint)
                         How about now?

               She blows smoke in his face. JACK drains his vodka, pours 
               himself another.

               INT. RESTAURANT - LAVATORY - NIGHT

               JACK comes into the Gents, another smoke-filled room. Three 
               or four MEN are arguing over a drug deal, standing in front 
               of the urinal. One of them has an envelope full of cash, 
               another a packet of drugs.

               JACK goes to a lavatory stall, opens the door. In the stall 
               the fair-haired MAN who was at Matt's table is sitting on 
               the lavatory, his trousers round his ankles. The GIRL in 
               the bathing suit is sitting on his thighs, bobbing up and 
               down. JACK sees a butterfly tattoo on her left cheek, the 
               Queen of Spades.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Marion. I'm on my way...

               INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK puts his arm on MATT's shoulder at the poker table.

                                     JACK
                         I'm off. I need to sleep.

                                     MATT
                         Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, 
                         this job'll get to you. The 
                         pressure's too much, believe me, 
                         it'll break you.

                                     JACK
                         "The world breaks everyone, and 
                         afterwards many are strong in the 
                         broken places." Ernest Hemingway.

               JACK turns and leaves, helping himself to another drink.

                                     MATT
                         Wasn't he the one who shot himself?

               INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK comes to the flat. He is drunk. He starts across the 
               dark room. Suddenly the light comes on. JACK turns to see 
               MARION, sitting in a chair in her night-dress.

                                     MARION
                         Where've you been? I've got to 
                         give evidence in court at nine.

                                     JACK
                         Don't play the cop with me, Marion.

                                     MARION
                         Take that back!
                              (furious)
                         Fucking take that back. I'm not a 
                         cop any more.

                                     JACK
                         I take it back. You're not a cop 
                         any more. You're a store detective.

                                     MARION
                         Are you drunk?

                                     JACK
                         Probably.

                                     MARION
                         This fucking job's getting to you. 
                         You haven't written a fucking word 
                         since you started.

                                     JACK
                         Do you have to swear all the time?

                                     MARION
                              (hurt)
                         Well, that's my poor upbringing. I 
                         didn't go to no private school. I 
                         haven't got no class. I want to 
                         live with a writer. Not a fucking 
                         croupier. I don't even know what 
                         the word means. Croupier.

                                     JACK
                         Marion, stop this.

                                     MARION
                              (near to tears)
                         What do I mean to you? I want to 
                         know. Tell me.

               There is a pause.

                                     JACK
                         You're my conscience.

                                     MARION
                         Haven't you got a conscience of 
                         your own?

               JACK has no answer. He goes into the bathroom.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

               The computer is still covered. JACK is standing at the 
               table dealing cards, practising. One card slips. He swears 
               silently. He flexes his fingers, cracks his knuckle joints. 
               He looks at a skirt, legs, high heels, Passing above the 
               barred window.

               EXT. PICCADILLY - EVENING

               JACK emerges from the Underground, one of the CROWD.

               EXT. PICCADILLY - STORE - EVENING

               JACK goes into a large Department Store.

               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

               MARION is store-walking in the women's underwear department. 
               It is Sale time. Baskets of tights and knickers on display. 
               CUSTOMERS are rummaging. She is on the look-out for thieves. 
               She jumps as JACK places his hand on her hip.

                                     MARION
                         What are you doing here?
                              (looks round 
                              nervously)
                         You know the rules.

                                     JACK
                         What about a drink on the way home?

                                     MARION
                         I don't finish till eight. Make it 
                         nine and you're on.

                                     JACK
                         I'm on at nine.

                                     MARION
                         Well, that's our life now, isn't 
                         it?

               EXT. PICCADILLY - EVENING

               JACK pauses in front of an airline office. There is a large 
               picture of Cape Town, and a special ticket offer.

               JANI comes out of the office. Her hair, tied back earlier 
               in the casino, is now glamorously fluffed out. She sees 
               JACK. He doesn't see her.

                                     JANI
                         Thinking of going back?                                         

               JACK is startled. He doesn't recognise her for a moment. 
               Then...

                                     JACK
                         Oh hello.

                                     JANI
                              (smiling)
                         You know what? I'd like to buy you 
                         a drink.

                                     JACK
                         It's against the rules. Dealers 
                         are forbidden to talk to punters.

                                     JANI
                         That's stupid. What are the odds 
                         of you being seen with me?

                                     JACK
                         Impossible to calculate.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack knew that, in reality, all 
                         odds are calculable.

               INT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT

               The Art Deco bar. Expensive PEOPLE around. JANI and JACK 
               are installed on a sofa. A WAITER puts down two Martinis.

                                     JANI
                              (raises her glass)
                         To coincidence.

                                     JACK
                              (drinks)
                         There's a casino in this hotel.

                                     JANI
                         I'm not much of a gambler really. 
                         I just like this bar.

                                     JACK
                         So why did you come to my casino?

                                     JANI
                         I was at a loose end. A friend of 
                         a friend gave me a courtesy 
                         membership.

                                     JACK
                         First visit to London?

                                     JANI
                         No, no. I come every couple of 
                         years. I always think I'm going to 
                         stay. I'm from Cape Town originally

                                     JACK
                         I was born in the Transkei, on the 
                         Wild Coast.

                                     JANI
                         Near the casino.

                                     JACK
                         In the casino.

                                     JANI
                         Now there's a coincidence. My father 
                         used to gamble there.

                                     JACK
                         Your father?

                                     JANI
                         I loved the atmosphere. But it 
                         destroyed my poor mother.

                                     JACK
                         The debts.

                                     JANI
                         And the lies. Gamblers are born 
                         liars.

                                     JACK
                              (nods)
                         And superstitious too. It's like 
                         witchcraft.

                                     JANI
                         That's Africa. There's an African 
                         in all of us, isn't there?

                                     JACK
                         We all came from Africa, supposedly.

                                     JANI
                         Do you believe in astrology?

                                     JACK
                         Absolutely not. But then, I'm a 
                         Gemini and Geminis don't believe 
                         in astrology.

               JANI laughs out loud.

                                     JANI
                         You know, you don't strike me as a 
                         typical croupier.

               JANI drinks. JACK notices her wedding ring. JANI catches 
               the look.

                                     JANI
                         I'm not married. I wear it to keep 
                         the flies off.
                              (looks at her watch)
                         I must go. Let me pay for this.

                                     JACK
                         Absolutely not.

                                     JANI
                         Toss you for it.

                                     JACK
                         I don't gamble.

               JANI nods, stands up, takes out a notepad and pen. She 
               looks round feigning conspiracy.

                                     JANI
                              (low voice)
                         I know this is verboten, but if 
                         you feel like a chat or maybe 
                         dinner, give me a call.

               She scribbles her name and phone number on the pad, tears 
               off the page, gives it to him.

                                     JANI
                         I'll understand if you don't.
                              (smiles)
                         But I hope you do.

               She leaves. JACK watches her go, looks at the page she's 
               given him.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               In front of a mirror JACK trims his hair with nail scissors. 
               He is dressed in his croupier's uniform. He straightens 
               his bow tie.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He didn't know why, but he'd started 
                         to dress for the casino at home...

               INT. UNDERGROUND COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               JACK sits in the compartment.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         ... like a musician in his tuxedo, 
                         going to the concert hall on public 
                         transport...

               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

               An ARAB at the end of the table kisses all his £50 chips 
               and sets them out on the table. The wheel spins. JACK looks 
               round at the PUNTERS.

               The ball bounces, falls on zero. Everybody loses. Many 
               groans.

               A MEDITERRANEAN-LOOKING MAN with a gold bracelet coughs. A 
               gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that 
               JACK is raking away. A WOMAN in her mid-thirties is 
               appalled.

                                     WOMAN
                         Animal!

                                     JACK
                         Would you mind being more careful, 
                         sir.

                                     MAN
                         I've got 'flu.

               He coughs again, but into a handkerchief.

                                     WOMAN
                         Then go back home. To the zoo!

               JACK clears the piles of chips to one side. He signals to 
               a SUPERVISOR. The SUPERVISOR hurries over.

                                     JACK
                         This gentleman accidentally coughed 
                         onto these chips. I don't think it 
                         would be hygienic to stack them...

               The SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over.

                                     SUPERVISOR
                         Agnes. These chips have to be 
                         counted and put into the steamer.

                                     AGNES
                         Yuck.

               She looks at JACK, grimaces, and takes the chips away.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               The last PUNTERS are leaving. The overhead lights come on. 
               A CROUPIER is wheeling away a trolley with thousands of 
               chips. TWO MEN are covering the tables with shrouds.

               INT. CASINO - STRONG ROOM - NIGHT

               REYNOLDS watches as JACK and MATT count the thousands of 
               pounds, putting them in piles. Behind them is a large open 
               safe.

                                     MATT
                         I can't give you a lift back 
                         tonight.

                                     JACK
                         Don't worry.

               REYNOLDS places the notes in steel boxes.

               EXT. CASINO - NIGHT

               JACK, comes out. BELLA hurries after him, following him 
               round the corner.

                                     BELLA
                              (calling)
                         Jack. Do you need a ride?

                                     JACK
                         No. Thanks.

                                     BELLA
                         My car's in the garage.

                                     JACK
                         Maybe another time.

                                     BELLA
                         I'll take you up on that.

                                     JACK
                              (pleasantly)
                         Goodnight.

               He straightens his hat and walks off. BELLA walks the other 
               way.

               EXT. STREET. NIGHT

               A MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see 
               him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S 
               way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught 
               cheating at the casino with JANI.

                                     MAN
                         You don't recognise me? You had me 
                         barred. You fucking little worm.

                                     JACK
                         Wait a minute. You got yourself 
                         barred.

                                     MAN
                         It was you, you shit.

               The MAN reaches forward and grabs JACK'S tie. He yanks it 
               with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S 
               chest.

               The MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN 
               leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin.

               The fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse 
               struggling onto the pavement.

               A car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees 
               the fight.

               JACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back. 
               JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet.

                                     JACK
                         Now I'm going to kill you.

               He boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car 
               and runs over to them.

                                     BELLA
                         Jack!

               The MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA 
               pulls JACK away.

                                     BELLA
                         Jack. Leave him! Come on!

               JACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is 
               frightened by JACK'S violence.

                                     BELLA
                         Let's go. We don't want the cops 
                         here.

               Before she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the 
               MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand. 
               BELLA is shocked.

                                     JACK
                              (coldly)
                         He won't cheat again.

               BELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in, 
               drives away.

               INT. BELLA'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Water is running in the basin. BELLA puts JACK'S jacket on 
               the lavatory seat. She starts to undo his tie. JACK wipes 
               his blood-stained nose with a wet flannel.

                                     BELLA
                         You're shaking.

                                     JACK
                         It's the tension.

               She undoes his shirt and takes it off. He winces. She washes 
               his torso, cleans him up.

               JACK looks at his shaking hands. BELLA takes him by the 
               hand, leads him into the bedroom.

               INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She sits him on the bed. The room is lit with coloured 
               lamps.

                                     BELLA
                         Excuse the mess.

               JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the 
               bed. She is startled.

                                     BELLA
                         Careful.

               JACK'S hands open her blouse. He reaches for her breast. 
               BELLA'S surprise becomes excitement. He kisses her hungrily, 
               his hands rummaging in her clothes. She reaches for a side 
               zip in her skirt.

                                     BELLA
                         Don't tear anything.

               BELLA kicks off her shoes. There is a burst of passion 
               between them. For JACK, a continuation of the violence 
               with the MAN on the street.

               For BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks 
               over the bedside lamp.

               JACK spreads BELLA on the bed. She tugs his trousers down. 
               He rips her black underwear away.

               INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Later. JACK is lying sprawled on the bed with BELLA. She 
               reaches across him and retrieves the fallen lamp.

                                     BELLA
                         It's funny, isn't it? If that guy 
                         hadn't come up to you, you wouldn't 
                         be here now.

               JACK strokes her bottom.

                                     JACK
                         I hate cheats.

                                     BELLA
                         All men are cheats.

               BELLA picks up a joint from the bedside and lights it.

                                     BELLA
                         I spent two years on the game. I 
                         don't mind telling you that.

               JACK looks at her.

                                     BELLA
                         But don't worry, I'm clean as a 
                         whistle. I only did S & M.
                              (she hands the joint 
                              to JACK,)
                         No blow jobs. No screwing.

                                     JACK
                         Why did you quit?

                                     BELLA
                         I got scared.

                                     JACK
                              (inhales)
                         I can imagine.

                                     BELLA
                         Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. 
                         At least the punters keep their 
                         hands to themselves.

                                     JACK
                         You called the casino a cesspit.

                                     BELLA
                         Well it is. But I know where I am.

               JACK hands the joint back to BELLA.

                                     BELLA
                         I've been watching you work. You're 
                         the best in the place. But you 
                         know that.

                                     JACK
                         I despise the job.

                                     BELLA
                         Ah, we all say that. But if we 
                         hate it, why do we do it?

               JACK doesn't answer.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack wanted to say we do it for 
                         the money. But that wasn't really 
                         true.

               BELLA leans over JACK and begins gently to massage his 
               flesh.

                                     BELLA
                         What do you really want to do?

               She puts the joint in an ashtray.

                                     JACK
                         The Indian rope-trick.

                                     BELLA
                         Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm 
                         sorry. It's none of my business.  
                         It's just that you're not like the 
                         others.

                                     JACK
                         Not like Matt, you mean.

                                     BELLA
                         Now he's a real shit. Don't get 
                         friendly with him. I'm sure he's 
                         got his hand in the till. You know 
                         what he said to me once? "I want 
                         to fuck the whole world over. That's 
                         my mission." The shit!

               BELLA touches a bruise on JACK'S body.

                                     JACK
                         Ouch.

                                     BELLA
                         Sorry.

               She kisses the bruised skin, pulls him to her. BELLA simply 
               wants to be held.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack could hear Matt saying it...

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

               JACK is at his desk typing intently. There is a pile of 
               new pages in the sunlight.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         "I want to fuck the whole world 
                         over. It's my mission."

               MARION passes in the foreground. She kisses him on the 
               back of his head and leaves. JACK'S fingers move across 
               the keyboard, dancing.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         At last he had found what he'd 
                         been looking for. A clear and simple 
                         theme. And a hero to act it out. 
                         Little Matt...
                              (Pause)
                         ...Chapter One.

               INT. CASINO - WASHROOM - NIGHT

               MATT is shaving.

                                     MATT
                         I look like shit.

               JACK is scrubbing his nails at a basin.

                                     JACK
                         Rough day?

                                     MATT
                         Rough life, Jack.

               A YOUNG WOMAN appears in the mirror behind the two MEN. 
               Her name is PAT. She is dressed like BELLA.

                                     PAT
                         Hi. I'm Pat.

               MATT and JACK say 'Hello'. MATT appraises PAT'S appearance, 
               winks approval at JACK.

                                     JACK
                              (to Matt)
                         What happened to Bella?

                                     MATT
                         I'll tell you later.

               JACK is mystified.

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

               JACK is dealing to MR TCHAI and three OTHER MEN. One chair 
               at the table is empty.

                                     MR TCHAI
                         What happened to Bella?

                                     JACK
                         She was re-assigned.

               JACK shows 13. He turns over his third card, a King. The 
               bank busts. JACK pays out.

               JANI sits down in the vacant chair. JACK conceals his 
               surprise, a hint of nervousness.

                                     JACK
                              (formally)
                         Good evening.

               JANI nods impassively.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack knew this was no coincidence. 
                         Why had she come?

               The MEN look at the glamorous woman. MR TCHAI doesn't 
               register her presence. He is as inscrutable as his BODYGUARD 
               who hands him an envelope. JANI takes out money from her 
               purse. JACK counts it.

                                     JANI
                         One thousand even. In fifties.

               JACK slots the money down, counts out 20 £50 chips. JACK 
               deals. Bets are placed. 100 from JANI. The cards turn. MR 
               TCHAI splits two aces. JANI has a 6 and 7. MR TCHAI receives 
               two los and wins big. JANI gets a 10 and busts.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He wondered if she believed he 
                         would bring her luck...

               JANI'S face is impassive. She receives her cards...

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               JANI busts again. JACK sweeps away the chips, the cards. 
               JANI reaches into her bag, takes out another thousand 
               pounds.

                                     JANI
                         In fifties.

               The MEN at the table look at JANI.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Or did she think he would help her 
                         win?

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

               JANI loses again. She is down to 4 chips. She looks up at 
               JACK. Their eyes meet, hers desperate, his helpless. MR 
               TCHAI picks up on the look.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He knew how to fix it for her. His 
                         father had taught him the trick. 
                         Switch the sequence. Bust the bank. 
                         The casino wouldn't spot it. But 
                         Jack was wary of the punters...

               JACK glances at the MEN at the table.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He could see Mr Tchai was counting. 
                         He couldn't risk it.

               JANI places her last bet, glances at the mountain of chips 
               in front of MR TCHAI. JACK catches her look. He deals. 
               JANI reaches for her next card. JACK observes her left 
               hand.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He noticed she wasn't wearing her 
                         ring. Why not? Odds on she'd sold 
                         it.

               JACK plays out the hand. JANI loses. She immediately gets 
               up. She is crushed.

                                     JANI
                         Good night. Thank you.

               She walks away from the table.

                                     JACK
                         Good night.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Thank you, she said. For what, 
                         Jack thought. Jani de Villiers 
                         knew the odds.

               TCHAI looks at JACK.

                                     MR TCHAI
                         Pretty woman.

               INT. JACK'S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK is sitting on the bed fully clothed. He is carefully 
               sewing a button on his croupier's jacket. Through the open 
               bedroom door MARION can be seen sitting on the sofa, legs 
               tucked under her, reading the new typescript.

               The phone rings. In the bedroom JACK picks up.

                                     JACK
                         Hello...

               EXT. SOUTH AFRICA CASINO - NIGHT

               JACK SR. is in a public phone. Coloured lanterns hang round 
               in the night. Distant laughter.

                                     JACK SR
                         How's it going, Jacko?

               INTERCUT between JACK and JACK SR.

                                     JACK
                         Fine. I took the job.

                                     JACKSR
                         Good for you. I was wondering what 
                         happened.

                                     JACK
                         I tried to call you, dad, but they 
                         said your line was disconnected.

                                     JACK SR
                              (jovially)
                         Ah yes, I moved house. Needed a 
                         bigger place. How's that book of 
                         yours coming along?

               In the sitting room MARION looks towards JACK in the 
               bedroom.

                                     JACK
                         I'm getting there.

                                     JACK SR
                         It's good to have the job to fall 
                         back on, isn't it?
                              (pause)
                         There goes my other phone.

                                     JACK
                         Goodbye dad.

               He hangs up. MARION turns the last page of the typescript. 
               She's finished.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK comes in from the bedroom. MARION says nothing. She 
               puts the typescript down. JACK waits.

               MARION gets off the sofa.

                                     MARION
                         I don't like it.

                                     JACK
                         Why not?

                                     MARION
                         I don't like it at all. You had a 
                         wonderful character before, the 
                         Gambler. He was so romantic.

                                     JACK
                         He was a loser. This guy's a 
                         croupier. He can't lose. People 
                         have shat on him all his life. Now 
                         he's in control. He's a winner.

                                     MARION
                         Is that your idea of a winner? He 
                         doesn't give a shit about anyone. 
                         He uses people and --

                                     JACK
                              (interrupting)
                         -- It's because of the sex, isn't 
                         it? You don't like the sex in it.

                                     MARION
                         I don't give a fuck about the sex. 
                         Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's 
                         just a miserable zombie. Is that 
                         the way you feel now? Is that what's 
                         happened to you?

                                     JACK
                         Marion. It's a book.

                                     MARION
                         Oh really. Then why is he called 
                         Jake. Why don't you come clean and 
                         call him Jack.
                              (softens)
                         There's no hope in it.

                                     JACK
                         It's the truth.

                                     MARION
                         Without hope there's no point to 
                         anything.

                                     JACK
                         Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful 
                         about your job? Spending the day 
                         catching poor people stealing. You 
                         said yourself the organised gangs 
                         get away with it. At least in the 
                         casino everybody gets caught. Rich 
                         or poor, the odds are the same. 
                         It's all relative.

                                     MARION
                         Crap. It's not relative. It's 
                         unfair. Like your casino. It's 
                         designed unfair. And your croupier's 
                         a little shit because he goes along 
                         with it.

               JACK sees MARION is getting really angry. He crosses the 
               room, Pointedly takes MARION'S handbag, opens it, takes 
               out a National Lottery card and receipt. The doorbell rings.

                                     JACK
                              (coldly)
                         You're just like all those other 
                         dummies out there. Fourteen and a 
                         half million to one! Is that your 
                         idea of hope?

               The doorbell rings again.

                                     MARION
                         The door, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         Leave it.

                                     MARION
                         No. Answer it!

               JACK hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens 
               it.  BELLA stands there.

                                     BELLA
                         You fucking little shit! You shopped 
                         me.

                                     JACK
                         What are you talking about?

               MARION watches, numb.

                                     BELLA
                         Reynolds got a doctor in. They 
                         forced me to take a dope test. It 
                         was positive. As you knew.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know anything about it.

               BELLA looks over to MARION.

                                     BELLA
                         Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked 
                         my dope, then shopped me. What do 
                         you think of that? I can't get a 
                         job now.
                              (to Jack)
                         You bastard. You're no different 
                         from Matt. A pair of vicious little 
                         shits, that's what you are.

                                     JACK
                              (firmly)
                         Look Bella, I don't know anything 
                         about this. You should talk to 
                         Matt.

                                     BELLA
                         You're all scumbags.

                                     MARION
                         I agree.

               Without looking at MARION, BELLA suddenly kisses JACK on 
               the lips. BELLA looks hard at JACK, then leaves. JACK 
               pursues her.

               EXT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

               BELLA runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top.

                                     JACK
                         Bella!

               Without looking back she flings the gate shut, goes off 
               down the street. JACK turns.

                                     MARION
                         Go on. Go after her!

               MARION slams the door to the flat. JACK is half-way up the 
               stairs, alone.

               EXT. PICCADILLY DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

               The rush hour. 6 in the evening. JACK watches MEN and WOMEN 
               coming out the store.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack had no idea where Marion was 
                         staying, or with whom. He realised 
                         he knew little about her life. But 
                         then, he had never asked about it.

               JACK now sees MARION. He is about to go up to her, moving 
               through the flow of the crowd, then he stops.

               A MAN in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets MARION. 
               He's been waiting for her. JACK watches the two of them, 
               unseen.

               The MAN and MARION exchange a few words. She smiles, takes 
               his arm. He leans forward to kiss her.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         For the first time in a long while 
                         Jack thought about his mother. 
                         She'd left when she couldn't take 
                         it any more.  His father had said 
                         'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come 
                         back.' She didn't.

               JACK turns and walks away.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         But Marion wasn't his mother...

               INT. CASINO - CROWS NEST - NIGHT

               JACK stands behind REYNOLDS who is playing back a video of 
               the earlier incident in which MATT cheated with the GREEK.

                                     JACK
                         He's paying out in stacks of 25.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         I can see.

               He freezes the frame, presses a button, zooms in on the 
               detail of MATT's hand covering the chips.

               On another video monitor MATT is dealing blackjack. REYNOLDS 
               looks at the screen.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Little shit.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Chapter Three. His existence was 
                         forming an interesting pattern of 
                         betrayals. Sometimes he was unsure 
                         whether he was the betrayer or the 
                         betrayed.

               REYNOLDS looks up from the screen.

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (grudgingly)
                         Thanks for the information.

                                     JACK
                         A pleasure. Pity about Bella.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         She was a real asset. But what 
                         could I do?

               JACK lights a cigarette.

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (shakes his head)
                         Sorry. No smoking in the Nest, 
                         Jack.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

               Working at his computer, JACK lights one cigarette from 
               another. He pauses from his typing. On the desk beside him 
               is the note with JANI's phone number. He picks up the phone, 
               starts to dial, then stops, replaces the receiver. He looks 
               distracted, lost. On the table MARION'S flowers are dead 
               in the vase.

               INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

               JACK comes downstairs from the upper floor. He is looking 
               at a book he has selected: 'SCARNE ON CARDS'.

               Across from the cash desk near the entrance a book signing 
               is in progress. A small crowd surrounds a Middle Eastern 
               author called HABIB dressed in a kaftan. GILES is with 
               him. A PHOTOGRAPHER is there. A few camera flashes.

               GILES sees JACK at the cash desk. He is uncertain for a 
               moment, then smiles.

                                     GILES
                              (calling)
                         Jack!

               Hearing his name, JACK turns. GILES comes over.

                                     GILES
                         I thought it was you. It's the 
                         hair!

                                     JACK
                              (touching the back 
                              of his neck)
                         I'm working on that soccer story.

                                     GILES
                              (vaguely)
                         Right.
                              (suddenly)
                         Look, I must get back to Habib.

                                     JACK
                         Habib?

                                     GILES
                         My author. He's a Terrorist. He's 
                         written a kill-and-tell book.
                              (puts his hand on 
                              Jack's shoulder)
                         Take care.

               GILES heads back to the signing. The CASHIER puts JACK'S 
               book in a bag. GILES stops, thinking of something. He comes 
               back to JACK.

                                     GILES
                         Jack, look, next weekend I'm having 
                         a house party. Here...
                              (removes a card 
                              from his pocket 
                              book)
                         It's near Oxford. Why don't you 
                         come? It'll just be social. No 
                         business.
                              (conspiratorially)
                         Bring a friend. I've plenty of 
                         room.

                                     JACK
                              (looks at the card)
                         I'll try and make it.

                                     GILES
                         Looking forward!

               GILES goes back to his group. JACK looks round the 
               bookstore, sees thousands of books in piles.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Books piled like chips. Stack 'em 
                         high. Sell 'em fast. Make a killing. 
                         You think you're a gambler, Giles, 
                         but you're not. You're a dealer.

               A camera flash.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               JANI'S white Honda winds its way through the wintry 
               Oxfordshire countryside. The moon is bright.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Chapter Four...

               INT. HONDA - NIGHT

               JANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving. JACK, beside her, 
               reads a map with a torch.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know how you can drive at 
                         night with those glasses.

               She turns and smiles at him. Her left hand is bandaged.

                                     JACK
                         How did you hurt your hand?

                                     JANI
                         Just an accident. Nothing.

                                     JACK
                         Turn left ahead.

               The car turns into a lane.

                                     JACK
                         Jani, there's something I want to 
                         say. Before we get there. I don't 
                         know what the sleeping arrangements 
                         are. Giles probably expects us to 
                         share a room.

                                     JANI
                         That's fine.

               EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Honda's tyres crackle on the gravel drive which leads 
               to a floodlit yellow stone country house. There are three 
               cars parked outside the entrance. The Honda stops next to 
               them.

               INT. HONDA - NIGHT

               JACK prepares to get out. JANI catches his arm. She takes 
               off her dark glasses. Her right eye is bruised.

                                     JANI
                         There's no point pretending it was 
                         an accident. I had a fight with 
                         someone, that's all.

               In the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being 
               struck.

               EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - TENNIS COURT - NIGHT

               A floodlit tennis court. A racquet smacks a tennis ball. 
               JACK sits with GILES drinking Bloody Marys watching a game 
               of mixed doubles.

               Everybody's wearing sweaters. JANI is playing with one of 
               GILES'S friends, GORDON. On the other side, two girls, 
               FIONA from Giles' office, and CHLOE, Gordon's girlfriend.

               JACK follows JANI'S game. She is far and away the best of 
               the four.

               GILES is also studying JANI's movements, her knickers when 
               she serves.

                                     GILES
                         She's a dab hand With a racquet, 
                         your friend.

                                     JACK
                         South African women are very sporty.

               JACK watches JANI'S strong leg muscles as she moves about 
               the court.

                                     GILES
                         I can see. How did she get that 
                         shiner?

               JACK has been waiting for this.

                                     JACK
                         I found her in bed with someone.

                                     GILES
                              (surprised)
                         Who was he?

                                     JACK
                         She.

                                     GIEES
                         I say. You're a dark horse, Jack.

               On court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash. The four 
               PLAYERS shake hands across the net. They come off the court. 
               GORDON puts his arm around JANI. His girlfriend CHLOE 
               notices. JACK is irritated. GILES catches the moment.

                                     GORDON
                              (to Jack)
                         You don't play tennis?

                                     JACK
                         I don't play anything.

                                     GORDON
                         How boring for you.

               JANI moves deliberately away from GORDON, who clearly 
               fancies her, and sits down beside JACK. She pointedly kisses 
               him on the cheek. GILES glances at GORDON, who shrugs. 
               FIONA comes up to GILES.

                                     FIONA
                         Where's our drinks?

                                     CHLOE
                         They're so bloody selfish.

                                     JANI
                              (to Jack)
                         I'm so glad you brought me.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack wouldn't have come without 
                         her.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK and JANI, GILES, GORDON and their two GIRLFRIENDS are 
               sitting down with drinks at a card table. GORDON opens a 
               fresh deck of cards.

                                     JACK
                         I don't gamble.

                                     GILES
                         Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a 
                         few quid.

                                     JACK
                         It's nothing to do with money. I 
                         don't gamble.

               GILES looks to JANI to persuade him.

                                     JANI
                         He doesn't gamble.

                                     JACK
                         I'll watch.

                                     GORDON
                              (insinuatingly)
                         Jack likes to watch.
                              (to Jani)
                         Does he like to watch?

               JACK is getting angry. JANI is calm.

                                     JANI
                              (to Gordon)
                         One more remark like that and I'll 
                         break your balls.

               There is silence. GORDON is embarrassed. FIONA looks at 
               CHLOE, they're shocked and impressed. JACK smiles.

                                     GILES
                              (laughs)
                         I'll bet she could, too.

               JACK defuses the atmosphere.

                                     JACK
                         I'll deal, but I won't play.

               He sits down, picks up the cards.

                                     GORDON
                         You sure you know how?

               JACK takes the pack of cards, splits it expertly into two, 
               shuffles by pressing the two halves together open-palmed. 
               There is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically 
               into one another, leaving the pack as if it hadn't been 
               shuffled. FIONA and CHLOE are fascinated.

                                     FIONA
                         Do that again.

               JACK gives the cards to his right, GORDON cuts them. Another 
               immaculate professional shuffle, and out come the cards 
               from JACK'S right hand, flicking across the table.

               As the cards land, they fall exactly next to one another 
               in front of each player.

                                     CHLOE
                         That's sexy.

               At the end of the deal, five players are looking at a neat 
               fan of five cards before them.

                                     FIONA
                         Don't they look pretty.

               They all pick up their cards.

                                     GILES
                              (frowns)
                         There's nothing pretty about this 
                         hand.

                                     CHLOE
                         You're not supposed to talk, Giles.

                                     FIONA
                         He's probably lying. He does that.

               JACK catches JANI's eye. She winks.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

               Later. JACK deals the cards.

                                     JACK
                         Last hand.

                                     GILES
                         Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't 
                         we...

                                     FIONA
                              (sharply)
                         No! No stripping.

                                     CHLOE
                         Right. We're not having that again!
                              (glances at Jack)
                         Although...

                                     GORDON
                         I'll stick to bluffing. That's 
                         what I'm best at.

               JANI smiles, says nothing. JACK slides the pack to JANI. 
               She looks up at him and cuts the cards. JACK deals the 
               cards deftly. The FIVE PLAYERS pick up their cards.

               Before each player calls we hear Jack's voice. In the end 
               he correctly predicts their call. Is it telepathy? Or 
               something else?

                                     GORDON
                         I'll stick.

                                     FIONA
                         Two cards.

                                     GILES
                         One card.

                                     CHLOE
                         Oh I don't know...Er...two cards.

                                     JANI
                         Three cards.

               The PLAYERS examine their hands. The WOMEN are pleased. 
               The MEN say nothing. JANI puts her cards together.

               The betting begins. No one drops out. The raising goes 
               round three times.

                                     FIONA
                         That's it. I haven't got any more 
                         cash.

               The betting comes to an end. JACK watches as they turn 
               their hands over. GORDON turns over a Straight.

                                     GORDON
                         Beat that.

               CHLOE turns over a Flush.

                                     CHLOE
                         Ha. Ha. Ha.

                                     GORDON
                         Shit.

               FIONA turns over a Full House.

                                     FIONA
                         Not so fast, darling.

                                     GORDON
                              (disbelieving)
                         Hang on, chaps. That's impossible!

               GILES turns over four of a kind.

                                     GILES
                         How's about that for impossible.

               Laughter, cries of amazement.

                                     GORDON
                         What's going on?

               JACK is impassive. They all look to JANI, who turns over, 
               one card at a time, a Straight Flush.

                                     CHLOE
                         Wow. What are the odds for this 
                         happening?

               More laughter, cries of amazement.

                                     FIONA
                         Thousands to one.

                                     JACK
                         42,300,000 to 1.

                                     JANI
                         Approximately.

                                     GORDON
                         I could've won if I'd been able to 
                         bluff.

               JANI leans forward and takes the pot. GILES looks at JACK, 
               then at JANI.

                                     GILES
                         I get it.

                                     JACK
                         Get what?
                              (smiles)
                         Are you accusing me of cheating?

                                     GILES
                         Good God, no. But with skill like 
                         that, what do you want a job for? 
                         You don't need to work.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK sits on the side of a four-poster bed and takes off 
               his shoes. On the other side of the bed JANI unzips her 
               skirt. She looks round the room.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Here was an interesting question. 
                         Was writing work... or play?

               JANI puts her skirt over a chair and goes into the bathroom. 
               She doesn't close the door. JACK continues undressing. 
               From a hold-all he removes a pair of pajamas. He glances 
               at the open bathroom door, then climbs into his pajamas. 
               He has two ugly bruises on his chest from the fight with 
               the ARABIC MAN.

               JANI comes out of the bathroom naked. She sees his body.

                                     JANI
                         What happened?

                                     JACK
                         Remember the guy who cheated at 
                         the table?

                                     JANI
                         You don't like cheats, do you.

               She walks across to her case, opens it, rummages around 
               and takes out a nightie. This, without the slightest hint 
               of embarrassment. JACK goes into the bathroom to brush his 
               teeth. JANI climbs into bed.

                                     JANI
                         Which side do you like?

                                     JACK
                              (calling)
                         You choose.

               They get into bed.

                                     JANI
                         That trick tonight, I don't think 
                         I've ever seen that before.

                                     JACK
                         It can only work with amateurs, A 
                         pro would have spotted it.

                                     JANI
                         I didn't.

                                     JACK
                         Then you're not a pro.

               JANI leans over and turns off the lamp. Her hair brushes 
               JACK'S face.

                                     JANI
                         Goodnight.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

               In the deserted hall is a nineteenth century painting, a 
               copy of Gericault's 'Raft of the Medusa'. The picture light 
               illuminates the group of men and women, clinging to the 
               raft and to each other.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                     JANI'S VOICE
                         Jack...? I need your help...

               JACK wakes drowsily.

                                     JANI
                         I'm in trouble.

                                     JACK
                         What kind of trouble?

                                     JANI
                         I owe a lot of money.

                                     JACK
                         Was that why you did the two grand? 
                         I couldn't help you.

                                     JANI
                         I know that. But you can now.

                                     JACK
                         I don't have any money.  switches 
                         on the light. JANI is looking 
                         distressed.

                                     JANI
                         Some people I know, they're planning 
                         to rob The Golden Lion.

               JACK sits up, turns on the lamp.

                                     JACK
                         You don't mean that.

               JANI pulls up the bedcover around her body.

                                     JANI
                         They mean it.

                                     JACK
                         Who's they?

                                     JANI
                         My creditors. One night, around 
                         three in the morning, they'll come 
                         into the casino -

                                     JACK
                              (interrupting)
                         Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.

                                     JANI
                         The point is, they want a man 
                         inside.

                                     JACK
                              (laughs)
                         And I thought you were a bright 
                         woman.

                                     JANI
                         Just listen. You don't have to do 
                         anything criminal.

                                     JACK
                              (smiles)
                         Robbery's not criminal?

               JACK gets out of bed, tours the room.

                                     JANI
                         You don't have to be criminal. A 
                         man will come up to your table and 
                         deliberately cheat. You'll see 
                         him, stop him, and the guy will 
                         make a big scene. There'll be chaos. 
                         And that's when it'll happen.

                                     JACK
                         You're serious.

                                     JANI
                         You won't be committing a crime. 
                         The man will cheat, you'll just be 
                         doing your job, that's all.

               JACK comes right up close to JANI in bed.

                                     JACK
                         And I thought you were only after 
                         my body.

                                     JANI
                         I've come to know you. You're 
                         honest.
                              (takes his hand)
                         I trust you.

                                     JACK
                         What'll you do when it all goes 
                         wrong?

                                     JANI
                         It won't.

                                     JACK
                         But if it does.

                                     JANI
                         You keep the ten thousand pounds.

                                     JACK
                         What ten thousand pounds?

               JANI gets out of bed.

                                     JANI
                         These people will pay you ten 
                         thousand before and ten thousand 
                         after. They want someone they can 
                         be sure of, an honest dealer. That's 
                         the point. Not all dealers are 
                         honest. Mr Reynolds will never 
                         suspect you.

                                     JACK
                         Reynolds? You've done your research.

               She puts her hand on his.

                                     JANI
                         I didn't know what else to do. 
                         You're my last chance.

               She takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye.

                                     JANI
                         Next time it'll be my neck.

                                     JACK
                         What about my neck?

               JANI is close to breaking down. Her toughness evaporates.

                                     JANI
                         I want to go back to Cape Town, I 
                         want to start again, clean.

                                     JACK
                         I can't do it, Jani.

                                     JANI
                         I'm asking you, as a...friend. 
                         You'd be saving the life of a 
                         friend.

               JANI goes back to bed. She turns out the light. JACK stands 
               in the middle of the dark room.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - STAIRS - NIGHT

               JACK comes out of the bedroom in his pajamas, wearing his 
               hat. He walks slowly down the passage. He hears the sounds 
               of love-making coming from one of the rooms. He passes 
               'The Raft of the Medusa' as he goes down the stairs.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               JACK comes into the kitchen, switches on the light. He 
               goes to the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of vodka. He 
               washes a dirty glass and pours himself a drink.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack wondered why he was even 
                         considering it. Ten grand. In cash. 
                         That was why. But Jack didn't need 
                         the money. His father would have 
                         taken it, like a shot. But his 
                         father was a gambler.

               He downs his drink, and leaves the kitchen.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - NIGHT

               JACK walks back to his room. There is silence now, no sounds 
               of sex.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He was always broke. Jake suddenly 
                         realised... it was Jake who was 
                         considering it.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK comes in, tosses his hat on the bed. JANI isn't in 
               the bed. The bathroom door is afar. He hears the sounds of 
               gasping. He rushes to the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               JANI is holding her head over the lavatory bowl. JACK runs 
               some water in the basin. He helps her to her feet and gives 
               her a glass of water.

               She washes out her mouth. She looks at him, tears running 
               down her face.

                                     JANI
                         I want you to forget what I said.

                                     JACK
                         Wait a minute...

                                     JANI
                         No, forget it. The bet's off.

               She reaches forward for a toothbrush and starts to clean 
               her teeth.

                                     JACK
                         What about your father? Can he 
                         help?

               She spits the water out of her mouth, kisses him on the 
               forehead and goes back into the bedroom. JACK looks at his 
               reflection in the bathroom mirror. He strokes his hair 
               down.

                                     JACK
                         Why don't you just go back to South 
                         Africa?

               He leaves the bathroom.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK gets back in bed with JANI. They turn away from each 
               other and prepare to sleep.

                                     JACK
                         How much do you owe?

                                     JANI
                         Let it go.

                                     JACK
                         Did they tell you to sleep with 
                         me?

                                     JANI
                         I told you, all bets are off.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

               JACK wakes as JANI is dressed getting ready to leave. She 
               bends and kisses him.

                                     JANI
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JACK
                         What for?

                                     JANI
                         I have to take the car.

               She looks at him then leaves the room

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Hang on tightly... let go lightly.

               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               JACK comes into the kitchen. GILES is making coffee. CHLOE 
               is sitting at the table, half-asleep in her nightgown.

                                     GILES
                         Good night?

                                     JACK
                         Not particularly.

                                     GILES
                         And your lady?

                                     JACK
                         She had to leave early. She asked 
                         me to thank you.

                                     GILES
                         A bit unexpected, wasn't it?

                                     JACK
                         Not entirely.

                                     GILES
                         How's that football story corning 
                         along?

                                     JACK
                         You said it was going to be social, 
                         Giles. No business.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He was overcome with a sense of 
                         urgency. He had to get it down... 
                         Chapter Five.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               JACK comes in, puts down his overnight bag. He yawns, heads 
               for the bedroom. Suddenly, he sees that the vase of dead 
               flowers is now full of fresh blooms. Underneath is a small 
               box, gift-wrapped. JACK opens it. Inside the tissue paper 
               is a tiny gold charm on a chain. He examines it.

               CLOSE-UP: The charm is a book, no title engraved.

               JACK is touched.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               JACK comes into the room. MARION is in bed asleep. He looks 
               at her, smiles.

               He starts to get undressed. MARION stirs. JACK puts the 
               book charm around his neck. She moves from the middle to 
               one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the 
               charm.

                                     JACK
                         It's beautiful. Thank you.

                                     MARION
                         I hope it brings you luck.

                                     JACK
                         It will.

               MARION I haven't brought you much luck, have I? Perhaps we 
               shouldn't be together.

                                     JACK
                         That girl, she works at the casino --

                                     MARION
                         -- I don't care about her. Of 
                         course, I was angry. But not with 
                         you. The book is yours not mine. I 
                         was wrong, what I said about it. I 
                         hurt you, didn't I?

                                     JACK
                         You're entitled to your opinion.

                                     MARION
                         It's none of my business what you 
                         write. And your job, that's none 
                         of my business either. I love you. 
                         And I've done everything wrong.

               JACK takes her in his arms.

                                     JACK
                         I'll leave the casino soon.
                              (he strokes her 
                              hair)
                         I promise.

                                     MARION
                         You will?

                                     JACK
                         Within a month. Believe me, I'm 
                         going to quit!

               They begin to make love. She holds the back of his head.

                                     MARION
                         Then you can dye your hair blond 
                         again.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               JACK is asleep in bed with MARION. He is murmuring 
               indistinguishable words. It wakes her. She gently touches 
               his shoulder. He opens his eyes.

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MARION
                         You were talking in your sleep.

                                     JACK
                         Not talking. Writing.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

               JACK is at work alone. The phone rings. He leaves it and 
               continues I working. Then he hears JANI'S VOICE.

                                     JANI'S VOICE
                         I need to see you. I've moved. I 
                         have a new number. It's 468-3275. 
                         Please call me.

               There is a click. JACK scribbles the number down and resumes 
               work.

               INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

               JACK gets off a train. He is dressed as a croupier. He 
               walks to a public telephone on the platform, taking JANI'S 
               note from his pocket. He dials the number. The noise of 
               the train and PASSENGERS makes it difficult to hear. The 
               phone at the end rings and rings. JACK waits.

                                     JACK
                         I want to speak to Jani de 
                         Villiers...
                              (waits)
                         Jani... it's Jack... I'll come 
                         over now...

               He takes out a notepad and writes down the address.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               JACK walks down a street of rough, transient's hotels. The 
               street lamps are on.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Chapter Seven... Jack had decided 
                         to see her. The challenge was 
                         essential.

               He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in.

               INT. HOTEL. STAIRS - NIGHT

               JACK climbs the creaking stairs under the fluorescent 
               lights. He knocks on a door. JANI opens it. She wears men's 
               pajamas. She looks unslept.

                                     JANI
                         Come in.

               She glances up and down the passage. JACK goes in.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               JANI carefully closes the door. JACK looks round the dingy 
               room.

                                     JANI
                         It's not the Ritz this time.

               She switches on a standard lamp, looks at him.

                                     JANI
                         Is it yes?

                                     JACK
                         Yes.

                                     JANI
                         Thank you.

               Reflected in a mirror, she opens her bag and takes out an 
               envelope, gives it to JACK. He looks inside. Four bank 
               packets of £2500.

                                     JACK
                         It doesn't seem fair. You're 
                         offering me ten grand in cash but 
                         you can't afford a decent place.

                                     JANI
                         Well, life's not fair. We know 
                         that.

                                     JACK
                         It's all relative.  I need the 
                         money too.

                                     JANI
                         Do you?

                                     JACK
                         Yes.

                                     JANI
                         The date's not set yet. I'll call 
                         you. One last thing: the man you're 
                         going to catch cheating, he may 
                         get violent. But you know how to 
                         deal with cheats.

                                     JACK
                              (looks at her face)
                         That bruise has cleared up nicely.

                                     JANI
                         Bruise?
                              (touches her eye)
                         Oh, yes. It's better.

                                     JACK
                              (touches his chest)
                         I've still got mine.

               JACK looks at her hand.

                                     JACK
                         And your hand too.

                                     JANI
                              (coolly)
                         I took the bandage off yesterday.

               She crosses to pick up a bottle of Scotch.

                                     JANI
                         Would you like a drink?

                                     JACK
                         No thank you.

               JACK puts the envelope in his pocket. They look at each 
               other.

                                     JACK
                         I don't think we should meet again.

                                     JANI
                              (nods)
                         It's a shame there aren't more men 
                         in the world like you.

               JACK goes up to JANI and kisses her on the mouth. She puts 
               an arm around him.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         There was a part of Jani he really 
                         liked.

               He turns and leaves the room.

               EXT. HOTEL - STREET - NIGHT

               JACK comes out of the hotel, walks up the street.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Question: Was he gambling, taking 
                         Jani's money? Answer: No. Because 
                         he wasn't betting with his own 
                         money. He was being paid in advance 
                         for a service...

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               At the roulette table JACK spins the wheel, throws the 
               ball.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         In reality there were two clear 
                         elements of risk in this exchange. 
                         One: the possibility the cash was 
                         counterfeit. Two: the possibility 
                         Jani or her creditors would want 
                         the money back if the plan failed.

               A MIDDLE-AGED MAN is sweating. He fingers his last 2 chips. 
               He reaches for a number, hesitates. JACK sees that the 
               MAN's hand is shaking.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         To begin with he put the odds at 2 
                         against. 7 for. He checked a random 
                         selection of bills at a bank. They 
                         were all good.

               Across the table a well-dressed JEWISH WOMAN in her fifties 
               is sitting next to a YOUNG MAN, a gigolo type, the top 
               three buttons of his shirt undone. She too hesitates with 
               her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty 
               turns.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         So now his odds were decidedly 
                         better. He put them at 8 to 1. The 
                         fact that the notes were good gave 
                         him one less negative. 2 minus 1. 
                         At the same time mathematically he 
                         had one more positive. 7 plus 1.

               The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the 
               chip.

                                     WOMAN
                         Bring me some luck.

               The YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21.

               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays 
               silently.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               The roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of 
               numbers.

                                     JACK
                         No more bets.

               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her 
               hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Next stage. He had to be secure at 
                         8 to 1 against having to give the 
                         money back, so he wouldn't spend 
                         it. If after one month no one had 
                         approached him, he calculated the 
                         odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. 
                         After three months he figured 100 
                         to 1 no one would turn up.

               The ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. 
               She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing 
               her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in 
               her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure.

               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of 
               misery on his face.

               JACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor 
               winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides 
               them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he 
               prepares to pay out the WOMAN.

               No one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The 
               MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically. 
               The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK.

               The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile 
               of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         How about a drink to celebrate?

               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, 
               relief.

                                     MAN
                              (to Jack)
                         Cash me in.

               JACK converts the green coloured chips to £35 in house 
               chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally.

               The MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the 
               next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette 
               table.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jake's experiment with the man 
                         would prove the point.

               The MAN hesitates. He can't resist.

               In CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         People don't change.

               INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               MARION drops a plate as she's drying the dishes. She swears 
               and bends to pick up the pieces.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               MARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry 
               basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest 
               of drawers for another. She can't find one among the 
               underwear.

               She goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She 
               unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of £2500.

               She bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously.

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

               JACK pushes several £50 notes into the slot and counts out 
               two piles of chips for a PUNTER in front of him.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He watched their faces as they 
                         lost hour after hour, night after 
                         night, relentlessly.

               JACK'S FACE as he deals.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He questioned the conventional 
                         wisdom that gamblers are self-
                         destructive...

               The FACES of PUNTERS around the table: concentration, 
               grimness, apprehension...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He had come to believe that in 
                         reality, they want to destroy 
                         everyone else - their families and 
                         loved ones, everyone. Fuck over 
                         the whole world...

               The white balls lands. The FACES of the LOSERS, resigned, 
               desperate, angry....

               The PUNTERS who are cleaned out get off their chairs, tear 
               up their sequence cards, turn and walk away, quickly, 
               slowly.

               ON JACK'S FACE:

                         Without emotion he watched them 
                         go. Jake stayed.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               MARION is lying awake alone in bed. The phone rings. She 
               leans over to pick it up, then doesn't. From the sitting 
               room comes the message:

                                     JANI'S VOICE
                         It's set. The day after tomorrow. 
                         The twenty-fourth. Good luck.

               Click. MARION gets out of bed. She goes into the sitting 
               room.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               MARION replays the message. She stares at the phone. Then 
               carefully she presses the ERASE button, wiping the message. 
               She goes back into the bedroom.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

               JACK is at work. MARION'S hands are massaging his shoulders. 
               The little book charm dangles round his neck.

                                     MARION
                         Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?

                                     JACK
                              (looks up)
                         Never. Why do you ask?

                                     MARION
                         I can just imagine, being around 
                         so much money all the time...

                                     JACK
                         Gambling's not about money.

                                     MARION
                         Really?

                                     JACK
                         Gambling's about not facing reality. 
                         Ignoring the odds.

               She takes her hands away from his neck.

                                     MARION
                         I must be a fool. I never think 
                         about the odds.

               The sound of an underground train.

               INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

               JACK sits impassively among noisy Christmas TRAVELLERS. 
               The train stops. SOMEONE pops a balloon. JACK gets up and 
               alights, followed by a streamer. He disappears into the 
               crowd.

               INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

               JACK hangs up his hat and coat, examines himself in the 
               mirror. He picks up a small roll of paper. He unfurls it. 
               A Christmas party hat.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Chapter Twelve...

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               A Christmas festive atmosphere. The casino interior is 
               decorated with red and green balloons, silver and gold 
               streamers, a large tree hung with £1000 chips.

               JACK is dealing at a blackjack table. Like the other 
               croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat 
               with green trim. He wears a silly paper hat.

               The PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four 
               expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind 
               them. They are gambling big money. Wads of £50 notes are 
               changed into £100 chips.

               JACK is coolly winning for the house. REYNOLDS looks on 
               impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS 
               are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his 
               friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they 
               show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare 
               to lose even more. JACK pushes hundreds of pounds into the 
               box beneath the table.

               REYNOLDS signals a SECURITY MAN to collect the cash which 
               is building up. He comes over with a safety cart. During a 
               short break the money is taken from under the table in a 
               box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away.

               INT. CASINO - BAR - NIGHT

               TWO COLD-LOOKING MEN in suits are drinking mineral water 
               at the bar. They watch the SECURITY MAN with the cart pass 
               by and disappear through a green baize door marked PRIVATE.  
               One of the SUITS looks at his watch: five minutes to 
               midnight.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               JACK is now at a roulette table. He sees a PUNTER's watch: 
               2.45. The atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy, 
               laughter, loud voices. 1 One of the two MEN in suits from 
               the bar eases himself into a chair. JACK sees him. The 
               SUIT throws him £500.

                                     SUIT
                         Fifties. Ten of them.

                                     JACK
                         What colour chips?

                                     SUIT
                         Whatever.

               JACK gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale 
               blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours 
               used by the other punters. The SUIT looks at his watch.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               Two men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and 
               talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the 
               casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. 
               The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               The ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight 
               from the winners, 5 is heavily covered.

               The SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number 
               at the side.

               JACK Sees the obvious cheat. So do other PUNTERS.

                                     JACK
                              (stiffens)
                         Sir, I can't accept that bet.

               The SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK.

                                     SUIT
                         Are you calling me a cheat?

                                     PUNTER
                         You are a cheat. I saw you.

                                     SUIT
                              (grabbing Jack's 
                              lapel)
                         I'm talking to you.

               JACK pushes him away. The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his 
               fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT 
               grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, 
               knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. 
               They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER 
               tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They 
               fight, trading blows.

               At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see 
               the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The 
               BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table.

               TWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the 
               distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start 
               screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK 
               doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, 
               pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR 
               TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a 
               hammer blow to the head.

               The TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT, 
               who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A 
               strange, violent Christmas party.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               JACK lies groaning on the floor. MR TCHAI is standing, 
               watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy 
               system:

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Ladies and gentlemen, please be 
                         calm. There's no cause for alarm. 
                         Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas.

               REYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph 
               the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid 
               the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other 
               CHINESE leave the casino with the BODYGUARD.

               INT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT

               JACK is sitting in a Christmas-decorated cubicle, a curtain 
               drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has 
               two large plasters on his chest.

               The NURSE finishes the job, smiles.

                                     NURSE
                         There you go.

               She hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the 
               background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK 
               fingers the charm around his neck.

               There is a pause. Then the curtain is pulled back. MARION 
               enters. She carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of 
               Chinese take-away. JACK is surprised.

                                     JACK
                         How did you know I was here?

                                     MARION
                         I thought you wouldn't want to 
                         spend Christmas Day alone in here.

               She starts to pour wine. JACK is still puzzled.

                                     JACK
                         Did you go to the casino?

               MARION hands him a glass of wine.

                                     MARION
                         Happy Christmas.

               They touch glasses and drink.

                                     MARION
                         Now...noodles or rice?

               As she opens the cartons, JACK watches her, still uneasy.

                                     MARION
                              (quietly)
                         I don't want a criminal for a 
                         boyfriend.

                                     JACK
                              (suddenly)
                         There was a message, wasn't there?

                                     MARION
                         It's probably easier for you to 
                         eat the rice.

                                     JACK
                         Marion!  What did you tell the 
                         police?

                                     MARION
                         Nothing about you.

                                     JACK
                         Then what?

                                     MARION
                         Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or 
                         I'll shop you. All you have to do 
                         is keep your word. It's that simple.

               JACK sinks back on the bed. She hands him the rice dish.

                                     MARION
                         Here...use a spoon.

                                     JACK
                         Leave me alone, Marion.

                                     MARION
                         You're already alone.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He had always been alone. He had 
                         always believed it would make the 
                         decisions easier.

                                     JACK
                         All right. I don't want to lose 
                         you. I'll quit. I swear to you.

               MARION kisses him.

                                     MARION
                         Why did you take the money?

                                     JACK
                         I hate public transport.

                                     MARION
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         I want to buy a car.

                                     MARION
                              (laughs)
                         How can anyone be that naive?

               INT. CASINO - REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - DAY

               JACK sits in front of REYNOLDS.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         How do you feel, Jack?

                                     JACK
                         Bruised.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Take your time. Two weeks. Three 
                         if you need it. We'll pay you sick 
                         leave. I don't want to lose you. 
                         You're a good man. Here...

               He hands JACK an envelope.

                                     JACK
                         What's this?

               He opens the envelope. Inside is a casino cheque for £500.

                                     REYNOLDS
                              (smiles)
                         Happy New Year. Have a drink on 
                         the company. You've earned it.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               JACK is sitting at his computer, drinking vodka, dressed 
               in his CROUPIER'S suit.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Chapter Thirteen...

               He types... On the SOUNDTRACK we hear the CASINO noise.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         It's all numbers, the croupier 
                         thought. A spin of the wheel. A 
                         turn of a card. The time of your 
                         life. The date of your birth. The 
                         year of your death. In the Book of 
                         Numbers the Lord said: 'thou shalt 
                         count thy steps'.

               There's a ring at the doorbell. He looks at his watch: 
               2.15a.m. The I ring comes again.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack thought, this is it. The famous 
                         two in the morning knock at the 
                         door.  It wad pay-back time.

               JACK goes to the door.

               At the door. It was pay-back time. JACK goes to the door.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         But he wasn't afraid. He hadn't 
                         spent one penny of the ten grand. 
                         He'd covered himself. He knew the 
                         odds.

               JACK calmly opens the door. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN stands 
               there. JACK hadn't expected this.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Mr Manfred?

                                     JACK
                         Yes...

               The sound of the roulette ball bouncing against the numbers.

               INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

               A POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney. The sound of 
               the ball find-ing a number. JACK can hardly bear to look. 
               It is MARION. With emotion...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         What were the odds of being killed 
                         by a car... on New Year's Eve?

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         She was on her way home... to you.

                                     JACK
                         No. She wasn't.

               JACK looks away from MARION'S face. He sees the MAN with 
               the moustache, standing on the other side of the gurney, 
               the MAN he saw with MARION on the street. He is DETECTIVE 
               INSPECTOR ROSS. JACK is disorientated.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Marion had been visiting his 
                         mother...no, no, not his mother - 
                         her mother.

                                     JACK
                              (to Ross)
                         She was visiting her mother. Her 
                         mother.
                              (suddenly)
                         Who are you?

                                     ROSS
                         Detective Inspector Ross.

                                     JACK
                         Who...

                                     ROSS
                         Ross.

                                     JACK
                         Who did it? Tell me!

               He grabs ROSS'S lapels. ROSS carefully removes JACK'S hands.

                                     ROSS
                         We think it's a hit-and-run. A 
                         drunk driver, probably, But there 
                         is a possibility of a revenge 
                         killing.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                              (distraught)
                         Revenge? For what? Whose revenge?

                                     ROSS
                         As you know, she was a WPC with 
                         the Met. up until two years ago.

               JACK fumbles in his pocket for a cigarette. There is a No 
               Smoking sign on the wall. ROSS produces a Zippo and lights 
               JACK'S Gitane.

                                     ROSS
                         She called me last week. She'd got 
                         wind of a planned robbery at your 
                         casino.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         What had that got to do with her 
                         death?

                                     ROSS
                         You didn't recognise the man who 
                         attacked you, did you?

                                     JACK
                              (loudly)
                         Of course I recognised him!

                                     ROSS
                              (surprised)
                         You did?

                                     JACK
                         I know a cheat when I see one. The 
                         man was a cheat.

               ROSS sighs, looks at MARION.

               JACK suddenly reaches down and pulls the white sheet back 
               over MARION'S face.

                                     JACK
                              (to Ross)
                         Do you gamble?

               ROSS is puzzled. JACK drops his cigarette on the floor, 
               grinds it with his shoe. ROSS gives JACK his card.

                                     ROSS
                         If anything occurs to you, call 
                         me.

               JACK walks away from ROSS without a word. The DOCTOR is 
               now filling out a form.

               From the door JACK looks back. ROSS waits for him to say 
               something. JACK doesn't speak.

                                     ROSS
                         I was in love with her, you know.

               There is a REPRISE of JACK covering MARION'S face with the 
               sheet.

               EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

               In his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                              (quoting)
                         'The world breaks everyone, and 
                         afterward many are strong at the 
                         broken places. But those that will 
                         not break, it kills. It kills the 
                         very good and the very gentle and 
                         the very brave impartially. If you 
                         are none of these, you can be sure 
                         it will kill you too but there 
                         will be no special hurry'.

               He passes a poster for the National Lottery bearing the 
               legend: 'IT COULD BE YOU'. JACK doesn't see it.

               INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A WOMAN smashes a plate over a MAN'S head. It's plate-
               smashing party time, Greek-style. TWENTY drunk PEOPLE having 
               fun. Zorba music. Plates are thrown, stamped on, smashed.

               JACK sits alone at a corner table, drinking, watching the 
               fun, unsmiling. One plate cracks into a wall behind him. A 
               MAN stumbles backwards into JACK's table. JACK swiftly 
               moves his drink out of the way. The MAN apologises, turns 
               to JACK. It is MATT.

                                     MATT
                         Jacko! How're you doing?
                              (shakes Jack's hand 
                              vigorously)
                         I heard about the raid. Pity they 
                         didn't pull it off. I wish I'd 
                         been there.

               MATT has to shout above the noise and music. JACK smiles.

                                     JACK
                              (quietly)
                         But you were there Matt.

               MATT doesn't hear.

                                     MATT
                         What? You know what happened to 
                         me, don't you? That bitch Bella 
                         shopped me. I'd like to beat the 
                         shit out of her.

                                     JACK
                         I'd like to buy you a drink.

                                     MATT
                         Cheers. Happy New Year. I really 
                         like you, Jacko, you're so fucking 
                         straight.
                              (suddenly)
                         Hey, you haven't changed your 
                         clothes!

               INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               There are four or five PEOPLE left among the debris. MATT 
               has gone.

               JACK is still there, drunk now.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The music stopped, Jack was drunk... 
                         hallucinating. He was back, as a 
                         child, in the Wild Coast Casino.

               A BLACK WOMAN comes over to him. Her name is LUCY.

                                     LUCY
                         You've been avoiding me.

                                     JACK
                              (blearily)
                         Have I?

                                     LUCY
                         I'm Lucy.

                                     JACK
                         And what do you do, Lucy?

                                     LUCY
                         I'm a witch. A white witch. Why 
                         don't we move on?

                                     JACK
                         Are you going to put a spell on 
                         me?

                                     LUCY
                         I might.

               EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - DAWN

               LUCY guides JACK to a parked car. He is drunker than she. 
               When he sees the car he starts to laugh. It is his Austin 
               Healey.

                                     JACK
                         Nice car. How much did you pay for 
                         it?

                                     LUCY
                         Too much. Eighteen hundred.

               She opens the door for him. They climb in. LUCY starts the 
               car.

                                     LUCY
                         Where to?

                                     JACK
                         Turn left at the lights.

               They drive off.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               A deserted intersection. The Austin Healey swings around a 
               corner.  A WOMAN steps out from the kerb.

               INT. CAR - DAWN

               JACK reacts. He swings the wheel. LUCY shouts. The car 
               swerves, missing the WOMAN.

                                     LUCY
                         Hey! I saw her!

               JACK looks back. The WOMAN is shouting after the car.

                                     LUCY
                         You don't trust women drivers, do 
                         you?

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Jack didn't trust anyone. Except 
                         himself.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN

               JACK sits at his computer. He is watching the printer 
               unloading page after page. JACK assembles the typescript.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         It was finally finished. He thought 
                         of sending it to Giles. But that 
                         wouldn't be right. He would select 
                         a publisher at random, like a 
                         number.

               CLOSE UP: The dedication: 'To Marion'.

               The sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               The ball falls into 10. JACK puts the doll on 10.

               No one at the table has the winning number. JACK sweeps 
               away the losing bets.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               A Blackjack table. The bets are placed. JACK turns over 
               the bank's cards: a KING and an ACE. He takes all the chips 
               from the five PUNTERS.

                                     PUNTER
                              (to Jack)
                         You're wasting yourself. With your 
                         luck you ought to come over to our 
                         side.

               EXT. STREET. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

               JACK comes up to a bookstore window. A sticker reads: 'IT'S 
               A WINNER'. There are quotes blown up from the reviews: "AN 
               INCREDIBLE INSIDE JOB...IT'S ALL HERE, THE SYSTEMS, THE 
               SCAMS, THE SLEAZE...A TALE OF TRIUMPHANT DISGUST...OF 
               EXHILARATING CONTEMPT..." The display is just one book: 
               'I, CROUPIER'. Number 1 Bestseller.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Even his publisher had no idea who 
                         the author was. He had done the 
                         deal through a lawyer. It gave him 
                         a good feeling, no one knowing...

               INT. REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               REYNOLDS is reading the book. He laughs out loud at 
               something.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         ...It never occurred to anyone at 
                         the Casino that the Golden Lion 
                         had been his model. Why should it? 
                         Weren't all casinos the same....

               INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

               JACK is sitting in his croupier's suit on the crowded tube. 
               He sees a WOMAN reading 'I, CROUPIER'. For the first time 
               we see the back cover...'by ANONYMOUS'.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         ...It gave him an exquisite 
                         pleasure, being an underground 
                         man. With all his money, he hadn't 
                         even bought a car. Jack knew the 
                         truth about himself, he was a one-
                         book writer. A one time winner who 
                         had quit while he was ahead...

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN

               Five in the morning.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         He changed nothing in the flat, 
                         bought nothing, spent nothing. The 
                         only thing he did was to remove 
                         the bars outside the window...

               JACK comes in. The phone rings.

               INT. SUN CITY. CASINO - NIGHT

               JANI is holding a mobile phone. In the background is the 
               casino room, the lights, colours, rattling sounds. She 
               waits.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               JACK hesitates, then picks up.

                                     JACK
                         Hello...

                                     JANI
                         Jack! It's Jani.

               The following conversation is INTERCUT.

                                     JACK
                         Jani! Where are you?

                                     JANI
                         Sun City. I've been meaning to 
                         call you for months.

                                     JACK
                              (smiles)
                         How are you?

                                     JANI
                         Great. I'm getting married. At 
                         least, I think I am.

                                     JACK
                         Did you solve your problems?

                                     JANI
                         Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, 
                         hold on a minute. There's someone 
                         here who wants to talk to you...

               JACK waits.

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               A MAN'S hand takes the phone from JANI.

                         Dad!

               JACK SR. his arm round JANI, talks into the phone.

                         I never thanked you properly for 
                         your help. Jani told me you behaved 
                         like a perfect gentleman throughout. 
                         I knew you would. I know my son.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               JACK'S face is a mask, tight, fixed.

                                     JACK SR'S VOICE
                         The woman thinks I'm going to marry 
                         her. But you know me. It's a shame 
                         things didn't work out. But we saw 
                         you all right. You didn't gamble 
                         the ten grand, did you?

                                     JACK
                              (huskily)
                         As a matter of fact I did. But I 
                         won.

                                     JACK SR'S VOICE
                         That's my boy. How's that novel of 
                         yours coming along?

               JACK slowly puts the phone down. He takes a deep breath. 
               Then smiles.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         So that was it. The final card. 
                         Blackjack. His father, eight 
                         thousand miles and twenty seven 
                         years away, was still dealing to 
                         his son Jack from the bottom of 
                         the deck...

                         ...But Jake the croupier had a 
                         sense of humour.

               INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Laughing, JACK pours himself a vodka, raises his glass.

                                     JACK
                         To you. To both of you.

               He drinks at a gulp. He turns. Standing in the doorway is 
               BELLA, wearing a nightdress. She is sleepy.

                                     BELLA
                         What are you laughing at? Who was 
                         that on the phone?

                                     JACK
                         A couple I know are getting married.

               BELLA puts her arms around him lovingly.

                                     BELLA
                         Fools.

               A whistling sound...

               INT. CASINO - NIGHT

               We are back in the FIRST SCENE. The ball bounces around 
               the spinning wheel. The FACES of the PUNTERS. Frozen 
               expressions. They are almost still. We do not see the 
               croupier. Then...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         Now he had reached the point where 
                         he no longer heard the sound of 
                         the ball...

               Nothing moves except the little white ball in the spinning 
               wheel. The ball slows...

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         ...the spin of the wheel had brought 
                         him home to the place where he was 
                         born.

               JACK'S face. A hint of a smile.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The croupier's mission was 
                         accomplished.

               The ball falls into green Zero. JACK rakes all the chips 
               off the table. There are no winners. The film ends on a 

               CLOSE-UP of JACK'S face. A look of calm satisfaction.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         At last he was Master of the Game. 
                         He had aquired the power... to 
                         make you lose.

                                                               FADE OUT:

               THE END

               The Crow : SALVATION

               By

               Chip Johannessen



               OVER BLACKNESS.

               Silence. Broken by the faint clink of precision tools.
               Accurately, patiently wielded.

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               X-CLOSE. A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array
               of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady
               HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.
               Unhurried. Meticulous.

               A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,
               reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny
               feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the
               glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
               CROW. A taxidermy specimen.

               WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light
               of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of
               him. His identity yet to discover.

                                                          SLOW FADE OUT.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               X-WIDE. "THE WALLS" like a medieval castle above a throng
               of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS. A POSTCARD at first, then signs
               of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
               telegraph an imminent execution.

               The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES
               approaches, slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd.

               INSIDE THE BENZ NATHAN RANDALL, father of the victim
               comforts ERIN RANDALL, seventeen year old sister, as she
               looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car,
               the throng between the car and the prison entrance. The
               car stops.

                                     ERIN
                         Why are there so many?

                                     RANDALL
                         Just hold on to me.

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--a Protestor's poster visible.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of LAUREN RANDALL,
               the deceased, who bears a striking resemblance to surviving
               sister Erin. And another sign--"Happy Birthday Alex."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       2.


                                     ERIN
                         It's because they're doing this on
                         his birthday.

               She takes a deep breath, they get out of the car and...

               WITH THE RANDALLS as they make their way through the throng
               toward a special entrance marked "WITNESSES," nearly within
               reach when WHOMP.

               Erin shields her face as a BRIGHT LIGHT comes on. OVER TV
               REPORTER BARBARA GONZALEZ Action Newsteam addressing the
               Nathans. Speaking into a mic.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Mr. Randall. Sir. Do you think
                         this execution will bring you a
                         sense of closure?

               Nathan pushes past Gonzalez, taking Erin's hand.

                                     GONZALEZ (CONT'D)
                         Erin. Your sister...

                                     RANDALL
                         Leave us alone!

               The Reporter TURNS to the camera, not missing a beat.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         A difficult time for everyone
                         involved.
                              (then)
                         Interesting fact. It will take
                         about twenty-one cents of
                         electricity to execute Alex Corvis
                         tonight on this, his twenty-first
                         birthday.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a BIRTHDAY CAKE, twenty one candles flickering as
               it makes its way past deathrow cells, held waiter style on
               one hand by MERCER, a MUSTACHED prison GUARD.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLANG. The barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing
               on a small table next to a CHESS GAME in progress and an
               untouched last meal. ADJUST to find...

               ALEX CORVIS. Twenty-One today. Disarmingly appealing.
               Peaceful. Simple clothes. He looks up from the game, at...

               PETER WALSH, Alex's pro-bono attorney and only friend,
               trying not to explode at this shit-eating stunt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       3.


                                     WALSH
                         He didn't order that.

                                     MERCER
                         We found the man with the scar.

               Despite himself, Alex looks up. Mercer gestures at... THE
               CAKE in the middle of the candles, an arm made of frosting
               with a large ZIGZAG marking on the forearm, also frosting.

               FAVORING ALEX looking from the cake up to Mercer, who nods
               at the candles.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     WALSH
                              (intense whisper)
                         Get it out of here.

               Alex focusses on the chess board. Tries to anyway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               FLASH. The harsh Newsteam video light WHUMPS on,
               illuminating a WRINKLED OLD WOMAN.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Yes, I've come to a lot of these
                         over the years, but this one has
                         many unique aspects. Youth of the
                         condemned. That's unusual. Fifty
                         three stab wounds. Kind of a record.

                                     GONZALEZ'S VOICE
                         And Corvis still maintaining his
                         innocence.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, they all say that.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. A nervous, not to say shifty looking THOMAS "TOMMY"
               LEONARD, thirty five year old key witness in the trial,
               talks to Gonzalez under the hot video light.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't fault him saying I lied on
                         the stand. Facing the chair, you
                         do what you gotta do. But I saw
                         those two fighting that night.

               Tommy shifts uncomfortably, silent as we HOLD a long beat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       4.


                                     TOMMY (CONT'D)
                         I didn't lie.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A Chess piece, a CASTLE, shoved at CAMERA. ADJUST
               to INCLUDE ALEX.

               He breathes deliberately, trying to hold it together. His
               hand shakes as he removes it from the piece.

                                     WALSH
                         You ok?

               Alex gets up, crosses to a small ledge on the other side
               of the cell that holds a few books and pictures. He finds...

               A PICTURE OF LAUREN AND ALEX In a grove of tall trees. A
               self-portrait by autotimer. Arms around each other. Her
               head on his shoulder. Happy.

               RESUME Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         What's been holding me together is
                         the hope that maybe you do go
                         someplace. And I'll be seeing her
                         again soon. Only what will I say?
                         That I was too stupid to find the
                         guy who killed her? That he's down
                         here laughing?

                                     WALSH
                         Tell her... we'll get him.

                                     ALEX
                         We won't.

                                     WALSH
                         Someday he'll surface and I'll get
                         him for both of you. I promise.
                         I'll find the guy with the scar.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. Four UNIFORMED COPS--DUTTON, ERLICH, LARKIN and
               TOOMEY--in the harsh news light.

               Erlich holds a CANE in one hand. Larkin and Toomey are
               twosie monkeys, smoking cigarettes with eerie simultaneity.

                                     ERLICH
                         This mystery man with the scar...
                              (indicates forearm)
                         ...the zigzag, whatever.

               Erlich gives a long-suffering look. Like it's preposterous.
               But he's too gentlemanly to say it.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         We couldn't find him. And,
                         obviously, the jury didn't buy it.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Some people here seem to.

                                     DUTTON
                         People here are protesting the
                         execution of a kid just turning
                         twenty-one. A kid who had a tough
                         life. No parents, no dough. Always
                         had to fight for everything. It's
                         a tragedy, it really is. But I
                         don't see a single sign telling me
                         Alex Corvis is innocent.

               Look around. He's right.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex still gazing at the picture of Lauren. At the board,
               Walsh moves a piece.

                                     MERCER
                         I was facing the hot seat, I'd
                         want my attorney banging down the
                         door of the Supreme Court, not
                         playing board games. But maybe
                         that's just me.

               They look up as Mercer appears outside the barred door to
               the cell, starts to unlock it.

                                     WALSH
                         Your move.

                                     MERCER
                         No. It's time.

               It really is. Other prison personnel arrive outside the
               cell in various uniforms:

               A MINISTER with clerical collar, the WARDEN, two GUARDS.
               Waiting. Walsh crosses, very emotional how. Gives Alex a
               huge hug.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't want you to watch. I don't
                         want to give them the pleasure.

               The two friends exchange a long last look.

                                     MERCER
                         Ok. C'mon now...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       6.


               As Alex exits past Mercer, Walsh sits down on the cot.
               He's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips...

               THE CAKE against the wall where it hits, slides down, still
               semi-intact as it hits the floor.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW

               Dead Man Walking. A mini parade past the cells of the
               condemned. One guard flanks Alex, another follows. The
               Warden and Minister out in front.

               HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes. Unable
               to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity.
               Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side.
               Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW #2 - NIGHT

               The parade continues down another hallway.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The CHAIR, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the
               entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well
               choreographed last dance.

               The Warden gestures, and Alex is escorted to his place in
               the chair. The Guards move in, death attendants now.

                                     MINISTER
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
                         not want...

               THE MINISTER CONTINUES as...

               CLOSE. Handstraps tightened. WHOP. WHOP. Alex squirms
               despite his resolve. Through an act of will, calms himself.
               Looks up at...

               THE PHONE. On the wall. A last possibility of reprise.

               CLOSE. Trouser legs slit. Footstraps tightened around bare
               ankles. Electrodes checked.

               CLOSE. Chest strap tightened. Yanked again for good measure.
               ALEX gasps. It's hard to breathe now with the strap tight
               across his chest.

               CLOSE. Copper mesh. Pieces of sponge jerry-sewn onto it,
               the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural
               appearance.

               ADJUST to REVEAL this is the electrode in the odd leather
               HELMET tightened now on Alex's head.

               THE EXECUTIONER. Pulls a hood over his own obscured face.
               Moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       7.


                                     MINISTER (CONT'D)
                              (concluding)
                         ... and I will dwell in the house
                         of the Lord. Forever.

               SLAP. The Minister shuts his bible. WIDER. Some weird sin.
               Alex strapped into the chair, unable to move.

               The guards exit, jobs done. The Warden nots and...

               ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PLEXI - THE OBSERVATION ROOM REVEALED
               as the CURTAINS OPEN.

               Two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a
               singlewide trailer. Erin. Her father. The Cops. Tommy
               Leonard. Gonzalez and other media types. Prison personnel.
               Every seat occupied. Sweaty and surreal. All looking at
               him. IN THE DEATH CHAMBER The Warden steps forward.

                                     WARDEN
                         Alexander Frederick Corvis. Do you
                         have any last words?

               A thick silence. Alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans
               a sea of hostile faces, settling on Erin and her dad.

                                     ALEX
                         I loved Lauren. I still do. I'm
                         innocent.

               Erin shakes her head, disgusted. Looks away.

               ALEX'S POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his
               inner perception, movement ramping down as Alex scans the
               disbelieving faces.

               The Phone. Silent. No reprise. The Observation Room witness
               door opens. A Guard in the back row deferentially offers
               his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL, a man in dark clothes, his
               face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass. As he
               UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff...

               The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the
               executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch.

               The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm,
               exposing a scar for Alex, THE SCAR, an odd zigzag pattern
               of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin.

               The Executioner throws the switch. ON ALEX SHAKING violently
               as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now
               as he chokes out...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (indistinct, filtered)
                         Murderer!

               The word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to
               Alex. Alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will
               trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       8.


               THE HELMET starts to smoke. Then a burst of FLAME at Alex's
               head.

               A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alex's struggle to see,
               to stay alive.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic, horrified.
               Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his
               shirt. Face always obscured.

               IN THE DEATH CHAMBER Alex in electro-spasm, smoke filling
               the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull
               the curtain closed.

               It JAMS partway across. ALEX expires in the char,
               grotesquely burned, EYES OPEN as the Warden finally yanks
               the curtain closed.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The Scar Man slips out, but the
               rest remain, transfixed, horrified. Erin and others in
               tears. HOLD a long beat, their GASPS faintly audible.
               Then...

                                     MERCER
                         Cruel, who's to say, but it sure
                         was unusual.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Two guards push a gurney down a reverberant hallway far
               from the in-your-face security of deathrow.

                                     GUARD ONE
                         Look at this. Goddamn helmet melted
                         down.

                                     MERCER
                         That, my friend, is a deterrent.

               They WIPE past, Alex's charred remains visible a moment,
               parts of the helmet fused on his face and head, his body
               convulsed in a pugilistic attitude.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               The guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker,
               one of several. Mercer opens the locker door. The
               unceremoniously slide the body into the locker and...

               BANG. The body hits the open door. Convulsed as it is, the
               body won't really fit through the door.

                                     MERCER
                         Whoops.

               CRUNCH. The sound of something breaking as the SHOVE Alex
               into the cubby hole.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       9.


                                     GUARD ONE
                         Why do they even autopsy these
                         guys? Cause of death is pretty
                         fucking obvious.

               FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER. The door slams shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE on the PICTURE of Alex and Lauren.

               ADJUST to include Walsh, looking at it. Pained. Still trying
               to understand. He secures it to the lid of the case already
               containing the neatly packed chess set. Closes it. Bows
               his head.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               The protestors are gone, as is the Newsteam, but the four
               Cops are still there, Larkin and Toomey synchro-smoking.

               They look up as the Randalls emerge shaken from the Witness
               entrance.

               FAVORING NATHAN RANDALL He speaks softly to Erin, who's
               leaning against him.

                                     RANDALL
                              (to Erin)
                         I'll meet you atthe car, honey.

               She continues on and Randall crosses to the cops, who wait
               patiently to see what he'll say. Finally...

                                     DUTTON
                         We all wish this had ended better.
                         Sir.

               Randall nods. Like that's all anyone could say. As he walks
               off the Cops fall into easy chatter. CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CLOSE. A face slides into frame in PROFILE, too tight to
               be recognizable.

               Just an eye, peering...

               EYE'S POV - THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS A coarse ZIGZAG
               stitch shaped like the Scar runs the length of the Crow's
               underbelly. The end stitch now tied with a tiny knot.

               Tightened just so. THE MYSTERY MAN features obscured still,
               grabs a bent surgical SCISSORS, snips the excess thread.
               Smoothes black feathers into place, hiding the stitching
               on...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      10.


               THE CROW Finished. The Man gets up, leaves.

               CAMERA PUSHING on the Bird's head as we HEAR a door shut,
               still PUSHING on the glass eye that BLINKS now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE LOCKER. A human EYE BLINKS. Barely visible in
               the darkness. Alex KICKS with a YELL and...

               IN THE MORGUE.  The locker door flies open and Alex spills
               onto the floor. Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees
               before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive
               response. He cowers, looks up at...

               A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window,
               lands near him on the floor. It looks at him, then flaps
               its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. Follow
               me.

               ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought
               him here.

               HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in
               front of a mirror over the splash sink. It flies off,
               revealing Alex's reflection. Charred. Hideous.

               ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM. Turns, sees
               himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist...

               THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word "MORGUE," painted on
               the wall behind Alex, brought into focus at the center of
               the concavity. ALEX thrashes, trying to avoid his
               reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded.

               THE CROW flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. CAWING
               loudly, finally getting Alex's attention. ALEX settles,
               hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel.

               His body looks less misshapen now. He looks at his arms,
               hands, no longer burned. Pulls himself up on the gurney
               again, cautiously.

               OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second
               time, looks in the mirror. His body miraculously HEALED,
               covered by shredded clothing.

               His face obscured by the meltdown helmet. He slowly
               approaches the mirror on unsteady feet.

                                     ALEX
                              (to his own
                              reflection)
                         What happened?

               Alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first
               frightening FLASH as his fingers touch it...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      11.


               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - FLASHBACK A blitz return to his own
               execution. The copper screen, the helmet lowered into place.
               Electro-spasm. The faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen
               darkly.

               RESUME -ALEX clutching the helmet on his head, ripping it
               off in one painful OVERCRANKED movement and...

               OVER ALEX, IN THE MIRROR It's Alex, and yet not. His face
               marked with the Crow MASK, jagged WARPAINT where the melted
               helmet ran down his face. An indelible reminder of the
               botched execution. he stares at himself for a couple of
               deep breaths. Then WHAM! Shatters the mirror with a martial
               punch.

               THE FRACTURED MIRROR Alex's mask reflected in shards as
               his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass. His
               purpose unclear.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The Crow hops out into the hallway, flies toward us, lands
               with a CAW as Alex enters the hallway, framed against hight
               walls. His tentative movements growing more assured.

                                     ALEX
                         Follow the leader.

               The Crow flies off and Alex follows, to... A DOOR marked
               "No Unauthorized Entry." As they pass through...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a MONITOR, a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. A small
               red light FLASHES. The GUARD keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD
                         We've got unauthorized movement in

               WITH the LEGS of a Guard walking quickly. REVEAL Mercer.
               His RADIO crackling.

                                     MERCER
                              (into radio)
                         Mercer. I'm on it.

               He passes through the "No Unauthorized Entry" door into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - "B-5" HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Empty. Bars at the far end spell seriously secure territory.
               Mercer moves cautiously up the empty hallway, stops as...
               The Crow hops out from a side hallway. Drawing him on.

                                     MERCER
                              (into radio)
                         Found our intruder. It's got a
                         beak and a death wish.

               Mercer pulls out his NIGHTSTICK, loses the bird as it hops
               back THROUGH BARS into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex looks around his now empty cell. On the wall is a
               rectangle, clearer than the wall around it, where the
               photograph of Alex and Lauren had been before Walsh removed
               it. Alex goes up to thewall and touches the spot.

               FLASH! ALEX'S INTERNAL POV FLASH of LAUREN, laughing as
               she beckons to someone, Alex, who joins her in frame as we
               hear the whir of the camera auto-timer. A click, as the
               picture is taken. Alex and Lauren are frozen in the pose
               of Alex's photograph.

               RESUME The picture is gone. Alex, perplexed, stands looking
               at the blank spot on the wall for a moment. He turns and
               exits the cell...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               Mercer is peering through the double-barred gate at the
               end of the row as Alex emerges from his former cell.

                                     MERCER
                              (still into radio)
                         Get me some backup. We got one
                         loose on the row.
                              (through the bars
                              to Alex)
                         Now who the fuck are you?

               Alex looks up, sees Mercer and FLASH...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A pop of Mercer bringing the birthday
               cake. A wash of flame, twenty one candles. A blip of Walsh.
               Of a White King.

               RESUME Alex perplexed, looking at the cake still littering
               the floor of his ex-cell, candles melted down. Mercer works
               his way through the double-barred doors onto the row.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         And what have you done to your
                         face there beauty queen?

               The INMATE occupying the cell next to Alex's peers out
               through the bars, vanishes again as Mercer WHOPS the bars
               once with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX
                         It's my birthday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      13.


                                     MERCER
                         Yeah, well... here's a present for
                         you.

               WHOOSH. Mercer swings his NIGHTSTICK at Alex's head. Alex
               catches it, instinctively in one hand. Mercer reaches for...

               A RED PANIC BUTTON hanging off his guard belt. Mercer slams
               it. FAVORING ALEX lets go of the stick, looks at his own
               hand, surprised.

               WHAM!  Mercer broadsides Alex's head with the stick. Alex
               goes down shocked, not from pain, from the fact that someone
               would attack him.

               WHAM WHAM WHAM. Mercer brutalizes Alex, collapsed at his
               feet as... TWO GUARDS enter the far end of the Row, race
               toward Alex's cell, one holding a TASER. Its LASER SIGHT
               finds Alex, crumpled in front of Mercer.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         It's ok. Man. Had me going there.

               Looks like it's over. The guards relax. ALEX suddenly looks
               up at Mercer. Zero damage from the blows.

                                     ALEX
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     MERCER
                         Taser!

               Alex wheels around as Guard One squeezes the trigger.
               CROWVISION The Taser Darts speed toward Camera.

               RESUME Alex shunts himself to the side and the TASER DARTS
               impale themselves in Mercer's thighs. He drops fibrillating.

               A CHEER goes up from the men in their cells, who become
               progressively rowdier as the guards BOLT and Alex follows,
               strength in his stride, nightstick in hand.

               Pieces of FLAMING TOILETPAPER flung now from the cells of
               Deathrow.

               AT THE FAR ENTRANCE the two Guards scramble to get the
               door closed behind them before Alex catches up. They'd
               make it except Alex hurls...

               THE NIGHTSTICK flying end over end like a throwing knife,
               catching the trailing guard in the back of the head,
               dropping him in the door, propping it open.

               ALEX enters the cage entrance to Deathrow, sharing the
               space with the Guard still standing.

                                     ALEX
                              (pats pockets, then)
                         Keys?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      14.


               The frightened Guard opens the door into the next hallway
               and bolts. Leaving the keys. The Crow hopping, screaming...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. Lit up like a
               Christmas tree now with flashing red lights. The Guard
               keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD
                         Unauthorized movement in B five, B
                         six, C three, four, five...

               Another LIGHT goes on. They're starting to make a line.
               Buzzers going off now. A general ALARM sounded.

                                     RADIO GUARD (CONT'D)
                         Escape in progress. Heading for
                         the roof.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               The Crow flaps up the stairwell. Alex on its heels, taking
               steps three at a time.

               AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL The Crow waits on a LANDING
               with a door marked "Emergency Use Only." Plus a dozen lines
               of assorted instructions. Guards' feet THUNDER below,
               approaching.

                                     ALEX
                         I hear the pitter patter of little
                         feet.

               He opens the door. The ALARM is LOUD.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Dark a moment. Then a HUGE SPOTLIGHT hits Alex, casting
               long shadows. He looks up at a GUARD TOWER, the source of
               the light. And of a BULLHORN VOICE.

                                     BULLHORN VOICE
                         Do not proceed. Back slowly away
                         from the fence.

               As if in defiance, the Crow hops toward the fence, old
               chain link topped with razorwire along the perimeter of
               the roof.

               BULLHORN VOICE CONTINUES as Alex follows... ALEX'S POV
               through the fence, down fifty feet to the pavement.

                                     ALEX
                         Damn.

               Alex turns, sees... A HALF DOZEN GUARDS emerge from the
               stairwell to the top of the roof, level weapons at Alex.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      15.


               ON THE FENCE - ALEX climbs quickly to the top, where he
               grabs two painful handfuls of razorwire that cut deeply
               into this hand. He extricates himself, balancing atop the
               fence. And looks...

               ALEX'S HANDS The jagged bloodlines disappear, miraculously
               heal.

               FAVORING ALEX as he holds up his hands to show the guards,
               a kid-like smile on his face.

               They respond by raising their weapons and BAM BAM BAM.

               Alex hurls himself off the edge in a hail of Gunfire that
               Dopplers down to silence as he falls, falls...

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Alex hits, flushing PIGEONS,
               that fill frame with manic wings.

               As the SPOTLIGHT sweeps toward Alex he rolls off, over the
               sidewalk, between two parked cars.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               ON THE ROOFTOP Mercer and the others stand there dumbstruck,
               looking down as the SPOTLIGHT finds nothing.

               A RADIO CRACKLES. Mercer keys it a beat later.

                                     RADIO GUARD VOICE
                         Physical head count shows all
                         inmates present.

               Mercer moves the radio away from his head.

                                     MERCER
                         Then who was the fucking Houdini?

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Illuminated by spill from the
               Spotlight, Alex crouches between two cars. He leans forward,
               checking his reflection in a CHROME HUBCAP. A huge smile
               spreads over his face.

                                     ALEX
                         Happy birthday.

               He laughs. Life--or whatever this is--is good. So far.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The CROW flies past tall buildings downtown.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      16.


               EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               The crow flies past letters P-O-L-I-C-E on the side of an
               older building taking us to...

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               SMASH. A hand punches through a sash window, right through
               the imbedded security wires, roughly rips off the latch
               inside. Retracts, bleeding. The window opens.

               It's Alex, on the fire escape, checking out his arm as the
               BLEEDING STOPS.

               Alex follows the Crow into the dark room packed with file
               cabinets and evidence bins, wire lockers. And a desk, strewn
               with POLICE FORMS. Plus a vertical SPIKE with processed
               evidence request FORMS impaled on it.

                                     ALEX
                              (checking out desk)
                         Police? Evidence?
                              (then, to Crow)
                         Look. I like what we've got going
                         here. But I can think of lots better
                         to do with it than fighting crime.
                         Know what I mean?

               The Crow makes its way to a file cabinet, the top drawer
               marked "Cl-Cr."  Alex lingers a moment at the desk, eye on
               the spike.

               WHOP. Alex drives his hand onto the SPIKE. Looks up,
               delighted. CAW.

               The Crow gives Alex an admonishing look. Alex pulls the
               spike from his hand. Instant healing.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ok, ok... what?

               Alex opens the top drawer. Looking for... he's not sure
               what. Glibly goes through folders.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Nothing under "Crow."

               He stops. Pulls out the first FILE out in a thick section
               marked "CORVIS, ALEXANDER F." Having caught a glimpse of...

               IN THE FILE - ALEX'S MUG SHOT And rap sheet. X-CLOSE. We
               see "Murder 1st degree," "Penalty Phase: Find for
               Execution."

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Execution?

               But even this has little interest for him as the finds the
               words "Lauren Randall" on the page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      17.


                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (remembering)
                         Lauren...

               ALEX rips the drawer out of the file cabinet, dumps it
               CRASHING on the ground. He drops to the floor with a growing
               sense of dread, feeling with both hands, finding...

               A SPLAY OF PHTOGRAPHS encased in plastic -- the
               prosecutions' background presentation on Alex and Lauren.
               The first photo shows LAUREN Posing jauntily, her arm around
               a Snowman. She and the Snowman wear matching Boston Red
               Sox caps.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV On Alex, anticipating...WHAP!  A
               snowball nails him square in the face.

               WIDE to reveal LAUREN running for cover as Young Alex scoops
               up snow for ammo. He lobs a snowball at Lauren, just as
               she slips to the ground. she doesn't get up right away.

               Alex is just a shade concernec as he runs over to her. He
               reaches the spot to find LAUREN in the snow, waving her
               arms and legs to make a snow angel. She looks up at him
               and beckons him to lie on top of her.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What are you, an Angel?

                                     LAUREN
                         I'm your Angel. Come here.

               RESUME Alex's pained smile at the memory, until he finds:
               THE MURDER WEAPON A rough looking hunting knife bagged and
               tagged as "AC-005: Murder Weapon."

               ALEX frantic now, spreading out the file contents,

                         No! I didn't...!

               Alex SMASHES his own head against the metal file cabinets,
               wounding himself on the handles, droplets of blood flying
               now, spattering the evidence on the floor.

               the witness stand. The knife held up for him by an unseen
               lawyer.

                                     TOMMY
                         His knife. Corvis.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         You lie!

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               RESUME Alex shakes his head "no." Incredulous, horrified.
               The fury abating with a growing sense of mission.

                                     ALEX
                         You lie, you lie, you lie...

               Alex fishing through the detritus around him, finding...
               "THE LIST" A list of witnesses by category with contact
               numbers, addresses. Alex's finger finds Eyewitness Thomas
               Leonard.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Thomas Leonard.

               THE DOOR TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM opens.

               A YOUNG COP enters, walks slowly past rows of file cabinets,
               looking down empty aisles until finding the file drawerful
               Alex dumped. But Alex is gone.

               The Young Cop looks up as the Crow departs through the
               window and two other cops arrive. One of them Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         What the hell was that?
                              (then seeing mess)
                         Shit.

               Dutton walks to the mess on the floor, curious. He squats.
               Picks up a tag marked "Murder Weapon AC-005" staples ripped
               out, nothing attached to it. Takes in the crime scene photos
               of Lauren. Off the PIX...

               EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

               CAMERA DRIFTS down through dark trees FINDING Alex at a
               grave beneath a sheltering tree.

                                     ALEX
                         I thought I'd be with you now.

               He's kneeling in front of a HEADSTONE. "Lauren Randall
               1982-2000. Always With Us."

               The Crow perched nearby. Camera circles Alex who looks up
               as the headstone WIPES through frame and...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV LAUREN NATHAN, a compelling sixteen
               year old, circles making an oddly sexy version of the "Oooo"
               Bruce Lee sound. A goof, a game she's playing with Alex,
               who circles opposite.

                                     LAUREN

                         Your Shaolin style is no match for
                         my kung fu.

               As Alex wipes by...

               RESUME Camera continues to circle Alex at the grave.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm not dead. And I'm not alive.
                         And I'm remembering. And it hurts.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV More goof kung fu, the circle closing.
               Lauren laughing more, searching for words.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your... flying crane style is no
                         match for my... drunken tiger kick.

               RESUME Resolve strengthening.

                                     ALEX
                         I can't be alive. Not without you.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren's starting to crack up, trying
               to think of what comes next.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your... mad monkey... love ... is
                         no match for...

               They look at each other a long moment. As they kiss...

               RESUME

                                     ALEX
                         I want to be with you forever.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren in his arms as the kiss ends,
               and she answers a question we never heard.

                                     LAUREN
                         Only forever?

               RESUME OVER THE CROW. Camera stops circling. Alex looks up
               at the headstone, silent tears in his eyes as...

                                     ALEX
                         What happened to us?

               A SINGLE BLOOD RED TEAR rolls down the cheek of the angel
               atop the headstone. Alex stops it with his finter.

               WIDER, the supplicant at the grave. And the Crow nearby.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MERCEDES - TRAVELLING - NIGHT - RAIN

               A GIRL'S HAND clutches a HEART SHAPED LOCKET.

               TILT UP, it's Erin, wearing an identical LOCKET around her
               neck. School uniform, pleated skirt and school books. The
               splish splash of the wipers the only sound until...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad...

               Nathan looks over. Sees she's holding the Locket.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I want to take this to Lauren.
                         She'd want it.

                                     RANDALL
                         Honey. I just can't.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay in the car. I'll only take a
                         second.

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin. I know you think she's been
                         talking to you.

                                     ERIN
                         It's not that. Really. It's just...
                         now that he's gone, I think it's
                         time.

               Off her dad...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT - RAIN

               The Benz stops on the roadway beneath Lauren's grave. The
               door opens...

               ERIN gets out in the pouring rain pulling her jacket HOOD
               up over her head. Locket in hand she runs to...

               LAUREN'S GRAVE The tree a shelter from the downpour.  Erin's
               approaching the headstone when Alex emerges from behind
               the trunk. Drenched. She YELPS.

                                     ALEX
                         It's ok. I'm not going to hurt
                         you.

                                     ERIN
                         Don't come near me!

               He holds his hands up, compliant. She doesn't bolt. But
               she's ultra-cautious. Like with a snarling dog.

                                     ALEX
                         I was a friend of your sister's.

                                     ERIN
                         I know her friends.

                                     ALEX
                         That locket you're holding. You
                         have one just like it.

               She lifts the Locket around her neck. Visible to anyone.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, no kidding.

                                     ALEX
                         Your father gave them to both of
                         you.

                                     ERIN
                         And he's right over there by the
                         way.
                              (then)
                         What did you do to your face?

                                     ALEX
                         Someone else did it.

                                     ERIN
                         You're a friend of the guy who
                         killed her, aren't you? You almost
                         sound like him.

                                     ALEX
                         He didn't kill her.

                                     ERIN
                         How do you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I know everything about your sister.
                         I'll prove it to you.

                                     ERIN
                              (loud now)
                         Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!

               OS, the car door opens. Then SLAMS shut. Nathan approaches.

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin!

                                     ERIN
                         Watch out!

               She whips around, points at... Alex is gone.

                                     RANDALL
                         What were you yelling about?

                                     ERIN
                         This guy said he was a friend of
                         Lauren's. He had like paint all
                         over his face.

                                     RANDALL
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         What's that supposed to mean? He
                         was right here. He was!

               She shakes her head, confused, then, looking around spots...

               THE HEADSTONE. The track from the RED TEAR indelible even
               in the downpour.

               Off Erin, as she touches the angel's stained cheek. And
               her dad, soggy in the rain...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - RAIN - NIGHT

               A street LIGHT flickers on. Maybe because night has fallen
               or maybe its just a rainy day.

               Thomas Leonard hikes up his collar, trying to stay dry, as
               he pauses a clutch of hookers huddled in a doorway...

                                     HOOKER
                         Yo, Tommy. Red light special.

                         Even you can afford it.

               He shakes his head--don't need that grief--continues on to
               the next building and CAMERA FINDS...

               ALEX watching, holding "The List." He crosses off the name
               for Eyewitness "Thomas Leonard."

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Tommy clears the stairs, heads for his door. Unlocking the
               second lock, he looks around, alert, like he heard
               something. Then opens the door.

               INT. TENEMENT - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Alex waits for Tommy, crouched by an OPEN WINDOW that looks
               out onto an alley, a four story drop.

                                     TOMMY

                         Sssshhh. She's resting.

                         Where the fuck did you come from?

                         Big bang, primordial ooze, divine
                         hand of a benevolent creator?  All
                         possibilities. Although recent
                         events have given me doubts about
                         the benevolent creator.

               Tommy starts toward Alex, who pulls the KNIFE from the
               Evidence Room.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You lied at my trial.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't know you, man.

               WHAM. Alex pins what looks like Tommy's arm. It's just his
               jacket, but it immobilizes Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids
                         arguing. A guy and a girl.

                                     ALEX
                         You said you saw me with this. I
                         never held it until today.

                         hacked up that girl like a

               Alex HEAVES Tommy crashing into the window, smashing the
               glass and cheap aluminum frame.

               Tommy hanging halfway in, halfway out. Four floors above
               the alley. Alex rips Tommy's shirt where the knife already
               cut it. JACKS the sleeve down. No scar there.

                                     ALEX
                         One chance to tell the truth, Tommy.
                         Who is the man with the scar? He
                         planted this in my car.

                                     TOMMY
                         There's no scar. Corvis made it
                         up.

                                     ALEX
                         Wrong. Answer.

                                     TOMMY
                         Who are you?

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Tommy!

               TOMMY'S WIFE enters from the bedroom, SCREAMING.

               Heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. OS, a
               TODDLER CRIES as she throws herself on Alex and they spill
               back inside.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE (CONT'D)
                         Let him go! Let him go!

                                     TOMMY
                         Honey. Take the baby. Get out of
                         here now!

               But she doesn't leave. She pleads in wrenching SOBS that
               seem to affect Alex. The Crow lands in the window.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         He's all I got. Tommy and the baby.
                         Don't take him. The baby needs a
                         father.

               Her MASCARA runs down her cheeks, a facsimile of Alex's
               mask. They share a long look, connected by pain.

               The Crow cawing a warning, hopping in the window as...

                                     ALEX
                         Your baby is crying. Go.

               Tommy nods at his wife, who heads off to the bedroom. The
               Crow gives Alex an admonishing CAW, then takes flight.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         They showed me pictures, what he
                         did to her. Evidence. Said all I
                         had to do was stand up there and
                         not my head "yes."

                                     ALEX
                              (repeats, insistent)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         A job. Construction. Twelve an
                         hour.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      25.


               Tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old BOY.
               Alex unfolds "The List," passes it to Tommy, blank side
               up.

                                     ALEX
                         Write down their names. All of
                         them.

               But Tommy takes a look at "The List" and flips it over...

               "THE LIST" Tommy points to the Police Witness list. Dutton,
               Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

                                     TOMMY
                         You already got 'em. Right here.
                         These cops said the needed an
                         eyewitness, or Corvis would walk.

               ALEX drops his head. All clear now. He laughes gently at
               the sound of SIRENS approaching, still blocks away.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the by now familiar Mystery Man, bent
               over his work at the table across the room.

               CLOSE. A lineup of short (2") rods. One selected with a
               pair of surgical forceps,

               INSERTED through a hole in human flesh, raising a
               considerable welt. Some bleeding.

               As the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty
               STAND among the taxidermy specimens. Marked "Corvus
               brachyrhynchos."

               He scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands,
               shielding his face as a Crow flies out of the darkness,
               right at him.

               The man turns toward Camera but we never see his face as
               the Crow wheels mid-air, flying past him a second time. As
               the Crow flies up and out a SMALL WINDOW, the man stands,
               hands on the desk. SLOW PUSH on the man, on...

               A ZIGZAG PATTERN of raised welts on the underside of his
               forearm, in high relief under the Draftsman's lamp.

               The "Scar." A drop of blood zigzags, running downward.
               SLOW FADE OUT. OVER BLACK, the CRACKLE of a Police Radio.
               We're...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. A police CRUISER has stopped a late model
               CADILLAC SEVILLE on a deserted street.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      26.


               IN THE POLICE CAR CLOSE. COP I.D. "Dutton, Philip" with a
               picture of the same face CAMERA FINDS working a bad comb-
               over in the rearview mirror.

               IN THE SEVILLE TRACY, almost sixteen, dressed for nightlife,
               sees Dutton primping in her rearview mirror. He's getting
               out now.

                                     TRACY
                         Oh no...

               She jostles her friend JANNIE, passed out in the front
               passenger seat, trying to rouse her. No luck. DUTTON motions
               and Tracy buzzes down the window.

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                         Anything wrong?

                                     DUTTON
                         Let's hope not. License and
                         registration please.

               Tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks
               through her purse. Not finding anything.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         What's with your friend there?

                                     TRACY
                         She's... sick.
                              (off Dutton)
                         Actually she never had Mai Tais
                         before.

                                     DUTTON
                         But you, you've had them.

                                     TRACY
                         Not tonight. Honest.

               Tracy paws through her purse some more. Vamping.

                                     DUTTON
                         If you had a license, I bet I'd
                         have seen it by now. How old are
                         you? Fifteen?

                                     TRACY
                         Look, I'll tell you the truth.
                         Jannie drove us and was supposed
                         to drive us back, she has a license,
                         but I mean... look at her.

               Dutton leaves that dangling. Circles around to the passenger
               side...

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                              (whisper to Jannie)
                         Get up, get up...!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      27.


               Dutton opens Jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between
               her slightly parted legs. Dutton smiles at Tracy.

                                     DUTTON
                         Why don't you get out.

               CROWVISION High overhead. Tracy steps out of the car. Dutton
               shuts the passenger door, points. Tracy moves behind the
               Seville.

               RESUME Dutton closes in. She's getting very nervous.

                                     TRACY
                         You want me to walk a straight
                         line?

                                     DUTTON
                         I want you... to bend over.

                                     TRACY
                         Look, can I just call a cab?

                                     DUTTON
                         What did I say?

               Tracy bends over the car trunk. Dutton eases her feet apart
               with the tip of his boot then pulls out his NIGHTSTICK,
               uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt. As
               he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no."

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Maybe I'll ask your friend.

               Tracy's frantic, about to call out as Dutton moves to the
               passenger door, opens it and...

               OVER DUTTON - ALEX sits in the passenger seat now. Jannie
               shunted inward.

                                     ALEX
                              (mimicking Dutton)
                         I want you... to bend over. Officer
                         Dutton.

               Dutton pulls his 9MM BARETTA on Alex.

                                     DUTTON
                         Where'd you come from? Out of the
                         car. Now!

               With insolent slowness, Alex finishes writing...

               "THE LIST" a red line drawn through Dutton's name.

               ALEX gets out of the car. Dutton SLAMS the door and Janie
               stirs, coming to. At least a bit.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Hands on the car.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      28.


                                     ALEX
                         Question. These hands?

               Alex advances on Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         You're dead, ditch weed.

               CLOSE. Dutton's finger squeezes the trigger.

               BAM! The shot blows Alex back at the Seville passenger
               window. Slumped face against the car.

                                     TRACY
                         Omigod, omigod...

               Jannie's head pops up inside the car. She SCREAMS at...

               JANNIE'S POV Alex right in her face, nice and dead. Dutton
               lowers his gun BG. Tracy in a panic. Suddenly, Alex opens
               his eyes, smiles.

               Face distorted against the glass. She screams again.

                                     ALEX
                         You're up.

               ALEX wheels around, wrenches Dutton's wrist, vise gripped.
               Dutton's gun falls to the ground.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ladies. Drive carefully.

               Tracy rushes to the driver side.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You might want to call 911. Report
                         an officer down.

               Tracy SCREECHES off leaving Dutton in shock.

                                     DUTTON
                         That was a fucking hollow point!

                                     ALEX
                         I guess it's true. Guns don't kill
                         people...

               Alex draws the KNIFE--the murder weapon--from his costume.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think maybe knives do?

                                     DUTTON
                         Keep that thing away from me.

                                     ALEX
                         This is not just some "thing."
                         It's A C zero zero five.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      29.


                                     DUTTON
                         You're the skel broke into the
                         evidence room.

               FLASH. The knife moves and RIP! Alex yanks the sleeve off
               Dutton's uniform, revealing a SCARLESS FOREARM.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Fuck! What do you want?

                                     ALEX
                         A scar. On the arm. Of the man who
                         planted this in Alex Corvis's car.

                                     DUTTON
                         There's no scar, you freak. The
                         Corvis kid made it up.

               Alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then RAMS Dutton
               into a wall with a great CLATTER of trash cans.

               Alex all over him, holding Dutton's head firmly in his two
               hands, like he could crush it in an instant.

                                     ALEX
                         He was innocent. You framed him.
                         You. And Erlich. And Larkin. And
                         Toomey. What do you think, Officer
                         Dutton? An eye for an eye?

               Alex's thumbs inch toward Dutton's eyes, grazing Dutton's
               eyelids now and a wild thing happens.

               FLASH!  ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Dutton's Nightstick lifts
               Lauren's skirt.

               Then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, Lauren's death. And
               the surprise BAM! of a shot fired.

               RESUME Alex thrown by this. Relaxes his grip on Dutton.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You were there. All four of you.

               Dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over Alex's
               back then pulls a SMALL SEMI-AUTO from an ankle holster.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You killed her. I saw it.

                                     DUTTON
                         Bitch killed herself when she shot
                         a cop in the leg. If she' just
                         acted like a girl nothing would
                         have happened.
                              (then)
                         So you're right, spooky. Happy?

               BAM! Alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, Dutton
               starting to panic. BAM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      30.


               Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. Pointed right at
               his face, then...

               WHOOSH. Alex flips it around, RAMS the gun in Dutton's
               mouth. He couldn't talk if he wanted to.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm working on it.

               BAM! We HEAR the blast as we... CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               BAM BAM continues, but these are TOY GUNS, fired in synch
               with POUNDING MUSIC.

               In the hands of TWO STRIPPERS. Topless, leather G's and
               chokers, black stockings, POLICE HATS on their heads, law
               enforcement stars for earrings.

               The CAPACITY CROWD responds as they pout, wield their
               weapons.

               AT THE ENTRANCE - MADDEN a straightfaced plainclothes
               detective, more upscale than the clientele, flashes a BADGE
               at a BOUNCER who scowls, lets him pass.

               WITH MADDEN circumnavigating the mainstage, where the cop-
               strippers are waving handcuffs now. At the edge of the
               room, LAP-DANCERS pull one-on-one's for twenties. Madden
               exits...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               BACKSTAGE Madden moves past girls in various stages of
               undress. Smoking, yapping, waiting to go onstage. One looks
               up, interested, but he doesn't look back, exits into...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               AN INTERNET PORN FACILITY Where "live" sex workers man
               tiny fantasy sets--a Dungeon, a Shower, a desk and
               blackboard meant to suggest a Schoolroom. Crudely built,
               but good enough for 500x800 pixel resolution. Madden stops
               a second, looking...

               OVER A MONITOR - THE DUNGEON SET UPDATES every six seconds,
               the slowly changing low-rez version of the action on the
               set--a woman tied to a chair with bright surgical tubing.

               The picture refreshes and BG, the woman sneaks an expertly
               timed sip of Diet Coke, puts the can away before the picture
               updates again.

               A COUNTER shows 132,768 hits and climbing. Madden gives a
               look, like people are really fucked up, continues past a
               curtain with a "No Admittance" sign into...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      31.


               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               A BACK HALL dark, the furthest recesses of the building.
               Madden continues cautiously toward... A DOOR

               INT. THE HOLE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door is cracked open. Madden moving very quietly now,
               scowling as he peers through the slight opening.

               Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money.
               Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach.

               The door flies open.

                                     MADDEN
                         Police!

               A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze.
               Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.

                                     ERLICH
                         You fuck. Don't do that.

               It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey. Three cops we met at the
               execution. Erlich's cane nearby.

                                     MADDEN
                         How's the month end?

                                     ERLICH
                         Oh yes. Never been better.

                                     MADDEN
                         Where's Dutton?

                                     ERLICH
                         Probably parked near some high
                         school with a hardon. Fuck never
                         showed.

                                     MADDEN
                         Anyone at all curious why?

               Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look. Madden goes to
               one of the money counters and grabs...

               A STACK OF TWENTIES tossed violently at the ceiling.

               Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like
               leaves, picking them up.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         You leave the door open with two
                         hundred strangers out there!  What's
                         it take for you guys to learn a
                         goddamn lesson?

                                     TOOMEY
                         No one saw anything, Mad.

                                     MADDEN
                         You know why Dutton's not here?
                         Rigor mortis! He's dead.

               The Three exchange looks.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         One shot to the head, then fifty
                         three stab wounds with a six inch
                         blade. Any deja vu here? Think
                         Corvus knife, missing from the
                         evidence room.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Since when?

                                     MADDEN
                         Since last night. As usual, you're
                         right on top of things.

                                     LARKIN
                         It was supposed to end when Corvis
                         died. Remember? The kid no one
                         would miss?

                                     ERLICH
                         Don't look at me, asshole.

                                     LARKIN
                         Hey, I didn't kill anybody.

                                     ERLICH
                         Back off. I mean it.

                                     MADDEN
                         Shut up! Erlich and Larkin settle
                         down.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck.
                         Every reporter in town's trying to
                         get a look at Dutton's body. I
                         suggest we get a line on this before
                         someone else does.

                                     LARKIN
                         Who'd give a shit about Corvis at
                         this point? Kid didn't have a friend
                         in the world even when he was alive.

                                     ERLICH
                         I can think of one.

               Erlich and Madden share a look. On the same wavelength.
               Erlich picks up his weapon off the table.

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               A large CRIME SCENE marked off by tape, Dutton's cruiser
               where he left it. Several other cruisers nearby, lights
               flashing. An ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now.

               AN ACTION NEWSTEAM the one we've seen before, Barbara
               Gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for
               us to hear.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a TV. Gonzalez audible now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         ... rumors multiply as officials
                         refuse to confirm or deny reports
                         of multiple, multiple stab wounds...

               Gonzalez CONTINUES UNDER as...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad! Come in here!

               The SOUND of footsteps racing down the hall.

                                     RANDALL
                         What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         The cop who found the knife in
                         Corvis's car.

               Randall riveted by the TV now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         They're moving him now, body
                         covered. It would appear that thirty
                         seven year old Phillip Dutton is
                         dead in the line of duty...

               ON THE TV the Newsteam and Gonzalez SHOVED back by COPS
               running defense for the stretcher. Gonzalez grabs for the
               sheet covering the body and...

               NEWSCAM TIGHT on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially
               uncovering...

               DUTTON'S HEAD: Comb-over hanging to the side. Blood dripping
               from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word
               "DAISY."  Quickly covered by a COP who yells at Gonzalez...

                                     COP
                         Out of here! Now!

               ... but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has
               been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez.

               RESUME - FAVORING ERIN struck dumb by this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      34.


                                     GONZALEZ
                         Shocking even for these mean
                         streets, the word "Daisy" apparently
                         cut into his head by the
                         perpetrator, still at large. A
                         name. Perhaps a message...

               Gonzalez FADES UNDER as Erin backs away from the TV.

                                     RANDALL
                         What? What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         Lauren called me that when we were
                         little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

                                     RANDALL
                         Honey. It's doesn't mean anything.
                         It's not a message.

                                     ERIN
                         That guy in the cemetery today
                         said he knew everything about
                         Lauren.

                                     RANDALL
                         It still doesn't mean...

                                     ERIN
                         He said he'd prove it.

               Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               WIDE. The ambulance drives off, lights flashing, and we
               BOOM UP over the crime scene, over the Newsteam, revealing
               the top of Dutton's cruiser, marked with a BLOODRED CROW.

               Continuing upward, FINDING... The Crow, perched high on a
               building. It takes flight.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick
               building, peers down over the edge.

               Camera DRIFTS DOWN the side of he building finding a light,
               someone burning the midnight oil.

               FINDING a CHESS SET mid-game near the open window as...

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               WAM! Erlich's CANE knocks a pile of papers to the floor
               off a desk piled high with briefs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      35.


                                     WALSH
                         I don't know about any knife. I'm
                         trying to forget that case.

                                     ERLICH
                         Well someone isn't. They killed
                         Dutton.

                                     WALSH
                         It wasn't me.

                                     ERLICH
                         No shit. You couldn't get close to
                         him. But I'm betting you know who
                         did. Who's into Corvis? Huh?

               Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor,
               then picks up a PHONE LOG off the desk.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         Not a lot of calls. Business slow?

               He tosses the phone log out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. Watching the phone log fluttering down.

               INCLUDE ALEX, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing
               Dutton's badge on his evolving costume.

               Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         You're the only one gave a flying
                         fuck about him when he was alive.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         Lauren Randall did.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         Hey. Bitches are crazy. Richer
                         they are, crazier they get.

               "THE LIST" The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by
               Alex.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly
               by the collar.

                                     WALSH
                         Maybe if you hadn't fried an
                         innocent kid...

                                     ERLICH
                         Who is it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      36.


                                     WALSH
                         How about the real killer. You
                         think of that?

               Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the
               window, falling by the chess board.

                                     ERLICH
                         If you're covering for someone,
                         that's jail time. I got my eye on
                         you.

               Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. Walsh starts
               to get up, stops. Looking at his own eye level...

               ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's
               cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the
               board. Walsh pulls it out.

               It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop
               Five. Smiles. Looks at...

               THE PAPER UNFOLDED says "Check." Walsh sets it down in the
               Chess Box next to...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN arms around each other in
               the woods, smiling.

               WALSH sensing something, a presence.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back.
               Nothing. He leans out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               CROWVISION: Starting on Walsh, popping his head out the
               window two stories down, INCLUDING Erlich as he exits the
               building, gets in a SILVER PORSCHE.

               Picture bending wildly as the Porsche takes off and the
               Crow takes flight.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. The Porsche pulling to a stop.

               IN THE PORSCHE Erlich looks down, presses a button on the
               stereo. Elvis from his baroque period "If I can Dream."
               Erlich looks up, waves his arms.

                                     ERLICH
                         No, no...

               ERLICH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD A BUM starts to
               "clean" the windshield with an OILY rag, leaving opaque
               smears on the once clean glass.

               THUD. A handful of gravelly MUD lands on the windshield,
               starts to get smeared around. ERLICH pounding the window
               from inside.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         No! Shit!

               The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment.
               Hard to see anything now. Erlich throws up his hands in
               disgust, reaches for the door handle just as...

               SMASH!  The driver side window SHATTERS as something enters
               at high speed KICKING Erlich across the car...

               Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a
               BLOODY SMEAR. Alex in the driver seat now.

                                     ALEX
                         The Germans really know how to
                         make a car, don't they?

               LOW ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE wheels spinning as it peels out.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WINDSHIELD WASHERS and WIPERS clear away the grime Alex
               smeared on the windshield, revealing that we're rocketing
               through a bad part of town.

               MUSIC CONTINUES as Alex pulls the KNIFE out of his costume
               with his LEFT HAND. It looks huge in the cramped sports
               car.

                                     ALEX
                              (re: Lauren knife)
                         I heard you were looking for this.

                                     ERLICH
                         You're the guy killed Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         I want you to think of me as the
                         guy who killed you.

               Erlich pulls a .380 SEMI-AUTO stashed between the two seats.
               Points it at Alex.

                                     ERLICH
                         Stop the car.

               Alex FLOORS it and... BAM.

               Erlich blows a hole through Alex's LEFT ARM, a yawning
               aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery
               a few improbably seconds.

                                     ALEX
                         Ow.

               The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.

                                     ERLICH
                         Fuck. Me.

                                     ALEX
                         What happened to your leg there
                         Officer? Hunting accident?

               WHOP. In one swift move Alex impales the knife THROUGH
               ERLICH'S WRIST, into his thigh. Erlich SCREAMS, tries to
               remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Lauren Randall shot you trying to
                         get free. The fifty three stab
                         wounds she died of came from you.
                         Am I right? Ballpark?

               Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as...

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - NIGHT

               The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light.

               A POLICE CRUISER going the other way pulls a stunt U, flips
               on its lights. In hot pursuit.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic.

                                     ALEX
                         In Saudi Arabia they cut off the
                         hands of petty thieves. What price
                         for a life? Two lives?

               FLASH. Alex yanks the Knife out and FLASH, slices through
               the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the FLESH.
               Erlich's arm bleeding.

                                     ERLICH
                         Not my arm! What you fucking want?

                                     ALEX
                         I want Lauren. I want my life back.
                         I want... to know why.

                                     ERLICH
                         Why? Why's anything happen? It's
                         all money, man. Money. The girl
                         just got in the way.

               Alex grimaces, then RIP, he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's
               arm. Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      39.


                                     ALEX
                         The scar. Which of you has it?

                                     ERLICH
                         Nobody.

               Alex poises the knife for another descent.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         I swear. It's a bullshit fucking
                         story the loser boyfriend made up.

               This gives Alex pause. He shakes his head, clearing the
               reality glitch, looks up...

               IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR Cop cars, lights flashing.

               EXT. CITY STREET #4 - NIGHT

               The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final
               straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side
               of an overpass.

               The cops not far behind. The Porsche bottoming out on a
               bump now ant...

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt. He
               reaches to push it back into position and notices...

               ON THE BACK OF THE VISOR The CAR REGISTRATION. Alex takes
               it out of the holder. RESUME Alex suddenly calm. He reaches
               down for...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER pushed in. The volume on the Elvis
               song pumped up. ALEX relaxes back in his seat as they scream
               toward the abutment.

                                     ERLICH
                         Are you out of your fucking mind?
                         We're going to die.

                                     ALEX
                         How can you die if you're already
                         dead?

                                     ERLICH
                         You're him. Corvis.

                                     ALEX
                         I was talking about you.

               Alex smiles as the CIGARETTE LIGHTER pops out. He grabs it
               and the GLOW vanishes as he closes his fist around it.

               Erlich turns front in horror. The microsecond of terror
               realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in...

                                     ELVIS
                         My dream... comes true... right
                         now!

               EXT. OVERPASS / ABUTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! The Corvette hits at a million mph. Crumpling,
               disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the
               abutment.

               THE CAVALRY - CRUISERS AND PLAINWRAPS Too late. A half
               dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. Screeching
               to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche.  The ruptured
               gas tank spurting GASOLINE.

               A CRUISER screeches to a halt. Both doors fly open. Toomey
               and Larkin step out. Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks
               up the embankment, catches a glimpse of...

               ALEX battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still
               holding the Lighter, glow fading.  He tosses...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER arcs down onto the ex-Corvette. WIDER -
               BOOM!  Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes
               in a huge FIREBALL that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close
               by.

               IN THE TOO-CLOSE COP CAR the DRIVER rams the car into
               REVERSE. Tires squeal as the fireball hits and...

               THE TOO-CLOSE CRUISER Engine compartment ignites, a second
               fireball racing backward into another Cruiser. BOOM!

               Total chaos now. LARKIN focussed on Alex, seen vaguely
               through the flames. Moving toward him.

               WITH LARKIN as he arrives at the top of the enbankment,
               draws his weapon. Hyperalert. Alex is gone, but he finds...

               ERLICH'S BODY two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises.
               Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist.
               It's...

               "THE LIST" Dutton and Erlich crossed off. Larkin and Toomey
               yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all
               contained in a VERTICAL OVAL, "DELT" circled in red.

               LARKIN, AS TOOMEY JOINS HIM They give each other an oh-
               shit look. Then Larkin checkes his fingertips, smeared red
               from...

               "THE LIST" - FLIP SIDE the CROW CIPHER, rendered thick in
               coagulating blood. Illuminated by the flickering light of
               the fire below.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A heart shaped Locket swung gently back and forth,
               then closed in Erin's hand as CAW!

               Erin turns, sees the Crow perched on the window ledge. As
               she moves to the open window, the Crow flies off.

               ERIN'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW - THE CRASH SCENE far away,
               the flashing lights and sirens of fire trucks arriving to
               bring the fire under control.

               ERIN looks, wondering, then spots something closer to hom.
               She moves off, WIPING through frame REVEALING...

               ON THE FRONT LAWY Alex. He looks down now, at the front
               door where...

               Erin exits the front door and we see her framed against
               the huge house, a rich-man's castle built in the twenties
               of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass.

               Erin, like her sister, a child of privilege. She approaches
               Alex.

                                     ERIN
                         Daisy. How did you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I told you, I knew your sister.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed that cop Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         And another one. There. Erlich.
                         Took a wrong turn.

               Alex points at the distant crash site, the vague flashing
               lights.

                                     ERIN
                         I know who you are.
                              (no response)
                         That's why you paint your face. To
                         hide.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm not hiding. I'm right here.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed Lauren! You killed her!

               Erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on,
               then RUSHES ALEX, screaming, beating on him, fists of fury.

                                                                      42.


                                     ALEX
                         Not me. Dirty cops killed her.
                         Dutton, Erlich...

               Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic.
               He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting.
               He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I've been shot, and stabbed and
                         thrown from a car and none of it
                         hurt. But what you're doing now,
                         does. I don't know why.

                                     ERIN
                         My dad was right! He said you'd
                         ruin her life.

                                     ALEX
                         No. Listen to me. Lauren found out
                         something they didn't want her to
                         know.
                              (then)
                         This.

               He holds up a Card, the Registration from the Corvette.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         From the bonfire over there. Look
                         at it.

                                     ERIN
                         No! Why are you haunting me?

                                     ALEX
                         Because you need to understand.
                         And you need... to be careful.

               He tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the
               card through the air. She turns, watching its flight all
               the way to the landing by the front door...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry. Your father wasn't right.

               She turns back and...

               He's gone. Erin walks to the door. Despite herself reaches
               for the Card on the landing. It's...

               THE CORVETTE REGISTRATION which we see clearly for the
               first time. Owned by a company called DELT. The address is
               4201 Forestview Drive.

               ERIN spins around horrified, holds up the Registration.

               THE ADDRESS ON THE REGISTRATION - 4201 FORESTVIEW matches
               the numbers two feet away from her--the address plaque on
               her own house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ROLL CALL BULLPEN - DAY

               The buzz of nervous COP WALLA settles out as a stocky
               SERGEANT #2, clueless but honest, raises his voice, trying
               to command attention.

                                     SERGEANT#2
                         Listen up! Yo! We got a cop killer
                         out there.

               Walla responds "no shit"--and CAMERA BOOMS UP, moving to
               the back of the room over a nervous sea of blue uniforms.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         Til we get an I.D. treat everyone
                         like a suspect. Patrol assignments
                         are posted by the door. Read them.
                         No singles, it's the buddy system
                         til we catch this asshole.

               Sergeant #2 CONTINUES UNDER as CAMERA FINDS...

               FAVORING LARKIN, TOOMEY AND MADDEN huddling together at
               the back. Urgent whispers. Larkin and Toomey try to contain
               their panic.

                                     LARKIN
                         He knows. I saw him. Fucking zombie
                         mask.

                                     MADDEN
                         Calm down.

                                     LARKIN
                         You calm down.

               Larkin takes out "The List" from the crash site.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Whose name's fucking next? Not
                         yours.

                                     TOOMEY
                         You didn't testify. You're not on
                         the list.

                                     MADDEN
                              (flips it over)
                         Scary guy. Not only survives that
                         crash, but takes time out for art.

               He pockets "The List." Then looks up as...

                                                                      44.


                                     SERGEANT#2
                         Madden! Hey!

               The entire room looking back at the three renegades.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         The old man's requested the pleasure
                         of your company.

               Madden shakes his head like this is bad news, rises and
               leaves.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

               A SECRETARY mans a LOW COUNTER guarding a large door at
               the end of the huge empty hall. She's got a heavy mascara
               trailer park vibe, looks up from her eyelash curler at the
               sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS.

               HER POV - THROUGH THE EYELASH CURLER Madden approaches.
               Stops. THE SECRETARY smiles, hits a BUTTON under the
               counter. The door to the Captain's office swings open.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Glad I'm not you.

                                     MADDEN
                         Right back at ya.

               She checks out Madden as he moves past her, then puts the
               eyelash curler away in a NAILIT containing a couple of
               razor sharp SCALPELS.

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

               No sunlight in this cavernous, wood-panelled office. The
               Captain obscure in skifts of shadow at the edge of the
               room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sit down.

               Madden sits.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I thought we had an understanding.
                         I thought we understood that
                         discretion is paramount.

                                     MADDEN
                         Yeah, we do.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Shut up.

               Madden does. The Captain begins and intense slow burn.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      45.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Erlich gimping around in his goddamn
                         hot rod is not discreet. I've got
                         reporters asking me how much he
                         made. I've got the entire force
                         looking at this case now.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know the guy leaves a sign.

               Madden produces "The List," flips it over to show the Crow
               doodle in blood.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No shit he leaves a sign. He's a
                         goddamn Picasso.

               The Captain slaps down a crime scene photo--the Crow
               emblazoned huge on the top of Dutton's cruiser.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What else do you know? Do you know
                         this?

               The Captain SLAMS a file down in front of Madden, who lets
               things cool out a moment before looking at it.

                                     MADDEN
                              (reads cover)
                         Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in
                         the Corvis case.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Some hooker phoned it in. There
                         was a riot at his apartment
                         yesterday.

                                     MADDEN
                         Guy dressed for Halloween?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Good for you. You do know something.

               They look up as the Secretary enters, holding the door
               open, like it's time to leave. Madden starts to speak and...

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't say. Just do. Before it all
                         comes tumbling down.

               The Secretary gives Madden a look as he exits, then joins
               the captain who's standing...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      46.


               BY AN AWARDS CASE holding glass bowls and trophies presented
               to the Captain over the years for Civic Service.

               The Secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he
               looks at his loot.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Idiots.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Sssshhhh.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You're the only one who makes it
                         go away.

               As he turns toward her embrace, CAMERA ADJUSTS to point up
               something we may have noticed...

               IN THE CASE - A STUFFED BIRD, on one of the glass shelves.
               CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - NIGHT

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the large stone house. A light comes
               on at one end of the lower floor, shining through the
               window.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erin works at her father's desk under the light of an
               antique floor lamp. Using a LETTER OPENER to PRY open...

               A DESK DRAWER full of files. She flips through, finds a
               manila file marked--DELT. Takes it out. ERIN lays the file
               open on the desktop.

               EMPTY. She checks...

               A SMALL PAPER SHREDDER under the desk. Judging from the
               paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used.
               ERIN scoops up the shreds of paper. No way to reassemble
               this.

                                     RANDALL
                              (trying to be casual)
                         What are you doing there?

               Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches.

                                     ERIN
                         I think I dropped an earring.

                                     RANDALL
                         Looks like you have them both on.

               She jumps up as her father reaches the desk, keeps her
               distance. He spots the empty DELT folder, closes it.

                         Cops did. Didn't they?

               No response.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You're in with them.

                                     RANDALL
                         It's not what you think.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed her!

                                     RANDALL
                         No.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay away from me! Stay away!

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.

               Erin SCREAMS, runs out the door with her hands over her
               ears. He misses a beat, then RUNS after her.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Nathan catches up with her as she frantically grabs CAR
               KEYS out of a dish by the front door.

               He grabs hold of her arm, she struggles, CLAWS at his face
               to get loose. Squeaks out the door onto...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin runs to the far side of the big Benz, parked in the
               driveway. Tries the door. The ALARM goes off.

                                     RANDALL
                         They killed her because she found
                         out.

                                     ERIN
                         About you.

                                     RANDALL
                         About them. You've got to leave it
                         alone.

               ACROSS THE STREET, A PORCH LIGHT comes on. Erin hits a
               button on the key ring, CHIRP CHIRP. It stops.

                                     RANDALL (CONT'D)
                         Sweetheart...

                                     ERIN
                         Don't call me that! Don't call me
                         anything!

                                                                      48.


               A NEIGHBOR opens the door, peers at them from across the
               street. Inquisitive.

                                     RANDALL
                         I would never hurt you or Lauren.
                         Never. Believe me.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't believe you.

                                     RANDALL
                         Please. Come inside.

                                     ERIN
                         I'm never going back in that house
                         again. Get away.

               He edges away from the car, reluctantly. She starts to get
               in, anger giving way to extreme sadness.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (crying now)
                         They killed Alex for something you
                         did, daddy. You killed both of
                         them.

               She gets in the car. Starts it. ERRRKKKK! She peels out
               backward down the driveway.

               SLAMS the car into Drive and tears off down the street.
               The Neighbor shakes her head at Nathan, goes back inside.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! Thomas Leonard bounces off the wall, drops to the
               floor.

               A FEMALE FIGURE wipes through frame, throws herself on
               Larkin, who's roughing up Tommy.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Please! Leave him alone!

               Larkin backhands her sprawling to the floor, where she
               crawls to the WAILING BABY, takes him in sheltering arms.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'm not making this up. He had a
                         crow with him.

                                     LARKIN
                         Caw, caw, that's what you're telling
                         me.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said I lied at his trial. It's
                         Alex Corvis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      49.


                                     LARKIN
                         So we're talking... a ghost. With
                         a pet bird.

               Tommy nods.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Turn down that fucking baby!

               The baby's gets quieter as the mom rocks it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Get up, Tommy. I want to show you
                         something.

               Larkin helps Tommy to his feet. Places "The List" on the
               table. Then RAMS Tommy's face down on top of it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         You see that? My name's next on
                         his list. It's fucking next.

               Larkin hauls Tommy back upright. Dazed.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         So who is the guy, Tommy?

                                     TOMMY
                         Corvis. It's...

                                     LARKIN
                              (cutting him off)
                         Take your time. Think before you
                         speak. Cause at this point I got
                         to hear something besides the crap
                         you're been spewing.

               KA-CHUNK. Toomey cycles his 9mm. Everything dead silent.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said the whole trial was a setup.
                         That I caused an innocent kid to
                         die. Is that true?

               Larkin grimaces. The only question is how to end this.

               EXT. TENEMENT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               Madden stands by a plainwrap ,calmly SMOKING.

               A SCREAM above. He looks up to see CRASH!

               Tommy's BODY breaks through a window four floors up and
               falls with broken glass, landing by Madden who rubs his
               temple a second, then calmly grinds out the butt.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Tommy's wife horrified, pleading, as Toomey raises his
               weapon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      50.


                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         No, please...

               Her voice stops mid-sentence as BAM.

               The baby still crying as Toomey takes aim again, then lowers
               his weapon, starts to leave the room with Larkin. At the
               door, Toomey turns and BAM!

               The crying stops.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A diminished field of Chess Pieces. ADJUST to include
               Walsh, scrutinizing the board.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               He looks out the window a second. Then scans the room again.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         C'mon. I'm talking to my myself
                         here. It's humiliating.

               Walsh goes back to the board, makes a move.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Check and mate.

                                     ALEX
                         Dream on.

               Walsh looks up. Nothing. Then Alex steps from the shadows.
               Walsh looks at him a long moment, sees through the makeup.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. It's really you under there.

               The two guys look at each other a long moment, cross the
               few steps to hug. Walsh blown away.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         I'd like to say you're looking
                         good, but...

               Walsh leans in, examines Dutton's BADGE on Alex's costume.

                                     ALEX
                         Two down. Two to go.

                                     WALSH
                         "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.

                                     ALEX
                         The cops from my trial. They killed
                         Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (off Walsh)
                         You think I'm crazy.

                                     WALSH
                         I'm thinking... that explains a
                         lot.

               Walsh sits down. Disturbed.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren's father's involved. He
                         bought the cops fancy cars, I don't
                         know what else. It's a company
                         called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren
                         found out.

                                     WALSH
                         What do they do that they had to
                         kill her?

                                     ALEX
                         I was hoping you'd find out.

                                     WALSH
                         Yeah. I sure will.

               They both turn as the Crow lands in the window, CAWS.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                              (at the bird)
                         Boo!

               The Crow flies off. Walsh goes to the window and looks
               out.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         What's the deal with this bird.
                         It's been hanging around. Alex?

               He turns toward Alex, who's gone. A double take as Walsh
               gets it, whips around, looks out the window again. CUT TO:

               EXT. REMOTE ROAD - FOREST - NIGHT

               Far above a solitary car winding through an old-growth
               forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness.

               The Crow soars into frame, watching.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               A simple WOODEN CROSS illuminated by the headlights of the
               Big Benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge
               trees dripping with moss.

               IN THE BENZ Erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving
               the headlights on. Silence.

               WITH ERIN as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross.
               Partway there...

               CAW! Erin looks up, finds the Crow fluttering in to perch
               high overhead. Alex emerges from behind a tree, near the
               cross.

                                     ALEX
                         This is where it happened. Right
                         over here.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, I know.

               She stays where she is. Alex quiet, affected by the place.
               Erin's about to lose it.

                                     ALEX
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         When Lauren was missing the police
                         came to our house. They said they
                         were looking for her, right?
                              (breaking down)
                         But I know now they had her, and
                         the reason they brought her here
                         and knew the could blame it on
                         you...

                                     ALEX
                         No...

                                     ERIN
                         ... is that I sent them here. I
                         told them she came here sometimes.
                         With her dirtball boyfriend. That's
                         exactly what I said.

               She's crying softly. He draws nearer.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. It's not your fault.

                                     ERIN
                              (losing it now)
                         It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish
                         I were dead.

                                     ALEX
                         No. You don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Yes I do, I really do.

               Seeming to lose patience, Alex lunges at her, like an
               attack.

                                     ALEX
                         There were four of them.

                                     ERIN
                         No...

               He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring IMAGES
               that shake them both.

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Jolting FLASHES.

               A Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now.

               A hand slams the car into Park. Doors open. Four men get
               out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

               Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat,
               her hands cuffed in front of her.

               Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         Four large men. And still...

               Lauren stumbles into Erlich, grabs and BAM! FLASH!

               He takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered
               weapon.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         She grabbed one of their guns. Got
                         off a shot, then ran, ran for her
                         life.

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin's covering her face, like trying to
               avoid seeing some horrible thing.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to know.

               Alex grabs Erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly,
               like a three legged race. Tracing the path Lauren covered.

                                     ALEX
                         She ran. Them breathing down her
                         neck...

               Erin stumbling as Alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of
               them running toward a large tree, MATCHING to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands
               hindering, tree limbs hitting her face.

               Her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her
               heels.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         ... all the way from the road to
                         this tree...

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin still trying not to see. Alex forcing
               her.

                                     ALEX
                         This tree. Here's where it happened.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to see!

               Alex spins her up against the tree and we MATCH to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter
               destined to lose. Her movements UNDERCRANKED, strobed.
               Discontinuous and jarring.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         She turned and faced them and went
                         down kicking and punching and
                         fighting them, fighting death as
                         they stabbed her and stabbed her.
                         Fifty three times.

               The brutal cops overwhelm Lauren. She drops to the ground
               as...

               RESUME Erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs.

                                     ALEX
                         She fought for her life because
                         life is worth living.

               Alex panting. Fierce.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think about that. And then tell me
                         how much you wish you were dead.

               Off Erin, sobbing, heartbroken. Alex's fury waning as he
               looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Armed men and barbed wire. The Spotlight FLARES and we're...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               An odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall.
               Mercer escorts Madden, the Captain, and the Secretary who
               hangs on her bosses arm, gawking like a tourist.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Why wasn't the incident reported?

                                     MERCER
                         Nothing to report. All inmates
                         were present and accounted for.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         So you pretended nothing happened.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      55.


                                     MERCER
                         Hey, Corvis fried. I don't really
                         see how it could be him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No. I wouldn't expect you to.

               They all enter...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               Mercer goes to the locker where he left Alex.

                                     MERCER
                         Be forewarned. Nature takes its
                         toll.
                              (opens locker)
                         Bon appetit.

               The all look inside. The locker is empty. Mercer's the
               only one shocked. He noisily opens and shuts the other
               lockers looking for Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You lost him! Now lay off the
                         fucking doors!

               Mercer stops, backs off, gives the power trio some space.

                                     MADDEN
                         They botched the execution.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Could say that.

                                     MADDEN
                         Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard
                         was right.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Maybe you were a little harsh on
                         him.

               They watch now as the Secretary moves, drawn to the mirror.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         Babe?

               She's looking at... T

               HE FRACTURED MIRROR. Shards of glass selectively removed
               forming, we see now, a CROW.

                                     MADDEN
                         Fucking crow.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sign of the dead come back to life.

               Madden turns, not comfortable with the concept.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      56.


                                     MADDEN
                         How about sign of a big black bird?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The dead can return, given
                         sufficient motivation. And Corvis
                         has that.

                                     SECRETARY
                         This guy David Jenkins came back
                         as a ghost because my uncle owed
                         him four dollars. Followed him
                         everywhere. Ruined his life.

                                     MADDEN
                         Time out. You really saying he's
                         back from beyond?

               The Secretary nestles into the Captain, who whispers in
               her ear. He nods.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Cause if you're losing your mind,
                         I got a right to know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He's looking for something. Won't
                         stop until he finds it.
                              (then)
                         Sometimes the best way to get rid
                         of someone is to let them have
                         what they want.

                                     SECRETARY
                         The man...

                                     ALEX
                         ... with the scar...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               WIDE. Erin sits cross-legged in the HEADLIGHTS of the Benz.
               Alex perches Crow-like on the hood.

                                     ALEX
                         ... took everything I ever cared
                         about. Left me with nothing.

                                     ERIN
                         So you're going to kill him?

                                     ALEX
                         Have to find him first.

               He closes his eyes. Pained at a memory.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You know what Lauren and I were
                         fighting about that night? She had
                         a secret, wouldn't tell me...

                                     ERIN
                         My father.

                                     ALEX
                         All I knew, she was pulling away.
                         It made me crazy.

                                     ERIN
                         I used to be so proud of him. My
                         big deal daddy. And now, he's just
                         a crook. Worse even. And the weird
                         thing is...

               She fights back tears. Gains strength.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I wish I could hate him but I can't.
                         He said he'd never hurt either of
                         us, and I know it's true and...
                         I'm going back.

                                     ALEX
                         It's what Lauren would do.

               Erin nods, takes the Locket off her neck.

                                     ERIN
                         I want to forget. Forget what I
                         know. Forget myself. Forget
                         everything.

               She winds up to toss the Locket away and Alex hops down
               off the hood. Stops her. Takes the Locket. ALEX

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (re: Locket)
                         Keep it. Because it connects you
                         to Lauren. And it connects you to
                         me.

               He fastens the Locket back around her neck. A covenant.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         No matter what happens I'll make
                         sure everyone knows. That you're
                         innocent. That you loved her. I
                         promise.

               CLOSE. Erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket.
               Dumps it on the ground. Finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among
               the containers.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't want to be me anymore.
                         Make me like you.

               Erin's face blasted WHITE by HEADLIGHTS.

               She closes her eyes as Alex begins the first bold lines
               around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light,
               she could be...

               LAUREN opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again.

               WIDER. Alex paints Erin's face in the Benz headlights, the
               two of them kneeling in the forest-cathedral.

               Camera creeps BACKWARD, leaving the two of them connected
               by ritual. And touch. And a promise to each other.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL'S HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A mess of documents. Nathan nervously writing,
               assembling a tell-all at his desk.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know it doesn't work this way.

               Nathan gets up. Tries to subtly herd the Captain off.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm out of this.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Partnerships don't end like that.
                         Friendships don't.

                                     NATHAN
                         Our friendship ended when Lauren
                         died.

               The Captain circles to the desk now, past Nathan.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?
                         Because there's a ghost threatening
                         us.

                                     RANDALL
                         You mean Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I mean Lauren.

               The Captain flips through some of the papers on the desk.
               Frowns. He closes a file folder.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Because you never accepted that
                         what happened to her was an
                         accident.

                                     RANDALL
                         You killed my daughter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      59.


                                     CAPTAIN
                         An accident, Nathan.

                                     RANDALL
                              (exploding now)
                         She was eighteen years old! There
                         were four of them. They stabbed
                         her fifty three times! Where's the
                         fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is
                         it?!

               Nathan furious. The Captain keeps a preternatural calm.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I watched her grow up. Just like
                         you. I know how her mind worked.
                         She kept snooping around because
                         she was worried about you. What
                         you'd gotten yourself into. So
                         stop blaming me. And blame yourself.

                                     RANDALL
                              (beat, quietly)
                         I do. Every day.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Erin knows, doesn't she?

               This catches Nathan off guard. He starts to say something.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't even bother. You never were
                         a good liar.

               The Captain flips through the papers on the desk again.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Look at this. Everything we worked
                         for. You tell me... what are we
                         going to do?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               HEADLIGHTS approach from down the street. The Big Benz
               pulls into the empty driveway.

               Erin alone in the car, her mood tough to judge in the Crow
               mask.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Erin enters, steels herself. Then she calls out...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad?! You home?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER. Erin plunges her masked face into the wash
               basin in this white-tiled bathroom.

               ANGLE - ERIN A few SLO-MO DROPLETS cascade off her face
               into basin as she scrutinizes herself in the mirror, wipes
               off the mask.

               CAMERA INCHING forward...

               She listens up. Grabs a Towel to blot the water on her
               face. We begin to hear with her...

               DRIP. DRIP. DRIP...

               She tightens the sink faucets. The sound continues DRIP
               DRIP as she moves to...

               THE CLAWFOOT BATHTUB Faucet not dripping, but the sound is
               louder. DRIP DRIP. Erin grabs the shower curtain, whips it
               back REVEALING...

               NATHAN RANDALL behind the tub, face a mask of gore, blown
               off point blank by the BLOODY HANDGUN on the tile next to
               him. ERIN screams.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. The Chess set. A few pieces moved off the board
               now. Alex not looking at it. He's looking at the picture
               of himself and Lauren taped in the lid of the Chess box.

                                     WALSH
                         It's like a bowl of spaghetti. D-E-
                         L-T is owned by Westwind Builders,
                         Nathan Randall's company. But DELT
                         in turn owns a dozen other
                         corporations. A big mess to wade
                         through, so I checked out Tommy
                         Leonard.

               Alex picks up the BLACK KING.

                                     ALEX
                         Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't
                         matter. I want the King.

                                     WALSH
                         We're getting there. Because in
                         his so-called construction job,
                         Tommy makes a daily delivery to a
                         place called "The Hole."

                                     ALEX
                         The strip joint?

                                     WALSH
                         I believe they call it a
                         connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.

               Alex places the picture of himself with Lauren back in the
               box of chess pieces, against the open lid.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Places like that, they're about
                         unreported cash, processing money
                         from drugs, prostitution.
                              (then)
                         I took a chance, called asking for
                         Larkin and Toomey, the two other
                         cops. Whoever answered said "they're
                         not here...
                              (meaningfully)
                         ... this is the front office."

               BAM BAM BAM.

               They look up. A shadow banging on the door. Leaving BLOODY
               SMEARS on the outside of the frosted glass.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex!

               Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood
               smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         They killed my dad.

               It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion.
               She throws herself into his arms.

                                     ALEX
                         It's ok, it's ok...

                                     ERIN
                         It's not. I can't take it.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. Who?

                                     ERIN
                         I don't know. I found him lying
                         there.

               Alex immobilized by this. He turns to Walsh.

                                     ALEX
                         Where is it? This place?

                                     WALSH
                         I think we should get some support?

                                     ALEX
                         What? Call the police?

                                     ERIN
                         What is this? Where are you going?

               Alex waiting for an address. Finally...

                         1315 Berkeley Street.

                                     ERIN
                         Don't leave me. Please.

               Alex turns to her, comforting. Holds her face in his hands.

                                     ALEX
                         It will be over soon.
                              (then)
                         Watch out for each other.

               He heads off and we PRE-LAP sexbomb death metal POUNDING...
               CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               More debauched than our previous visit. Darker, more
               crowded.

               Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely
               eighteen. The room writhing.

               ON THE MAINSTAGE the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but
               dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a
               handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them.

               AT THE ENTRANCE Alex blows past people waiting to get in,
               creating enough disturbance that TWO BOUNCERS greet him.

                                     ALEX
                         Toomey and Larkin. They're expecting
                         me.

               The Two Bouncers give each other a look. One points to a
               SIGN on the wall: "You must be 21..."

                                     BOUNCER
                         I need to see some I.D., pal. Circus
                         in town?

               The Other Bouncer grabs Alex as he pushes past. Alex heaves
               him into the line of WAITING PATRONS.

               As they go down like dominoes... the First Bouncer pulls a
               GUN.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't think you want to do that.
                         Lot of innocent people here...
                              (looks around)
                         A lot of people, anyway.

               As Alex starts off... BAM! He's blown back by a shot half
               lost in the noisy club. No panic yet.

               ONSTAGE the strippers break character, looking. The audience
               turns as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      63.


               NEAR THE ENTRANCE The First Bouncer goes flying above the
               heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic SHOT while
               airborne, inducing...

               PANDEMONIUM Patrons stampeding as BAM BAM!  Alex taking
               bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit. The Bouncers
               out of sight underfoot.

               ON ALEX visible again, back on his feet. Buffeted,
               stationary as everyone flees. With the exodus still at
               flood stage...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               ON WALSH, in motion as he puts on a jacket, throws some
               papers into a briefcase. He's nervous, ill-suited for this
               cloak and dagger stuff, chattering...

                                     WALSH
                         We'll be safe in my car. Nobody
                         will recognize it. Let's move yours
                         in back, no, down the block. Hope
                         it's nothing fancy. There's a chop
                         shop around the corner.

               She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly
               opened. The Captain stands there. Somber reptile. Holding
               a sheaf of papers in one hand.

                                     ERIN
                         You followed me here.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No... Erin, I put out a bulletin
                         on your car because... there's bad
                         news. And I thought you should
                         hear it from me.

               She stares at him expressionless.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Your father got involved with some
                         bad cops. On my force, so I take
                         responsibility.
                              (beat, then)
                         He killed himself.

               She talks with great difficulty.

                                     ERIN
                         How?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         How did he kill himself?

               She nods.

                                                                      64.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         With a gun. Is that what you mean?

                                     ERIN
                         No. I mean... how did he kill
                         himself How do you figure he killed
                         himself--with a gun, right--when
                         it wasn't anywhere near where you
                         found him?

               He takes a step toward her. She pulls out the Blood Pistol.
               Seems crazy enough to use it.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You killed him.

                                     WALSH
                         Erin. Don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Back the fuck off! Now!

               The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward
               her, onto Walsh's desk.

               The papers Nathan was preparing. Walsh looks at them
               while...

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He left this. Names, addresses, a
                         note to you. These people he was
                         involved with killed Lauren. He
                         couldn't bear it anymore.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. He's right, it's all here.

                                     ERIN
                         The note. Show it to me.

               Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's
               hand. The Captain inches forward.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (to Captain)
                         Not you!
                              (to Walsh)
                         Show it to me.

               The Captain steps forward, right to the desk. Erin backed
               into a corner now.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         It's right there, under that paper.
                              (grabs a note)
                         Here. Look.

               She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the
               situation for one second as she reads...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      65.


               THE NOTE A bunch of numbers added together in her father's
               hand. Not a suicide note.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs Erin's wrist and BAM!

               A chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. The
               Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the
               trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You were always the stupid one.

               She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers,
               wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now. BAM!

               WALSH blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board. Trying
               to pull himself up. Erin struggling. As...

               MADDEN enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.

                                     MADDEN
                         You need help?

               He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hurry. We don't have much time.

               BAM. A shot from Madden drops Walsh for god. As Madden
               drags Walsh toward the door, the Captain grabs...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN pulled off the lid of the
               Chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. The
               Captain exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               MUSIC STILL POUNDS, lights swirl. But the club has cleared
               out, leaving human detritus, a handful of casualties from
               the stampede.

               WITH ALEX as he steps over the Two Bouncers, expired on
               the floor.

               A soft WHIMPERING marks the silence.  The girl cuffed
               onstage. Alex goes up to the terrified girl.

               Close up, she looks way underage. He gathers her clothes,
               spots a key on the floor.

                                     ALEX
                         How old are you?

               She listens as he unlocks the cuffs.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You have one chance to value your
                         life. Take it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      66.


               He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still
               half naked. As she leaves...

               THE CROW appears in the doorway near the broken bodies.
               Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts.

               The casualties. CAW. The Crow flies on, disappearing into
               the back rooms. Alex turns, follows...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               Alex moves past the empty makeup table. A lipstick cigarette
               smolders in an ashtray. People left in a hurry. MUSIC LOUD,
               as if inside our heads now. Alex continues...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               Nobody home. Empty images refreshed every six seconds.
               Number of hits static now. Alex drawn now by the "No
               Admittance" Curtain which he approaches slowly, touching
               it and FLASH!

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN looking over her shoulder,
               pulling back the "No Admittance" Curtain, going where she
               shouldn't go.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren? You were here?

               Lauren makes her stealthy way into....

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               revealed as Alex slips past the Curtain, retracing Lauren's
               footsteps. CAMERA FOLLOWS Alex CREEPING down the hall to...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN down the hall, peering inside
               the partially open Back Room door, then turning back
               startled TOWARD CAMERA as if suddenly overtaken.

               AT THE DOOR Alex turns back, like Lauren, looks behind
               him. The hallway is empty. He enters...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a LIGHTER
               FLARES. Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch.

               Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots
               of eyes. Not taxidermy specimens.

               BAM BAM BAM BAM.

               A dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges
               into Alex in an angry, STROBING fusillade. In the silence
               that follows...

                                     LARKIN
                              (after the fact)
                         Don't move.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      67.


               The gang LAUGHS. Larkin makes his way to a light switch by
               the door.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Drinks are on me.

               Larkin flips on the low-watt BARE BULBS hanging down past
               industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the
               cinderblock space.

               NO ALEX.

                                     ALEX
                         Cheers.

               They look up and... BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to
               the forehead. BAM!

               He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around
               him. Alex scampers across framing as...

               The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to
               near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's
               fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots
               Toomey, rolls out as...

               THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM!

               Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls
               onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend
               himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank,
               more advancing cops. While...

               TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs
               out the door on hands and knees while...

               A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As
               the echoes dissolve...

               Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check
               the body...

               THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened
               properly.

               The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds
               another nameplate underneath. "Hauser."  Heads off in search
               of...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Toomey!

               INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when...

                                     ALEX
                         You dripped something!

               Toomey panics as he approaches...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      68.


               INTERNET FANTASY SETS Monitors still updating every six
               seconds. Toomey hears Alex coming, slips through the
               "Dungeon."

               BEHIND THE SHOWER FANTASY SET Toomey takes refuge out of
               sight, next to a GAS HOT WATER HEATER, quiet as a mouse.
               ALEX tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its
               rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see...

               THE DUNGEON MONITOR Toomey (frozen) scurrying through.
               Gone now as the monitor updates. Then Alex appears,
               following him through the set...

               WITH ALEX moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's
               heels. WAM. Toomey hits him full force with A PIPE, sending
               Alex sprawling backward, COLLAPSING the flimsy Shower set.

               WAM. Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with...

               THE GAS LINE to the water heater ripped out by the blow.
               HISS. The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks.

               RESUME Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to
               get his gun pointed in Alex's face. Hissing gas nearby.

               CLICK. Toomey cocks the gun.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Spark, gas... bad combination. And
                         it's not this leak here, that's
                         the least of your worries.

               WAM! Alex swings Toomey's pipe HARD at a much bigger GAS
               LINE right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked.
               The hiss magnified 100% nos.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         We're going to play a little game
                         called "Who's got the Scar."

                                     TOOMEY
                         What Scar? What fucking scar?

                                     ALEX
                              (buzzer sound)
                         AAAANK. That's not how we play the
                         game.

               Alex jacks Toomey's sleeve down. No Scar. Alex pissed as
               Toomey locks eyes with him. Really seeing him now.

                                     TOOMEY
                         You're him! You're Corvis! We fried
                         your ass. You're dead, man!

                                     ALEX
                         Good thing in a situation like
                         this.

               We pick up...

                                                                      69.


               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Some light filters in as a door opens to the outside. A
               FIGURE enters, squats among the bodies. He leans in, closes
               larkin's eyes, and we see...

               It's Madden. Blood on his hands. He hears Alex's VOICE
               faintly, then Toomey cries out in pain. Madden moves
               toward...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Madden creeps down the hallway to the back room. VOICES
               growing louder.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Fucking Zombie.

                                     ALEX
                         The scar.

                                     TOOMEY
                         There is no scar. I'm telling you.

               As Madden moves toward the conversation, his face registers
               the slightest of smiles.

               MADDEN'S CREEPING POV MONITORS obliquely visible as he
               reaches the end of the hall by the Fantasy sets. The
               "Shower" monitor shows Alex and Toomey, visible through
               the trashed set, updated every six seconds.

               MADDEN SNIFFS gas. The HISS now audible along with Alex's
               voice. Madden smiles. Pulls out his 9mm.

               And BACKS UP, away from the Fantasy Sets toward the back
               room. Madden takes aim at...

               THE FIRST MONITOR The images is Alex threatening Toomey.
               Updating now--LOSING ALEX on the Monitor as he steps into
               frame in person, looks up and BAM!

               CROWVISION a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and...

               ANGLE - GROUND ZERO as the bullet hits the monitor in a
               shower of sparks, followed by...

               BOOM! A ROILING FIREBALL Seems to vaporize Alex before
               flying down the hallway right at CAMERA.

               Madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows
               him into the back room with a deafening roar.

               EXT. "THE HOLE" - INFERNO - NIGHT

               BOOM! Windows blow out in a gas fired inferno. A body flung
               out the rear door. BOOM!

               EXT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               Interior/exterior being less meaningful than seconds ago.
               Walls crumbled, roof blown off.

               BRIGHT FIRE consumes the frame, consumes the bodies of
               downed cops, consumes every last bit of oxygen and life.
               Distant SIRENS draw closer.

               A SLOW SCAN, someone's OBSTRUCTED POV of Hell.

               INCLUDE ALEX watching from under a collapsed cinderblock
               wall that offers some protection from the flames, if not
               the heat. He looks, intent now, spotting...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION sticking out of the
               rubble, murky through the flames, growing clearer as camera
               PUSHES, flames licking at it...

               ALEX tries to move toward the arm. Forced back by too-
               intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts
               and...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION skeletal now, baked
               down to bones. A dozen short metal rods on the ground under
               it. He picks a few up. THE CAPTAIN drawn now to...

               UNDER THE RUBBLE - WHERE ALEX WAS water dripping off the
               concrete, collecting in the place where Alex hid. But he's
               long gone. The Captain drops the rods. Satisfied it's over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #5 - NIGHT

               Alex staggers along in bad shape. Up ahead...

               A GIRL in her twenties exits a building down a flight of
               stairs, waits at the bottom for her BOYFRIEND, who's locking
               the door. She sees Alex, gives him an empathetic look.
               Alex walks slowly closer.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren appearing to him, playing their
               game. But the words are wrong, distorted.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your witness list is no match for
                         my kung fu.

               Her Bruce Lee "Oooo" a siren call. RESUME Alex moving slowly
               forward on the street, drawn toward the girl who watches
               with horrified fascination.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm losing you.

                         for...

               Lauren and Alex drawing very close now when... RESUME WAM.
               A FIST clocks Alex in the face, dropping him hard onto the
               pavement.

                                     GIRL
                         Did you have to do that?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         How about "thank you."

                                     GIRL
                         He's bleeding.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't bleed.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         And delirious. Better steer clear.

               ALEX'S POV

               The Guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl, walks
               her off. Running into a COP at the next intersection. They
               POINT at...

               ALEX takes off, ducking into an alley. Confused.

               CAMERA CREEPS BACKWARD as he gathers his thoughts.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               RATTLE RATTLE. Alex's shadow visible through the frosted
               glass, jostling the locked door.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin!

               SMASH. His arm PUNCHES through the glass, turn the knob.
               Alex enters, arm bleeding badly. He yanks a large piece of
               glass from his flesh. Painful.

               Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a
               necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the
               flow. He scans the room again looking for...

               Something. But everything seems ok. He passes...

               The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a
               piece of TAPE left, sticking to the top of the open lid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      72.


               OVER THE CHESS BOARD - ALEX the missing pic lost on him,
               drawn to the chess board where Walsh collapsed. Something
               wrong with the game. He finds...

               THE BLACK KING Off the board. On top of a stack of news
               clippings lying on the floor.

               Alex picks it up, LEAVING a RING OF BLOOD under.

               CAMERA PUSHES on the clipping underneath, the headline
               "City Leaders Vow Crackdown in Wake of Randall Murder."
               PUSHING, finding among the City Leaders...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         The King.

               THE CAPTAIN'S FACE circled in blood. Camera continues to
               PUSH on the grainy newsprint, through it, until all we see
               are halftone pixels and the picture loses meaning.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Police Station in sinister CROWVISION as we approach,
               swoop in and...

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY

               Alex walks the long approach to the Captain's office, past
               the empty Secretary's desk. KICKING the door open CRASH!
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

               The Captain works alone at his desk under a standing lamp.
               Looks up unconcerned as Alex enters, walks to the desk,
               and SLAPS down the ring-of-blood clipping.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I hate that picture.

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Can I get you something? A glass
                         of water? A transfusion?

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they? Last chance.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Or what? You'll bleed all over my
                         carpet?

               The Captain rises.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You know crime was actually down

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         around, or whatever the hell you're
                         doing here.
                              (then)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     ALEX
                         I'm looking for my friends.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         See, I heard you were looking for
                         some guy with a scar. How's that
                         going? You find him? Yes? No?

               Alex tenses as the Captain starts toward him.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You are like the guest who would
                         not leave, you know that?  And
                         judging from your condition, maybe
                         you've overstayed your welcome.
                         That's not a criticism. Just an
                         observation.

               Alex draws the knife from his clothes.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't think you're going to use
                         it. That's Lauren's knife.

               Enraged, Alex SWIPES the knife. The Captain grabs his arm
               right at the blood soaked necktie, squeezes hard. Alex
               writhes in pain. In each other's faces now.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You come in here al lfull of
                         righteous indignation, but what
                         have you got to be righteous about?

               THE KNIFE starting to fall from Alex's hand as the Captain
               continues to clamp down on his wound.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         How many innocent people did you
                         leave dead back there?

                                     ALEX
                         You sent them. I had no choice.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Bullshit. You're a killer, that's
                         all you are. A clown with a bird
                         and a rising death toll. You think
                         the world did you wrong?! You did
                         the world wrong.

               The Captain snatches the knife, RAMS it into Alex's midriff.

               The Captain drops Alex lifeless and bloody to the floor.
               Only the sound of the Captain panting now, then...

               The sound of slow clapping. Madden walks into the room
               from behind perimeter curtains.

               CLAP CLAP CLAP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      76.


                                     MADDEN
                         You were right. Picture's worth a
                         thousand words.

               Madden kicks Alex lightly, nudging him. No life signes.
               The Captain rips the picture in two. Tosses it in the trash.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Just don't believe everything you
                         see.

                                     MADDEN
                         Doubt is a motherfucker.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Give me a hand with this sack of
                         shit.

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               NEW ANGLE - THROUGH A WINDOW DARKLY Madden and the Captain
               grab Alex, one at each end.

                                     SECRETARY
                         He's cute. Was cute.

               REVEAL, this is the Secretary's POV through the window.
               She's bent over someone's toes, painting them BLUE.

               WIDE. The Mystery Room revealed. Taxidermy specimens line
               the wall and the table.

               Erin stands in PROFILE in the middle of the room, strangely
               silent, hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the
               ceiling.

               The Secretary brushing polish on Erin's toes.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         But the face, well, makeup can
                         work for you or against you. Right?

               The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then
               stands, kisses Erin gently.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         All done. Very nice.
                              (then)
                         You're a good listener.

               The Secretary moves off REVEALING...

               ERIN'S FACE MOUTH SEWN shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like
               the scar. Her eyes dart as...

               THE DOOR opens. The Captain and Madden carry Alex in. Madden
               sweeps the TAXIDERMY SPECIMENS back with his hand, clearing
               a space for Alex on the table. Among them...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      77.


               THE CROW on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small
               hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as...

               RESUME WHUMP. Alex heaved onto the table.

                                     MADDEN
                         So was he dead? Or alive?

               The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I've seen birds stuffed and mounted
                         so lifelike you'd swear you saw
                         them breathing.

               This reminds him... he looks at the Crow on the stand.
               Lifeless, stuffed. As it should be.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Maybe we had a case of that here.
                              (to Secretary)
                         Get me my kit.

                                     MADDEN
                         You two are majorly demented. Anyone
                         ever tell you that?

               The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's
               lifeless open eyes pointing toward Erin, reflected in his
               eyeballs first before...

               ANGLE - ERIN looking up at her own hands, bound above her
               as she eases them apart and...

               The HEART SHAPED LOCKET slips from between her palms and
               she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket
               swinging.

               ON THE TABLE X-CLOSE. The locket reflected in Alex's
               lifeless open eyes a second before...

               The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline. Lays out
               the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition.
               Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for
               the procedure.

               Stab wounds everywhere.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Fifty three?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         In all the excitement I kind of
                         lost count.
                              (then)
                         I think I'll mount him with his
                         head up his ass.

               A large KNIFE, the Lauren murder weapon, angles in at the
               base of Alex'sneck where the Secretary's head was.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      78.


               THE CROW - OVERCRANKED moves on the table. Takes flight.

               THE TRIO turn toward the commotion.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Grab it!

               THE LOCKET - OVERCRANKED Snatched in midair by the Crow
               from Erin's praying hands.

               FLASH!  ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV HIGH ANGLE CROWVISION.
               Dim memories from the woods. Anamorphic and dark.

               Two figures--Alex and Erin--kneeling. RESUME - THE LOCKET
               released from the Crow's beak, passing through the TRIO'S
               HANDS uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front
               of his open eyes.

               ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV FLASH. AT GROUND LEVEL. Alex
               fastens the LOCKET around her neck. The distortion
               lessening, becoming Alex's POV.

                                     ALEX
                         ... it connects you to me...

               FLASH.

                                     ERIN
                         No matter what happens... you're
                         innocent... I promise...

               FLASH. Alex painting her face.

               RESUME Alex BLINKS. The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to
               bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest.

               WAM! Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping
               the movement on a dime.

                                     ALEX
                         All lies. Everything you ever showed
                         me.

               MADDEN pulls a gun, points it at Erin. ALEX jumps up, flying
               INTO the gun as it goes off.

               CRASH! They tumble THROUGH THE WINDOW into the Captain's
               office while...

               THE CAPTAIN cuts down the rope holding Erin. She
               collapses...

               ON THE TABLE strewn with blades, secreting one between her
               hands, in the second before...

               THE CAPTAIN drags Erin off. The Secretary flails at the
               Crow with a metal ROD, while...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden has the gun on Alex now.
               BAM! No effect. BAM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      79.


               Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect
               as...

               THE MYSTERY ROOM The Secretary finally connects with the
               Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides
               with...

               Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself. Madden
               c Onfused, not understanding.

                                     SECRETARY (O.S.)
                         It's the bird! Kill it!

               Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture
               window into...

               The SECRETARY dives for cover as bullets explode around
               her. The Crow dancing, sprayed with debris.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               CLOSE. Floor lights sequence above the door, heading for
               underground parking.

               "5 - 4 - 3..." The Captain watches the lights. Erin is
               slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite
               him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You brought him back. Good. He
                         owes you. We'll stick together,
                         you and I.

               ON ERIN face pressed against the elevator wall, intent.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Seen but not heard. They ought to
                         make it a law.

               Erin winces, looks down...

               THE BLADE emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it
               with her two bound hands. DING. The elevator jerks to a
               stop.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs her off the floor and she RAMS the blade
               into his abdomen with the force of the entire body. Twists
               it. The elevator doors open.

               ERIN pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the
               Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she
               swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood. Running now,
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage,
               cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      80.


               Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded
               animal. He pulls out a GLOCK 9MM and KA-CHUNK. Cycles it.
               Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees.
               Looks around.

               HER POV - SCANNING a small garage with a few police cruisers
               by a SERVICE AREA and no people. A barred GATE over the
               exit. No way out.

               ERIN winces. Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches
               off her mouth with the knife. Drops the threads on the
               floor and moves off...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Alex runs past the glass AWARDS CASE, takes a flying leap
               behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at
               him.

               The slide ratchets back. Madden SLAMS another clip in,
               advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as...

               THE SECRETARY clears stuffed birds off the table trying to
               expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Here pretty bird. Here birdy.

               WHOP! She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden creeps up on the desk, peers
               over it. Nothing. Out of nowhere...

               WAM!  Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room
               with a pained cry of brute force toward...

               THE AWARDS CASE CRASH! Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden,
               who swivels around in time to get off a last shot BAM!

               That collapses Alex to the floor.

               IN THE MYSTERY ROOM The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's
               grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers.

               AT THE AWARD'S CASE Alex hauls himself off the floor as
               the Crow joins him. Seeing...

               MADDEN'S HEAD has taken its place among glass bowls and
               trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests
               on. Down the shelf from the stuffed bird. ALEX rushes
               through the blown out window into...

               Seeing for the first time that Erin is gone, the rope
               hanging from the ceiling, finding...

               THE SECRETARY

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      81.


                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         sitting on the floor, painting her
                         own toenails BLUE, leaning up
                         against the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         Where'd they go?

               Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around
               her neck, her back to the wall. She looks UP, smiling at...

               WALSH - RIGHT ARM MISSING hangs high overhead from some
               kind of hook. His arm has been crudely removed.

               Underneath him, on the table, a BOX of 2" surgical stainless
               steel rods sits by a pool of blood. ALEX yells, reeling,
               as...

               The door flies open. A half dozen cops in, all targeting
               Alex as...

               THE SECRETARY plunges the Lauren KNIFE in Alex's back. He
               spins violently THROWING her HARD against the wall. WAM!

               Surprise!-she sticks. REVEAL, she's impaled on ANTELOPE
               ANTLERS, hanging off the wall. Her head drops, looking
               down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off
               her toes...

                                     SECRETARY
                              (dying words)
                         My nails.

               BAM BAM BAM. The new arrivals open fire. Alex reaches over
               his shoulder, yanks out the knife with an odd slurping
               sound as...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE

               The sound of GUNFIRE filters down from above as the Captain
               hunts his hidden prey. He stops, studies...

               ERIN'S POV - LOW ANGLE LOOKING UNDER A CAR The Captain's
               feet, joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she
               left on the ground.

               INCLUDE ERIN

                                     SECRETARY
                         reproving herself as she turns
                         toward camera. She looks back under
                         the car, but...

               The Captain's feet have moved off. Where? She listens,
               hears nothing. Slips off...

               NEW ANGLE - ERIN takes refuge in the service area, crouching
               behind stacks of TIRES. Knife at the ready.

                                                                      82.


               The Captain's FOOTSTEPS audible.

               HER OBSTRUCTED POV between stacks of tires, the Captain,
               Glock at ready, PASSES BY, moving out of sight. Footsteps
               RECEDING. Then silent.

               ERIN Listening, neurons firing.  Cranes her neck to see.
               Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the
               stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...

               Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls,
               Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense
               on the trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (re: gun)
                         I know you too well. You won't do
                         it.

                                     ERIN
                         You don't know me at all.

               BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the
               gun, aiming just enough off that...

               THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a
               bloody mess. He starts advancing again toward her and Erin
               pulls...

               THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast.
               NOTHING.

               RESUME the Captain takes the gun from her. Shows her the
               CLIP he's carrying in his hand. Slams it into the gun.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         One in the chamber. That's all you
                         get.

               Erin SCREAMS as he drags her off now and...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               THE CROW flies UP toward the small entry window. Alex
               follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself
               up toward the windowledge.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP

               ERRRKKK. The SOUND of a car in a hurry audible as Alex
               hauls himself out the small window. Runs to the edge,
               spotting...

               FAR BELOW a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around
               the corner of the police station now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      83.


               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

               The Captain nervous at the wheel. He looks over his
               shoulder...

               Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle.

               INT. POLICE STATION - MYSTERY ROOM

               The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the
               carnage.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (crossing himself)
                         Holy mother of God. The devil
                         himself.

               He looks up, where Alex vanished. Starts to climb.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in
               sight...

               HIS MOVING POV partially obstructed, of the sedan below.
               Speeding around another corner now...

               ALEX alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a
               PARAPET where he totters over the vertical face as the
               sedan turning onto the street below.

               THE SERGEANT AND CREW emerge on the roof. Acquire target
               Alex Corvis.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Stop or...! Don't jump!

               WITH ALEX as he takes a flying dive off the building,
               intercepting...

               EXT. POLICE STATION - STREET #

               The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city.
               WAM!

               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WAM! ERRRK! The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely
               keeping control.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What the fuck?

               Erin perks up in the back seat. Battered. Ever hopeful.

               EXT. CITY STREETS #6 - DARK SEDAN

               WIDE. As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we
               see a HUMAN FIGURE standing on top of it, legs spread,
               arms upstretched.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      84.


               PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward,
               right THROUGH the glass moonroof.

               CRASH!  IN THE SEDAN the Captain horrified as Alex's hand
               yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the
               moonroof...

               ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the
               Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing...

               THE ZIGZAG PATTERN, THE MORTIFIED FLESH held in Alex's
               hand like the trophy it is.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. GARRISON'S PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Alex's voice appears. Calm. Unhurried.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         The Jolt, eight amps at two to
                         three thousand volts. It lasts a
                         few seconds. The current surges
                         and is turned off.

               FIND ALEX'S FACE in the darkness. Moving as he performs
               some unseen task. Intent, focussed.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         They wait for the body to cool,
                         then check to see if the heart is
                         still beating.

               FIND ERIN, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice.

               She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where
               the wounds are already healing.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         If it is... ba-boom, ba-boom...
                         another jolt is applied.

               SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         Experts say unconsciousness occcurs
                         before pain has time to register.
                         They agree electrocution does not
                         "hurt," could not hurt. But it
                         does. Unimaginably. Believe me.

               We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.

               The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the
               door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside.
               Alex looks at the phone on the wall. Silent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      85.


                                     ALEX
                         I don't expect a call from the
                         Governor. Any last words? Captain,
                         my Captain?

               REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin
               slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yeah. Fuck you.

               A long beat of silence.

                                     ALEX
                         Was that it? Well, ok.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I'm not dying for your goddamn
                         illusions. You got that? You think
                         you and your girlfriend had some
                         rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit.
                         She was already bored, why do you
                         think she was looking around? You're
                         nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

               A Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. The
               Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You can't do this to me you little
                         fucks!  I'll come back, just like
                         you, a big fucking shit spewing
                         bird and three guesses what little
                         bitch I'm taking out first...

               CLOSE. The switch thrown. ZZZZZTTT. PAN UP off the switch
               to...

                                     ERIN
                         You are so dead.

               She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair,
               starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with
               him at...

               THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into
               seething detail.

               Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that
               draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - DAWN

               Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow
               and the first rays of morning light.

               He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over
               his.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      86.


                                     ERIN
                         You want to get some breakfast?
                              (then)
                         What I mean is... I don't know how
                         this works, but...

               He stops, face to face now.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         In the woods you said you had
                         nothing. But you wouldn't, and I
                         wouldn't if there's some way you
                         don't have to go. Please. At least
                         not right away.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. I'll always be with you.

               For a split second, she's...

               LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off,
               it's...

               ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go.
               Then she spots something...

               ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone
               has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims."
               ERIN picks up the sign.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex. Look at this.

               She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it
               together as...

               CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls,
               with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which
               is alot.

               As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the
               sign, and starts to CRY.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         In that moment when Alex went...
                         wherever he went... when he made
                         that choice, I knew I was making a
                         choice too. To be alive. In the
                         world. And it made me cry.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN

               CAMERA FINDS Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm
               mercifully away from us. The CROW alights nearby, something
               in its beak.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      87.


                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         Maybe the world is a bad place but
                         the Captain gone has to be some
                         improvement. And that hope, that
                         tomorrow will be better, is enough
                         to keep me going.

               The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by
               Walsh's head. CAMERA keeps MOVING, FINDING..

               The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed
               and mute.

               Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES

               X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing
               the words we are hearing.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         When I think of Lauren fighting
                         and dying, it tears me apart, but
                         it also reassures me. That Lauren
                         and Alex were meant for each other.

               REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically
               transformed wild child.

               A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes
               that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         That they're together now. Fighters.
                         United by love. And anger. That
                         they've given also to me.

               She's leaning up against a new headstone.

               "Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."

                                     ERIN
                         I love Alex. As my sister always
                         hoped I would. And I love Lauren.
                         And I know, because of this, that
                         love does not die. I'm alive.
                         Thinking of them. Hoping that,
                         sometimes, they're thinking of me.

               Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes
               the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,
               like the one already over Lauren's.

               She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger
               to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.

               THE END
The Crow : SALVATION

               By

               Chip Johannessen



               OVER BLACKNESS.

               Silence. Broken by the faint clink of precision tools.
               Accurately, patiently wielded.

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               X-CLOSE. A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array
               of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady
               HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.
               Unhurried. Meticulous.

               A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,
               reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny
               feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the
               glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
               CROW. A taxidermy specimen.

               WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light
               of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of
               him. His identity yet to discover.

                                                          SLOW FADE OUT.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               X-WIDE. "THE WALLS" like a medieval castle above a throng
               of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS. A POSTCARD at first, then signs
               of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
               telegraph an imminent execution.

               The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES
               approaches, slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd.

               INSIDE THE BENZ NATHAN RANDALL, father of the victim
               comforts ERIN RANDALL, seventeen year old sister, as she
               looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car,
               the throng between the car and the prison entrance. The
               car stops.

                                     ERIN
                         Why are there so many?

                                     RANDALL
                         Just hold on to me.

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--a Protestor's poster visible.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of LAUREN RANDALL,
               the deceased, who bears a striking resemblance to surviving
               sister Erin. And another sign--"Happy Birthday Alex."

                                     ERIN
                         It's because they're doing this on
                         his birthday.

               She takes a deep breath, they get out of the car and...

               WITH THE RANDALLS as they make their way through the throng
               toward a special entrance marked "WITNESSES," nearly within
               reach when WHOMP.

               Erin shields her face as a BRIGHT LIGHT comes on. OVER TV
               REPORTER BARBARA GONZALEZ Action Newsteam addressing the
               Nathans. Speaking into a mic.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Mr. Randall. Sir. Do you think
                         this execution will bring you a
                         sense of closure?

               Nathan pushes past Gonzalez, taking Erin's hand.

                                     GONZALEZ (CONT'D)
                         Erin. Your sister...

                                     RANDALL
                         Leave us alone!

               The Reporter TURNS to the camera, not missing a beat.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         A difficult time for everyone
                         involved.
                              (then)
                         Interesting fact. It will take
                         about twenty-one cents of
                         electricity to execute Alex Corvis
                         tonight on this, his twenty-first
                         birthday.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a BIRTHDAY CAKE, twenty one candles flickering as
               it makes its way past deathrow cells, held waiter style on
               one hand by MERCER, a MUSTACHED prison GUARD.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLANG. The barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing
               on a small table next to a CHESS GAME in progress and an
               untouched last meal. ADJUST to find...

               ALEX CORVIS. Twenty-One today. Disarmingly appealing.
               Peaceful. Simple clothes. He looks up from the game, at...

               PETER WALSH, Alex's pro-bono attorney and only friend,
               trying not to explode at this shit-eating stunt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       3.


                                     WALSH
                         He didn't order that.

                                     MERCER
                         We found the man with the scar.

               Despite himself, Alex looks up. Mercer gestures at... THE
               CAKE in the middle of the candles, an arm made of frosting
               with a large ZIGZAG marking on the forearm, also frosting.

               FAVORING ALEX looking from the cake up to Mercer, who nods
               at the candles.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     WALSH
                              (intense whisper)
                         Get it out of here.

               Alex focusses on the chess board. Tries to anyway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               FLASH. The harsh Newsteam video light WHUMPS on,
               illuminating a WRINKLED OLD WOMAN.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Yes, I've come to a lot of these
                         over the years, but this one has
                         many unique aspects. Youth of the
                         condemned. That's unusual. Fifty
                         three stab wounds. Kind of a record.

                                     GONZALEZ'S VOICE
                         And Corvis still maintaining his
                         innocence.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, they all say that.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. A nervous, not to say shifty looking THOMAS "TOMMY"
               LEONARD, thirty five year old key witness in the trial,
               talks to Gonzalez under the hot video light.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't fault him saying I lied on
                         the stand. Facing the chair, you
                         do what you gotta do. But I saw
                         those two fighting that night.

               Tommy shifts uncomfortably, silent as we HOLD a long beat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       4.


                                     TOMMY (CONT'D)
                         I didn't lie.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A Chess piece, a CASTLE, shoved at CAMERA. ADJUST
               to INCLUDE ALEX.

               He breathes deliberately, trying to hold it together. His
               hand shakes as he removes it from the piece.

                                     WALSH
                         You ok?

               Alex gets up, crosses to a small ledge on the other side
               of the cell that holds a few books and pictures. He finds...

               A PICTURE OF LAUREN AND ALEX In a grove of tall trees. A
               self-portrait by autotimer. Arms around each other. Her
               head on his shoulder. Happy.

               RESUME Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         What's been holding me together is
                         the hope that maybe you do go
                         someplace. And I'll be seeing her
                         again soon. Only what will I say?
                         That I was too stupid to find the
                         guy who killed her? That he's down
                         here laughing?

                                     WALSH
                         Tell her... we'll get him.

                                     ALEX
                         We won't.

                                     WALSH
                         Someday he'll surface and I'll get
                         him for both of you. I promise.
                         I'll find the guy with the scar.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               FLASH. Four UNIFORMED COPS--DUTTON, ERLICH, LARKIN and
               TOOMEY--in the harsh news light.

               Erlich holds a CANE in one hand. Larkin and Toomey are
               twosie monkeys, smoking cigarettes with eerie simultaneity.

                                     ERLICH
                         This mystery man with the scar...
                              (indicates forearm)
                         ...the zigzag, whatever.

               Erlich gives a long-suffering look. Like it's preposterous.
               But he's too gentlemanly to say it.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         We couldn't find him. And,
                         obviously, the jury didn't buy it.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         Some people here seem to.

                                     DUTTON
                         People here are protesting the
                         execution of a kid just turning
                         twenty-one. A kid who had a tough
                         life. No parents, no dough. Always
                         had to fight for everything. It's
                         a tragedy, it really is. But I
                         don't see a single sign telling me
                         Alex Corvis is innocent.

               Look around. He's right.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex still gazing at the picture of Lauren. At the board,
               Walsh moves a piece.

                                     MERCER
                         I was facing the hot seat, I'd
                         want my attorney banging down the
                         door of the Supreme Court, not
                         playing board games. But maybe
                         that's just me.

               They look up as Mercer appears outside the barred door to
               the cell, starts to unlock it.

                                     WALSH
                         Your move.

                                     MERCER
                         No. It's time.

               It really is. Other prison personnel arrive outside the
               cell in various uniforms:

               A MINISTER with clerical collar, the WARDEN, two GUARDS.
               Waiting. Walsh crosses, very emotional how. Gives Alex a
               huge hug.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't want you to watch. I don't
                         want to give them the pleasure.

               The two friends exchange a long last look.

                                     MERCER
                         Ok. C'mon now...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       6.


               As Alex exits past Mercer, Walsh sits down on the cot.
               He's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips...

               THE CAKE against the wall where it hits, slides down, still
               semi-intact as it hits the floor.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW

               Dead Man Walking. A mini parade past the cells of the
               condemned. One guard flanks Alex, another follows. The
               Warden and Minister out in front.

               HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes. Unable
               to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity.
               Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side.
               Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW #2 - NIGHT

               The parade continues down another hallway.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The CHAIR, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the
               entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well
               choreographed last dance.

               The Warden gestures, and Alex is escorted to his place in
               the chair. The Guards move in, death attendants now.

                                     MINISTER
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
                         not want...

               THE MINISTER CONTINUES as...

               CLOSE. Handstraps tightened. WHOP. WHOP. Alex squirms
               despite his resolve. Through an act of will, calms himself.
               Looks up at...

               THE PHONE. On the wall. A last possibility of reprise.

               CLOSE. Trouser legs slit. Footstraps tightened around bare
               ankles. Electrodes checked.

               CLOSE. Chest strap tightened. Yanked again for good measure.
               ALEX gasps. It's hard to breathe now with the strap tight
               across his chest.

               CLOSE. Copper mesh. Pieces of sponge jerry-sewn onto it,
               the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural
               appearance.

               ADJUST to REVEAL this is the electrode in the odd leather
               HELMET tightened now on Alex's head.

               THE EXECUTIONER. Pulls a hood over his own obscured face.
               Moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room.

                                     MINISTER (CONT'D)
                              (concluding)
                         ... and I will dwell in the house
                         of the Lord. Forever.

               SLAP. The Minister shuts his bible. WIDER. Some weird sin.
               Alex strapped into the chair, unable to move.

               The guards exit, jobs done. The Warden nots and...

               ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PLEXI - THE OBSERVATION ROOM REVEALED
               as the CURTAINS OPEN.

               Two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a
               singlewide trailer. Erin. Her father. The Cops. Tommy
               Leonard. Gonzalez and other media types. Prison personnel.
               Every seat occupied. Sweaty and surreal. All looking at
               him. IN THE DEATH CHAMBER The Warden steps forward.

                                     WARDEN
                         Alexander Frederick Corvis. Do you
                         have any last words?

               A thick silence. Alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans
               a sea of hostile faces, settling on Erin and her dad.

                                     ALEX
                         I loved Lauren. I still do. I'm
                         innocent.

               Erin shakes her head, disgusted. Looks away.

               ALEX'S POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his
               inner perception, movement ramping down as Alex scans the
               disbelieving faces.

               The Phone. Silent. No reprise. The Observation Room witness
               door opens. A Guard in the back row deferentially offers
               his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL, a man in dark clothes, his
               face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass. As he
               UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff...

               The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the
               executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch.

               The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm,
               exposing a scar for Alex, THE SCAR, an odd zigzag pattern
               of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin.

               The Executioner throws the switch. ON ALEX SHAKING violently
               as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now
               as he chokes out...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (indistinct, filtered)
                         Murderer!

               The word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to
               Alex. Alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will
               trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       8.


               THE HELMET starts to smoke. Then a burst of FLAME at Alex's
               head.

               A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alex's struggle to see,
               to stay alive.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic, horrified.
               Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his
               shirt. Face always obscured.

               IN THE DEATH CHAMBER Alex in electro-spasm, smoke filling
               the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull
               the curtain closed.

               It JAMS partway across. ALEX expires in the char,
               grotesquely burned, EYES OPEN as the Warden finally yanks
               the curtain closed.

               IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The Scar Man slips out, but the
               rest remain, transfixed, horrified. Erin and others in
               tears. HOLD a long beat, their GASPS faintly audible.
               Then...

                                     MERCER
                         Cruel, who's to say, but it sure
                         was unusual.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Two guards push a gurney down a reverberant hallway far
               from the in-your-face security of deathrow.

                                     GUARD ONE
                         Look at this. Goddamn helmet melted
                         down.

                                     MERCER
                         That, my friend, is a deterrent.

               They WIPE past, Alex's charred remains visible a moment,
               parts of the helmet fused on his face and head, his body
               convulsed in a pugilistic attitude.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               The guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker,
               one of several. Mercer opens the locker door. The
               unceremoniously slide the body into the locker and...

               BANG. The body hits the open door. Convulsed as it is, the
               body won't really fit through the door.

                                     MERCER
                         Whoops.

               CRUNCH. The sound of something breaking as the SHOVE Alex
               into the cubby hole.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       9.


                                     GUARD ONE
                         Why do they even autopsy these
                         guys? Cause of death is pretty
                         fucking obvious.

               FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER. The door slams shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               CLOSE on the PICTURE of Alex and Lauren.

               ADJUST to include Walsh, looking at it. Pained. Still trying
               to understand. He secures it to the lid of the case already
               containing the neatly packed chess set. Closes it. Bows
               his head.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

               The protestors are gone, as is the Newsteam, but the four
               Cops are still there, Larkin and Toomey synchro-smoking.

               They look up as the Randalls emerge shaken from the Witness
               entrance.

               FAVORING NATHAN RANDALL He speaks softly to Erin, who's
               leaning against him.

                                     RANDALL
                              (to Erin)
                         I'll meet you atthe car, honey.

               She continues on and Randall crosses to the cops, who wait
               patiently to see what he'll say. Finally...

                                     DUTTON
                         We all wish this had ended better.
                         Sir.

               Randall nods. Like that's all anyone could say. As he walks
               off the Cops fall into easy chatter. CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CLOSE. A face slides into frame in PROFILE, too tight to
               be recognizable.

               Just an eye, peering...

               EYE'S POV - THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS A coarse ZIGZAG
               stitch shaped like the Scar runs the length of the Crow's
               underbelly. The end stitch now tied with a tiny knot.

               Tightened just so. THE MYSTERY MAN features obscured still,
               grabs a bent surgical SCISSORS, snips the excess thread.
               Smoothes black feathers into place, hiding the stitching
               on...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      10.


               THE CROW Finished. The Man gets up, leaves.

               CAMERA PUSHING on the Bird's head as we HEAR a door shut,
               still PUSHING on the glass eye that BLINKS now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE LOCKER. A human EYE BLINKS. Barely visible in
               the darkness. Alex KICKS with a YELL and...

               IN THE MORGUE.  The locker door flies open and Alex spills
               onto the floor. Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees
               before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive
               response. He cowers, looks up at...

               A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window,
               lands near him on the floor. It looks at him, then flaps
               its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. Follow
               me.

               ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought
               him here.

               HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in
               front of a mirror over the splash sink. It flies off,
               revealing Alex's reflection. Charred. Hideous.

               ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM. Turns, sees
               himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist...

               THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word "MORGUE," painted on
               the wall behind Alex, brought into focus at the center of
               the concavity. ALEX thrashes, trying to avoid his
               reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded.

               THE CROW flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. CAWING
               loudly, finally getting Alex's attention. ALEX settles,
               hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel.

               His body looks less misshapen now. He looks at his arms,
               hands, no longer burned. Pulls himself up on the gurney
               again, cautiously.

               OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second
               time, looks in the mirror. His body miraculously HEALED,
               covered by shredded clothing.

               His face obscured by the meltdown helmet. He slowly
               approaches the mirror on unsteady feet.

                                     ALEX
                              (to his own
                              reflection)
                         What happened?

               Alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first
               frightening FLASH as his fingers touch it...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      11.


               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - FLASHBACK A blitz return to his own
               execution. The copper screen, the helmet lowered into place.
               Electro-spasm. The faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen
               darkly.

               RESUME -ALEX clutching the helmet on his head, ripping it
               off in one painful OVERCRANKED movement and...

               OVER ALEX, IN THE MIRROR It's Alex, and yet not. His face
               marked with the Crow MASK, jagged WARPAINT where the melted
               helmet ran down his face. An indelible reminder of the
               botched execution. he stares at himself for a couple of
               deep breaths. Then WHAM! Shatters the mirror with a martial
               punch.

               THE FRACTURED MIRROR Alex's mask reflected in shards as
               his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass. His
               purpose unclear.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The Crow hops out into the hallway, flies toward us, lands
               with a CAW as Alex enters the hallway, framed against hight
               walls. His tentative movements growing more assured.

                                     ALEX
                         Follow the leader.

               The Crow flies off and Alex follows, to... A DOOR marked

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - "B-5" HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Empty. Bars at the far end spell seriously secure territory.
               Mercer moves cautiously up the empty hallway, stops as...
               The Crow hops out from a side hallway. Drawing him on.

                         Found our intruder. It's got a
                         beak and a death wish.

               Mercer pulls out his NIGHTSTICK, loses the bird as it hops
               back THROUGH BARS into...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

               Alex looks around his now empty cell. On the wall is a
               rectangle, clearer than the wall around it, where the
               photograph of Alex and Lauren had been before Walsh removed
               it. Alex goes up to thewall and touches the spot.

               FLASH! ALEX'S INTERNAL POV FLASH of LAUREN, laughing as
               she beckons to someone, Alex, who joins her in frame as we
               hear the whir of the camera auto-timer. A click, as the
               picture is taken. Alex and Lauren are frozen in the pose
               of Alex's photograph.

               RESUME The picture is gone. Alex, perplexed, stands looking
               at the blank spot on the wall for a moment. He turns and
               exits the cell...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

               Mercer is peering through the double-barred gate at the
               end of the row as Alex emerges from his former cell.

                         Now who the fuck are you?

               Alex looks up, sees Mercer and FLASH...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A pop of Mercer bringing the birthday
               cake. A wash of flame, twenty one candles. A blip of Walsh.
               Of a White King.

               RESUME Alex perplexed, looking at the cake still littering
               the floor of his ex-cell, candles melted down. Mercer works
               his way through the double-barred doors onto the row.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         And what have you done to your
                         face there beauty queen?

               The INMATE occupying the cell next to Alex's peers out
               through the bars, vanishes again as Mercer WHOPS the bars
               once with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX
                         It's my birthday.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      13.


                                     MERCER
                         Yeah, well... here's a present for
                         you.

               WHOOSH. Mercer swings his NIGHTSTICK at Alex's head. Alex
               catches it, instinctively in one hand. Mercer reaches for...

               A RED PANIC BUTTON hanging off his guard belt. Mercer slams
               it. FAVORING ALEX lets go of the stick, looks at his own
               hand, surprised.

               WHAM!  Mercer broadsides Alex's head with the stick. Alex
               goes down shocked, not from pain, from the fact that someone
               would attack him.

               WHAM WHAM WHAM. Mercer brutalizes Alex, collapsed at his
               feet as... TWO GUARDS enter the far end of the Row, race
               toward Alex's cell, one holding a TASER. Its LASER SIGHT
               finds Alex, crumpled in front of Mercer.

                                     MERCER (CONT'D)
                         It's ok. Man. Had me going there.

               Looks like it's over. The guards relax. ALEX suddenly looks
               up at Mercer. Zero damage from the blows.

                                     ALEX
                         Go ahead. Make a wish.

                                     MERCER
                         Taser!

               Alex wheels around as Guard One squeezes the trigger.
               CROWVISION The Taser Darts speed toward Camera.

               RESUME Alex shunts himself to the side and the TASER DARTS
               impale themselves in Mercer's thighs. He drops fibrillating.

               A CHEER goes up from the men in their cells, who become
               progressively rowdier as the guards BOLT and Alex follows,
               strength in his stride, nightstick in hand.

               Pieces of FLAMING TOILETPAPER flung now from the cells of
               Deathrow.

               AT THE FAR ENTRANCE the two Guards scramble to get the
               door closed behind them before Alex catches up. They'd
               make it except Alex hurls...

               THE NIGHTSTICK flying end over end like a throwing knife,
               catching the trailing guard in the back of the head,
               dropping him in the door, propping it open.

               ALEX enters the cage entrance to Deathrow, sharing the
               space with the Guard still standing.

                                     ALEX
                              (pats pockets, then)
                         Keys?

                                                                      14.


               The frightened Guard opens the door into the next hallway
               and bolts. Leaving the keys. The Crow hopping, screaming...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. Lit up like a
               Christmas tree now with flashing red lights. The Guard
               keys a communications radio.

                                     RADIO GUARD
                         Unauthorized movement in B five, B
                         six, C three, four, five...

               Another LIGHT goes on. They're starting to make a line.
               Buzzers going off now. A general ALARM sounded.

                                     RADIO GUARD (CONT'D)
                         Escape in progress. Heading for
                         the roof.

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               The Crow flaps up the stairwell. Alex on its heels, taking
               steps three at a time.

               AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL The Crow waits on a LANDING
               with a door marked "Emergency Use Only." Plus a dozen lines
               of assorted instructions. Guards' feet THUNDER below,
               approaching.

                                     ALEX
                         I hear the pitter patter of little
                         feet.

               He opens the door. The ALARM is LOUD.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Dark a moment. Then a HUGE SPOTLIGHT hits Alex, casting
               long shadows. He looks up at a GUARD TOWER, the source of
               the light. And of a BULLHORN VOICE.

                                     BULLHORN VOICE
                         Do not proceed. Back slowly away
                         from the fence.

               As if in defiance, the Crow hops toward the fence, old
               chain link topped with razorwire along the perimeter of
               the roof.

               BULLHORN VOICE CONTINUES as Alex follows... ALEX'S POV
               through the fence, down fifty feet to the pavement.

                                     ALEX
                         Damn.

               Alex turns, sees... A HALF DOZEN GUARDS emerge from the
               stairwell to the top of the roof, level weapons at Alex.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      15.


               ON THE FENCE - ALEX climbs quickly to the top, where he
               grabs two painful handfuls of razorwire that cut deeply
               into this hand. He extricates himself, balancing atop the
               fence. And looks...

               ALEX'S HANDS The jagged bloodlines disappear, miraculously
               heal.

               FAVORING ALEX as he holds up his hands to show the guards,
               a kid-like smile on his face.

               They respond by raising their weapons and BAM BAM BAM.

               Alex hurls himself off the edge in a hail of Gunfire that
               Dopplers down to silence as he falls, falls...

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Alex hits, flushing PIGEONS,
               that fill frame with manic wings.

               As the SPOTLIGHT sweeps toward Alex he rolls off, over the
               sidewalk, between two parked cars.

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               ON THE ROOFTOP Mercer and the others stand there dumbstruck,
               looking down as the SPOTLIGHT finds nothing.

               A RADIO CRACKLES. Mercer keys it a beat later.

                                     RADIO GUARD VOICE
                         Physical head count shows all
                         inmates present.

               Mercer moves the radio away from his head.

                                     MERCER
                         Then who was the fucking Houdini?

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

               AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Illuminated by spill from the
               Spotlight, Alex crouches between two cars. He leans forward,
               checking his reflection in a CHROME HUBCAP. A huge smile
               spreads over his face.

                                     ALEX
                         Happy birthday.

               He laughs. Life--or whatever this is--is good. So far.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The CROW flies past tall buildings downtown.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      16.


               EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               The crow flies past letters P-O-L-I-C-E on the side of an
               older building taking us to...

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               SMASH. A hand punches through a sash window, right through
               the imbedded security wires, roughly rips off the latch
               inside. Retracts, bleeding. The window opens.

               It's Alex, on the fire escape, checking out his arm as the
               BLEEDING STOPS.

               Alex follows the Crow into the dark room packed with file
               cabinets and evidence bins, wire lockers. And a desk, strewn
               with POLICE FORMS. Plus a vertical SPIKE with processed
               evidence request FORMS impaled on it.

                                     ALEX
                              (checking out desk)
                         Police? Evidence?
                              (then, to Crow)
                         Look. I like what we've got going
                         here. But I can think of lots better
                         to do with it than fighting crime.
                         Know what I mean?

               The Crow makes its way to a file cabinet, the top drawer
               marked "Cl-Cr."  Alex lingers a moment at the desk, eye on
               the spike.

               WHOP. Alex drives his hand onto the SPIKE. Looks up,
               delighted. CAW.

               The Crow gives Alex an admonishing look. Alex pulls the
               spike from his hand. Instant healing.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ok, ok... what?

               Alex opens the top drawer. Looking for... he's not sure
               what. Glibly goes through folders.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Nothing under "Crow."

               He stops. Pulls out the first FILE out in a thick section
               marked "CORVIS, ALEXANDER F." Having caught a glimpse of...

               IN THE FILE - ALEX'S MUG SHOT And rap sheet. X-CLOSE. We
               see "Murder 1st degree," "Penalty Phase: Find for
               Execution."

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Execution?

               But even this has little interest for him as the finds the
               words "Lauren Randall" on the page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      17.


                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (remembering)
                         Lauren...

               ALEX rips the drawer out of the file cabinet, dumps it
               CRASHING on the ground. He drops to the floor with a growing
               sense of dread, feeling with both hands, finding...

               A SPLAY OF PHTOGRAPHS encased in plastic -- the
               prosecutions' background presentation on Alex and Lauren.
               The first photo shows LAUREN Posing jauntily, her arm around
               a Snowman. She and the Snowman wear matching Boston Red
               Sox caps.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV On Alex, anticipating...WHAP!  A
               snowball nails him square in the face.

               WIDE to reveal LAUREN running for cover as Young Alex scoops
               up snow for ammo. He lobs a snowball at Lauren, just as
               she slips to the ground. she doesn't get up right away.

               Alex is just a shade concernec as he runs over to her. He
               reaches the spot to find LAUREN in the snow, waving her
               arms and legs to make a snow angel. She looks up at him
               and beckons him to lie on top of her.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What are you, an Angel?

                                     LAUREN
                         I'm your Angel. Come here.

               RESUME Alex's pained smile at the memory, until he finds:
               THE MURDER WEAPON A rough looking hunting knife bagged and
               tagged as "AC-005: Murder Weapon."

               ALEX frantic now, spreading out the file contents,
               finding...

               CRIME SCENE PHOTOS In a Grove of tall trees, Lauren
               Randall's stabbed and mutilated body, her neck slashed,
               head lolling sideways, melds with...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Brief glimpses of Lauren with Alex in
               the Grove, happy, like the still photo Alex kept in his
               cell.

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               RESUME Alex full-blown tortured now, throwing things.

                                     ALEX
                         No! I didn't...!

               Alex SMASHES his own head against the metal file cabinets,
               wounding himself on the handles, droplets of blood flying
               now, spattering the evidence on the floor.

               He reaches for the KNIFE, the murder weapon, to end the

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A tunnelvision pop of Tommy Leonard on

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               RESUME Alex shakes his head "no." Incredulous, horrified.
               The fury abating with a growing sense of mission.

                                     ALEX
                         You lie, you lie, you lie...

               Alex fishing through the detritus around him, finding...

               numbers, addresses. Alex's finger finds Eyewitness Thomas

               THE DOOR TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM opens.

               A YOUNG COP enters, walks slowly past rows of file cabinets,
               looking down empty aisles until finding the file drawerful
               Alex dumped. But Alex is gone.

               The Young Cop looks up as the Crow departs through the
               window and two other cops arrive. One of them Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         What the hell was that?
                              (then seeing mess)
                         Shit.

               Dutton walks to the mess on the floor, curious. He squats.
               Picks up a tag marked "Murder Weapon AC-005" staples ripped
               out, nothing attached to it. Takes in the crime scene photos
               of Lauren. Off the PIX...

               CAMERA DRIFTS down through dark trees FINDING Alex at a

                         I thought I'd be with you now.

               He's kneeling in front of a HEADSTONE. "Lauren Randall
               1982-2000. Always With Us."

               The Crow perched nearby. Camera circles Alex who looks up
               as the headstone WIPES through frame and...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV LAUREN NATHAN, a compelling sixteen
               year old, circles making an oddly sexy version of the "Oooo"
               Bruce Lee sound. A goof, a game she's playing with Alex,
               who circles opposite.

                         I'm not dead. And I'm not alive.
                         And I'm remembering. And it hurts.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV More goof kung fu, the circle closing.
               Lauren laughing more, searching for words.

                         I can't be alive. Not without you.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren's starting to crack up, trying
               to think of what comes next.

                                     LAUREN

               and she answers a question we never heard.

                         Only forever?

               RESUME OVER THE CROW. Camera stops circling. Alex looks up
               at the headstone, silent tears in his eyes as...

                                     ALEX

               A SINGLE BLOOD RED TEAR rolls down the cheek of the angel
               atop the headstone. Alex stops it with his finter.

               WIDER, the supplicant at the grave. And the Crow nearby.

               INT. MERCEDES - TRAVELLING - NIGHT - RAIN

               A GIRL'S HAND clutches a HEART SHAPED LOCKET.

               TILT UP, it's Erin, wearing an identical LOCKET around her
               neck. School uniform, pleated skirt and school books. The
               splish splash of the wipers the only sound until...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad...

               Nathan looks over. Sees she's holding the Locket.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I want to take this to Lauren.
                         She'd want it.

                                     RANDALL
                         Honey. I just can't.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay in the car. I'll only take a
                         second.

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin. I know you think she's been
                         talking to you.

                                     ERIN
                         It's not that. Really. It's just...
                         now that he's gone, I think it's
                         time.

               Off her dad...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               The Benz stops on the roadway beneath Lauren's grave. The
               door opens...

               ERIN gets out in the pouring rain pulling her jacket HOOD
               up over her head. Locket in hand she runs to...

               LAUREN'S GRAVE The tree a shelter from the downpour.  Erin's
               approaching the headstone when Alex emerges from behind
               the trunk. Drenched. She YELPS.

                                     ALEX
                         It's ok. I'm not going to hurt

                         Don't come near me!

               He holds his hands up, compliant. She doesn't bolt. But
               she's ultra-cautious. Like with a snarling dog.

                                     ALEX
                         I was a friend of your sister's.

                                     ERIN
                         I know her friends.

                                     ALEX
                         That locket you're holding. You
                         have one just like it.

               She lifts the Locket around her neck. Visible to anyone.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, no kidding.

                         And he's right over there by the
                         way.
                              (then)
                         What did you do to your face?

                         Someone else did it.

                                     ERIN
                         You're a friend of the guy who
                         killed her, aren't you? You almost
                         sound like him.

                                     ALEX
                         He didn't kill her.

                                     ERIN
                         How do you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I know everything about your sister.
                         I'll prove it to you.

                                     ERIN
                              (loud now)
                         Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!

               OS, the car door opens. Then SLAMS shut. Nathan approaches.

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin!

               She whips around, points at... Alex is gone.

                                     RANDALL
                         What were you yelling about?

                                     ERIN
                         This guy said he was a friend of
                         Lauren's. He had like paint all
                         over his face.

                                     RANDALL
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         What's that supposed to mean? He
                         was right here. He was!

               She shakes her head, confused, then, looking around spots...

               THE HEADSTONE. The track from the RED TEAR indelible even
               in the downpour.

               Off Erin, as she touches the angel's stained cheek. And
               her dad, soggy in the rain...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - RAIN - NIGHT

               A street LIGHT flickers on. Maybe because night has fallen
               or maybe its just a rainy day.

               Thomas Leonard hikes up his collar, trying to stay dry, as
               he pauses a clutch of hookers huddled in a doorway...

                                     HOOKER
                         Yo, Tommy. Red light special.

                         Even you can afford it.

               He shakes his head--don't need that grief--continues on to
               the next building and CAMERA FINDS...

               ALEX watching, holding "The List." He crosses off the name
               for Eyewitness "Thomas Leonard."

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Tommy clears the stairs, heads for his door. Unlocking the
               second lock, he looks around, alert, like he heard
               something. Then opens the door.

               INT. TENEMENT - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Alex waits for Tommy, crouched by an OPEN WINDOW that looks
               out onto an alley, a four story drop.

                                     TOMMY
                              (sees Alex, then)

                         Sssshhh. She's resting.

                                     TOMMY
                         Where the fuck did you come from?

                         Big bang, primordial ooze, divine
                         hand of a benevolent creator?  All
                         possibilities. Although recent
                         events have given me doubts about
                         the benevolent creator.

               Tommy starts toward Alex, who pulls the KNIFE from the
               Evidence Room.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You lied at my trial.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't know you, man.

                         Exhibit A.

               WHAM. Alex pins what looks like Tommy's arm. It's just his
               jacket, but it immobilizes Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids
                         arguing. A guy and a girl.

                                     ALEX
                         You said you saw me with this. I
                         never held it until today.

                                     TOMMY
                         What's your damage, man? Corvis
                         hacked up that girl like a
                         motherfucker.

               Alex HEAVES Tommy crashing into the window, smashing the
               glass and cheap aluminum frame.

               Tommy hanging halfway in, halfway out. Four floors above
               the alley. Alex rips Tommy's shirt where the knife already
               cut it. JACKS the sleeve down. No scar there.

                                     ALEX
                         One chance to tell the truth, Tommy.
                         Who is the man with the scar? He
                         planted this in my car.

                                     TOMMY
                         There's no scar. Corvis made it
                         up.

                                     ALEX
                         Wrong. Answer.

                         Who are you?

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Tommy!

               TOMMY'S WIFE enters from the bedroom, SCREAMING.

               Heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. OS, a
               TODDLER CRIES as she throws herself on Alex and they spill
               back inside.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE (CONT'D)
                         Let him go! Let him go!

                         Honey. Take the baby. Get out of
                         here now!

               But she doesn't leave. She pleads in wrenching SOBS that
               seem to affect Alex. The Crow lands in the window.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         He's all I got. Tommy and the baby.
                         Don't take him. The baby needs a
                         father.

               Her MASCARA runs down her cheeks, a facsimile of Alex's
               mask. They share a long look, connected by pain.

               The Crow cawing a warning, hopping in the window as...

                                     ALEX
                         Your baby is crying. Go.

               Tommy nods at his wife, who heads off to the bedroom. The
               Crow gives Alex an admonishing CAW, then takes flight.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         They showed me pictures, what he
                         did to her. Evidence. Said all I
                         had to do was stand up there and
                         not my head "yes."

                                     ALEX
                              (repeats, insistent)
                         What did they give you?

                                     TOMMY
                         A job. Construction. Twelve an
                         hour.

               Tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old BOY.
               Alex unfolds "The List," passes it to Tommy, blank side
               up.

                                     ALEX
                         Write down their names. All of
                         them.

               But Tommy takes a look at "The List" and flips it over...

               "THE LIST" Tommy points to the Police Witness list. Dutton,
               Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

                                     TOMMY
                         You already got 'em. Right here.
                         These cops said the needed an
                         eyewitness, or Corvis would walk.

               ALEX drops his head. All clear now. He laughes gently at
               the sound of SIRENS approaching, still blocks away.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the by now familiar Mystery Man, bent
               over his work at the table across the room.

               CLOSE. A lineup of short (2") rods. One selected with a
               pair of surgical forceps,

               INSERTED through a hole in human flesh, raising a
               considerable welt. Some bleeding.

               As the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty
               STAND among the taxidermy specimens. Marked "Corvus
               brachyrhynchos."

               He scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands,
               shielding his face as a Crow flies out of the darkness,
               right at him.

               The man turns toward Camera but we never see his face as
               the Crow wheels mid-air, flying past him a second time. As
               the Crow flies up and out a SMALL WINDOW, the man stands,
               hands on the desk. SLOW PUSH on the man, on...

               A ZIGZAG PATTERN of raised welts on the underside of his
               forearm, in high relief under the Draftsman's lamp.

               The "Scar." A drop of blood zigzags, running downward.
               SLOW FADE OUT. OVER BLACK, the CRACKLE of a Police Radio.
               We're...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. A police CRUISER has stopped a late model
               CADILLAC SEVILLE on a deserted street.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      26.


               IN THE POLICE CAR CLOSE. COP I.D. "Dutton, Philip" with a
               picture of the same face CAMERA FINDS working a bad comb-
               over in the rearview mirror.

               IN THE SEVILLE TRACY, almost sixteen, dressed for nightlife,
               sees Dutton primping in her rearview mirror. He's getting
               out now.

                                     TRACY
                         Oh no...

               She jostles her friend JANNIE, passed out in the front
               passenger seat, trying to rouse her. No luck. DUTTON motions
               and Tracy buzzes down the window.

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                         Anything wrong?

                                     DUTTON
                         Let's hope not. License and
                         registration please.

               Tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks
               through her purse. Not finding anything.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         What's with your friend there?

                                     TRACY
                         She's... sick.
                              (off Dutton)
                         Actually she never had Mai Tais
                         before.

                                     DUTTON
                         But you, you've had them.

                                     TRACY
                         Not tonight. Honest.

               Tracy paws through her purse some more. Vamping.

                                     DUTTON
                         If you had a license, I bet I'd
                         have seen it by now. How old are
                         you? Fifteen?

                                     TRACY
                         Look, I'll tell you the truth.
                         Jannie drove us and was supposed
                         to drive us back, she has a license,
                         but I mean... look at her.

               Dutton leaves that dangling. Circles around to the passenger
               side...

                                     TRACY (CONT'D)
                              (whisper to Jannie)
                         Get up, get up...!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      27.


               Dutton opens Jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between
               her slightly parted legs. Dutton smiles at Tracy.

                                     DUTTON
                         Why don't you get out.

               CROWVISION High overhead. Tracy steps out of the car. Dutton
               shuts the passenger door, points. Tracy moves behind the
               Seville.

               RESUME Dutton closes in. She's getting very nervous.

                                     TRACY
                         You want me to walk a straight
                         line?

                                     DUTTON
                         I want you... to bend over.

                                     TRACY
                         Look, can I just call a cab?

                                     DUTTON
                         What did I say?

               Tracy bends over the car trunk. Dutton eases her feet apart
               with the tip of his boot then pulls out his NIGHTSTICK,
               uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt. As
               he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no."

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Maybe I'll ask your friend.

               Tracy's frantic, about to call out as Dutton moves to the
               passenger door, opens it and...

               OVER DUTTON - ALEX sits in the passenger seat now. Jannie
               shunted inward.

                                     ALEX
                              (mimicking Dutton)
                         I want you... to bend over. Officer
                         Dutton.

               Dutton pulls his 9MM BARETTA on Alex.

                                     DUTTON
                         Where'd you come from? Out of the
                         car. Now!

               With insolent slowness, Alex finishes writing...

               "THE LIST" a red line drawn through Dutton's name.

               ALEX gets out of the car. Dutton SLAMS the door and Janie
               stirs, coming to. At least a bit.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Hands on the car.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      28.


                                     ALEX
                         Question. These hands?

               Alex advances on Dutton.

                                     DUTTON
                         You're dead, ditch weed.

               CLOSE. Dutton's finger squeezes the trigger.

               BAM! The shot blows Alex back at the Seville passenger
               window. Slumped face against the car.

                                     TRACY
                         Omigod, omigod...

               Jannie's head pops up inside the car. She SCREAMS at...

               JANNIE'S POV Alex right in her face, nice and dead. Dutton
               lowers his gun BG. Tracy in a panic. Suddenly, Alex opens
               his eyes, smiles.

               Face distorted against the glass. She screams again.

                                     ALEX
                         You're up.

               ALEX wheels around, wrenches Dutton's wrist, vise gripped.
               Dutton's gun falls to the ground.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Ladies. Drive carefully.

               Tracy rushes to the driver side.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You might want to call 911. Report
                         an officer down.

               Tracy SCREECHES off leaving Dutton in shock.

                                     DUTTON
                         That was a fucking hollow point!

                                     ALEX
                         I guess it's true. Guns don't kill
                         people...

               Alex draws the KNIFE--the murder weapon--from his costume.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think maybe knives do?

                                     DUTTON
                         Keep that thing away from me.

                                     ALEX
                         This is not just some "thing."
                         It's A C zero zero five.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      29.


                                     DUTTON
                         You're the skel broke into the
                         evidence room.

               FLASH. The knife moves and RIP! Alex yanks the sleeve off
               Dutton's uniform, revealing a SCARLESS FOREARM.

                                     DUTTON (CONT'D)
                         Fuck! What do you want?

                                     ALEX
                         A scar. On the arm. Of the man who
                         planted this in Alex Corvis's car.

                                     DUTTON
                         There's no scar, you freak. The
                         Corvis kid made it up.

               Alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then RAMS Dutton
               into a wall with a great CLATTER of trash cans.

               Alex all over him, holding Dutton's head firmly in his two
               hands, like he could crush it in an instant.

                                     ALEX
                         He was innocent. You framed him.
                         You. And Erlich. And Larkin. And
                         Toomey. What do you think, Officer
                         Dutton? An eye for an eye?

               Alex's thumbs inch toward Dutton's eyes, grazing Dutton's
               eyelids now and a wild thing happens.

               FLASH!  ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Dutton's Nightstick lifts
               Lauren's skirt.

               Then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, Lauren's death. And
               the surprise BAM! of a shot fired.

               RESUME Alex thrown by this. Relaxes his grip on Dutton.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You were there. All four of you.

               Dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over Alex's
               back then pulls a SMALL SEMI-AUTO from an ankle holster.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You killed her. I saw it.

                                     DUTTON
                         Bitch killed herself when she shot
                         a cop in the leg. If she' just
                         acted like a girl nothing would
                         have happened.
                              (then)
                         So you're right, spooky. Happy?

               BAM! Alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, Dutton
               starting to panic. BAM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      30.


               Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. Pointed right at
               his face, then...

               WHOOSH. Alex flips it around, RAMS the gun in Dutton's
               mouth. He couldn't talk if he wanted to.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm working on it.

               BAM! We HEAR the blast as we... CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               BAM BAM continues, but these are TOY GUNS, fired in synch
               with POUNDING MUSIC.

               In the hands of TWO STRIPPERS. Topless, leather G's and
               chokers, black stockings, POLICE HATS on their heads, law
               enforcement stars for earrings.

               The CAPACITY CROWD responds as they pout, wield their
               weapons.

               AT THE ENTRANCE - MADDEN a straightfaced plainclothes
               detective, more upscale than the clientele, flashes a BADGE
               at a BOUNCER who scowls, lets him pass.

               WITH MADDEN circumnavigating the mainstage, where the cop-
               strippers are waving handcuffs now. At the edge of the
               room, LAP-DANCERS pull one-on-one's for twenties. Madden
               exits...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               BACKSTAGE Madden moves past girls in various stages of
               undress. Smoking, yapping, waiting to go onstage. One looks
               up, interested, but he doesn't look back, exits into...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               AN INTERNET PORN FACILITY Where "live" sex workers man
               tiny fantasy sets--a Dungeon, a Shower, a desk and
               blackboard meant to suggest a Schoolroom. Crudely built,
               but good enough for 500x800 pixel resolution. Madden stops
               a second, looking...

               OVER A MONITOR - THE DUNGEON SET UPDATES every six seconds,
               the slowly changing low-rez version of the action on the
               set--a woman tied to a chair with bright surgical tubing.

               The picture refreshes and BG, the woman sneaks an expertly
               timed sip of Diet Coke, puts the can away before the picture
               updates again.

               A COUNTER shows 132,768 hits and climbing. Madden gives a
               look, like people are really fucked up, continues past a
               curtain with a "No Admittance" sign into...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      31.


               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               A BACK HALL dark, the furthest recesses of the building.
               Madden continues cautiously toward... A DOOR

               INT. THE HOLE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door is cracked open. Madden moving very quietly now,
               scowling as he peers through the slight opening.

               Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money.
               Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach.

               The door flies open.

                                     MADDEN
                         Police!

               A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze.
               Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.

                                     ERLICH
                         You fuck. Don't do that.

               It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey. Three cops we met at the
               execution. Erlich's cane nearby.

                                     MADDEN
                         How's the month end?

                                     ERLICH
                         Oh yes. Never been better.

                                     MADDEN
                         Where's Dutton?

                                     ERLICH
                         Probably parked near some high
                         school with a hardon. Fuck never
                         showed.

                                     MADDEN
                         Anyone at all curious why?

               Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look. Madden goes to
               one of the money counters and grabs...

               A STACK OF TWENTIES tossed violently at the ceiling.

               Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like
               leaves, picking them up.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         You leave the door open with two
                         hundred strangers out there!  What's
                         it take for you guys to learn a
                         goddamn lesson?

                                     TOOMEY
                         No one saw anything, Mad.

                                     MADDEN
                         You know why Dutton's not here?
                         Rigor mortis! He's dead.

               The Three exchange looks.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         One shot to the head, then fifty
                         three stab wounds with a six inch
                         blade. Any deja vu here? Think
                         Corvus knife, missing from the
                         evidence room.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Since when?

                                     MADDEN
                         Since last night. As usual, you're
                         right on top of things.

                                     LARKIN
                         It was supposed to end when Corvis
                         died. Remember? The kid no one
                         would miss?

                                     ERLICH
                         Don't look at me, asshole.

                                     LARKIN
                         Hey, I didn't kill anybody.

                                     ERLICH
                         Back off. I mean it.

                                     MADDEN
                         Shut up! Erlich and Larkin settle
                         down.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck.
                         Every reporter in town's trying to
                         get a look at Dutton's body. I
                         suggest we get a line on this before
                         someone else does.

                                     LARKIN
                         Who'd give a shit about Corvis at
                         this point? Kid didn't have a friend
                         in the world even when he was alive.

                                     ERLICH
                         I can think of one.

               Erlich and Madden share a look. On the same wavelength.
               Erlich picks up his weapon off the table.

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               A large CRIME SCENE marked off by tape, Dutton's cruiser
               where he left it. Several other cruisers nearby, lights
               flashing. An ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now.

               AN ACTION NEWSTEAM the one we've seen before, Barbara
               Gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for
               us to hear.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a TV. Gonzalez audible now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         ... rumors multiply as officials
                         refuse to confirm or deny reports
                         of multiple, multiple stab wounds...

               Gonzalez CONTINUES UNDER as...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad! Come in here!

               The SOUND of footsteps racing down the hall.

                                     RANDALL
                         What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         The cop who found the knife in
                         Corvis's car.

               Randall riveted by the TV now.

                                     GONZALEZ
                         They're moving him now, body
                         covered. It would appear that thirty
                         seven year old Phillip Dutton is
                         dead in the line of duty...

               ON THE TV the Newsteam and Gonzalez SHOVED back by COPS
               running defense for the stretcher. Gonzalez grabs for the
               sheet covering the body and...

               NEWSCAM TIGHT on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially
               uncovering...

               DUTTON'S HEAD: Comb-over hanging to the side. Blood dripping
               from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word
               "DAISY."  Quickly covered by a COP who yells at Gonzalez...

                                     COP
                         Out of here! Now!

               ... but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has
               been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez.

               RESUME - FAVORING ERIN struck dumb by this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      34.


                                     GONZALEZ
                         Shocking even for these mean
                         streets, the word "Daisy" apparently
                         cut into his head by the
                         perpetrator, still at large. A
                         name. Perhaps a message...

               Gonzalez FADES UNDER as Erin backs away from the TV.

                                     RANDALL
                         What? What is it?

                                     ERIN
                         Lauren called me that when we were
                         little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

                                     RANDALL
                         Honey. It's doesn't mean anything.
                         It's not a message.

                                     ERIN
                         That guy in the cemetery today
                         said he knew everything about
                         Lauren.

                                     RANDALL
                         It still doesn't mean...

                                     ERIN
                         He said he'd prove it.

               Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful...

               EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

               WIDE. The ambulance drives off, lights flashing, and we
               BOOM UP over the crime scene, over the Newsteam, revealing
               the top of Dutton's cruiser, marked with a BLOODRED CROW.

               Continuing upward, FINDING... The Crow, perched high on a
               building. It takes flight.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick
               building, peers down over the edge.

               Camera DRIFTS DOWN the side of he building finding a light,
               someone burning the midnight oil.

               FINDING a CHESS SET mid-game near the open window as...

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               WAM! Erlich's CANE knocks a pile of papers to the floor
               off a desk piled high with briefs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      35.


                                     WALSH
                         I don't know about any knife. I'm
                         trying to forget that case.

                                     ERLICH
                         Well someone isn't. They killed
                         Dutton.

                                     WALSH
                         It wasn't me.

                                     ERLICH
                         No shit. You couldn't get close to
                         him. But I'm betting you know who
                         did. Who's into Corvis? Huh?

               Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor,
               then picks up a PHONE LOG off the desk.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         Not a lot of calls. Business slow?

               He tosses the phone log out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               HIGH ANGLE. Watching the phone log fluttering down.

               INCLUDE ALEX, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing
               Dutton's badge on his evolving costume.

               Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         You're the only one gave a flying
                         fuck about him when he was alive.

                                     WALSH'S VOICE
                         Lauren Randall did.

                                     ERLICH'S VOICE
                         Hey. Bitches are crazy. Richer
                         they are, crazier they get.

               "THE LIST" The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by
               Alex.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly
               by the collar.

                                     WALSH
                         Maybe if you hadn't fried an
                         innocent kid...

                                     ERLICH
                         Who is it?

                                                                      36.


                                     WALSH
                         How about the real killer. You
                         think of that?

               Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the
               window, falling by the chess board.

                                     ERLICH
                         If you're covering for someone,
                         that's jail time. I got my eye on
                         you.

               Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. Walsh starts
               to get up, stops. Looking at his own eye level...

               ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's
               cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the
               board. Walsh pulls it out.

               It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop
               Five. Smiles. Looks at...

               THE PAPER UNFOLDED says "Check." Walsh sets it down in the
               Chess Box next to...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN arms around each other in
               the woods, smiling.

               WALSH sensing something, a presence.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back.
               Nothing. He leans out the window.

               EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               CROWVISION: Starting on Walsh, popping his head out the
               window two stories down, INCLUDING Erlich as he exits the
               building, gets in a SILVER PORSCHE.

               Picture bending wildly as the Porsche takes off and the
               Crow takes flight.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. The Porsche pulling to a stop.

               IN THE PORSCHE Erlich looks down, presses a button on the
               stereo. Elvis from his baroque period "If I can Dream."
               Erlich looks up, waves his arms.

                                     ERLICH
                         No, no...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      37.


               ERLICH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD A BUM starts to
               "clean" the windshield with an OILY rag, leaving opaque
               smears on the once clean glass.

               THUD. A handful of gravelly MUD lands on the windshield,
               starts to get smeared around. ERLICH pounding the window
               from inside.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         No! Shit!

               The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment.
               Hard to see anything now. Erlich throws up his hands in
               disgust, reaches for the door handle just as...

               SMASH!  The driver side window SHATTERS as something enters
               at high speed KICKING Erlich across the car...

               Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a
               BLOODY SMEAR. Alex in the driver seat now.

                                     ALEX
                         The Germans really know how to
                         make a car, don't they?

               LOW ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE wheels spinning as it peels out.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WINDSHIELD WASHERS and WIPERS clear away the grime Alex
               smeared on the windshield, revealing that we're rocketing
               through a bad part of town.

               MUSIC CONTINUES as Alex pulls the KNIFE out of his costume
               with his LEFT HAND. It looks huge in the cramped sports
               car.

                                     ALEX
                              (re: Lauren knife)
                         I heard you were looking for this.

                                     ERLICH
                         You're the guy killed Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         I want you to think of me as the
                         guy who killed you.

               Erlich pulls a .380 SEMI-AUTO stashed between the two seats.
               Points it at Alex.

                                     ERLICH
                         Stop the car.

               Alex FLOORS it and... BAM.

               Erlich blows a hole through Alex's LEFT ARM, a yawning
               aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery
               a few improbably seconds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      38.


                                     ALEX
                         Ow.

               The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.

                                     ERLICH
                         Fuck. Me.

                                     ALEX
                         What happened to your leg there
                         Officer? Hunting accident?

               WHOP. In one swift move Alex impales the knife THROUGH
               ERLICH'S WRIST, into his thigh. Erlich SCREAMS, tries to
               remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Lauren Randall shot you trying to
                         get free. The fifty three stab
                         wounds she died of came from you.
                         Am I right? Ballpark?

               Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as...

               EXT. CITY STREET #2 - NIGHT

               The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light.

               A POLICE CRUISER going the other way pulls a stunt U, flips
               on its lights. In hot pursuit.

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic.

                                     ALEX
                         In Saudi Arabia they cut off the
                         hands of petty thieves. What price
                         for a life? Two lives?

               FLASH. Alex yanks the Knife out and FLASH, slices through
               the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the FLESH.
               Erlich's arm bleeding.

                                     ERLICH
                         Not my arm! What you fucking want?

                                     ALEX
                         I want Lauren. I want my life back.
                         I want... to know why.

                                     ERLICH
                         Why? Why's anything happen? It's
                         all money, man. Money. The girl
                         just got in the way.

               Alex grimaces, then RIP, he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's
               arm. Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      39.


                                     ALEX
                         The scar. Which of you has it?

                                     ERLICH
                         Nobody.

               Alex poises the knife for another descent.

                                     ERLICH (CONT'D)
                         I swear. It's a bullshit fucking
                         story the loser boyfriend made up.

               This gives Alex pause. He shakes his head, clearing the
               reality glitch, looks up...

               IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR Cop cars, lights flashing.

               EXT. CITY STREET #4 - NIGHT

               The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final
               straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side
               of an overpass.

               The cops not far behind. The Porsche bottoming out on a
               bump now ant...

               INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt. He
               reaches to push it back into position and notices...

               ON THE BACK OF THE VISOR The CAR REGISTRATION. Alex takes
               it out of the holder. RESUME Alex suddenly calm. He reaches
               down for...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER pushed in. The volume on the Elvis
               song pumped up. ALEX relaxes back in his seat as they scream
               toward the abutment.

                                     ERLICH
                         Are you out of your fucking mind?
                         We're going to die.

                                     ALEX
                         How can you die if you're already
                         dead?

                                     ERLICH
                         You're him. Corvis.

                                     ALEX
                         I was talking about you.

               Alex smiles as the CIGARETTE LIGHTER pops out. He grabs it
               and the GLOW vanishes as he closes his fist around it.

               Erlich turns front in horror. The microsecond of terror
               realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      40.


                                     ELVIS
                         My dream... comes true... right
                         now!

               EXT. OVERPASS / ABUTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! The Corvette hits at a million mph. Crumpling,
               disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the
               abutment.

               THE CAVALRY - CRUISERS AND PLAINWRAPS Too late. A half
               dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. Screeching
               to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche.  The ruptured
               gas tank spurting GASOLINE.

               A CRUISER screeches to a halt. Both doors fly open. Toomey
               and Larkin step out. Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks
               up the embankment, catches a glimpse of...

               ALEX battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still
               holding the Lighter, glow fading.  He tosses...

               THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER arcs down onto the ex-Corvette. WIDER -
               BOOM!  Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes
               in a huge FIREBALL that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close
               by.

               IN THE TOO-CLOSE COP CAR the DRIVER rams the car into
               REVERSE. Tires squeal as the fireball hits and...

               THE TOO-CLOSE CRUISER Engine compartment ignites, a second
               fireball racing backward into another Cruiser. BOOM!

               Total chaos now. LARKIN focussed on Alex, seen vaguely
               through the flames. Moving toward him.

               WITH LARKIN as he arrives at the top of the enbankment,
               draws his weapon. Hyperalert. Alex is gone, but he finds...

               ERLICH'S BODY two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises.
               Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist.
               It's...

               "THE LIST" Dutton and Erlich crossed off. Larkin and Toomey
               yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all
               contained in a VERTICAL OVAL, "DELT" circled in red.

               LARKIN, AS TOOMEY JOINS HIM They give each other an oh-
               shit look. Then Larkin checkes his fingertips, smeared red
               from...

               "THE LIST" - FLIP SIDE the CROW CIPHER, rendered thick in
               coagulating blood. Illuminated by the flickering light of
               the fire below.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A heart shaped Locket swung gently back and forth,
               then closed in Erin's hand as CAW!

               Erin turns, sees the Crow perched on the window ledge. As
               she moves to the open window, the Crow flies off.

               ERIN'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW - THE CRASH SCENE far away,
               the flashing lights and sirens of fire trucks arriving to
               bring the fire under control.

               ERIN looks, wondering, then spots something closer to hom.
               She moves off, WIPING through frame REVEALING...

               ON THE FRONT LAWY Alex. He looks down now, at the front
               door where...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin exits the front door and we see her framed against
               the huge house, a rich-man's castle built in the twenties
               of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass.

               Erin, like her sister, a child of privilege. She approaches
               Alex.

                                     ERIN
                         Daisy. How did you know?

                                     ALEX
                         I told you, I knew your sister.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed that cop Dutton.

                                     ALEX
                         And another one. There. Erlich.
                         Took a wrong turn.

               Alex points at the distant crash site, the vague flashing
               lights.

                                     ERIN
                         I know who you are.
                              (no response)
                         That's why you paint your face. To
                         hide.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm not hiding. I'm right here.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed Lauren! You killed her!

               Erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on,
               then RUSHES ALEX, screaming, beating on him, fists of fury.

               Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic.
               He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting.
               He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I've been shot, and stabbed and
                         thrown from a car and none of it
                         hurt. But what you're doing now,
                         does. I don't know why.

                                     ERIN
                         My dad was right! He said you'd
                         ruin her life.

                                     ALEX
                         No. Listen to me. Lauren found out
                         something they didn't want her to
                         know.
                              (then)
                         This.

               He holds up a Card, the Registration from the Corvette.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         From the bonfire over there. Look
                         at it.

                                     ERIN
                         No! Why are you haunting me?

                                     ALEX
                         Because you need to understand.
                         And you need... to be careful.

               He tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the
               card through the air. She turns, watching its flight all
               the way to the landing by the front door...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry. Your father wasn't right.

               She turns back and...

               He's gone. Erin walks to the door. Despite herself reaches
               for the Card on the landing. It's...

               THE CORVETTE REGISTRATION which we see clearly for the
               first time. Owned by a company called DELT. The address is
               4201 Forestview Drive.

               ERIN spins around horrified, holds up the Registration.

               THE ADDRESS ON THE REGISTRATION - 4201 FORESTVIEW matches
               the numbers two feet away from her--the address plaque on
               her own house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ROLL CALL BULLPEN - DAY

               The buzz of nervous COP WALLA settles out as a stocky
               SERGEANT #2, clueless but honest, raises his voice, trying
               to command attention.

                                     SERGEANT#2
                         Listen up! Yo! We got a cop killer
                         out there.

               Walla responds "no shit"--and CAMERA BOOMS UP, moving to
               the back of the room over a nervous sea of blue uniforms.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         Til we get an I.D. treat everyone
                         like a suspect. Patrol assignments
                         are posted by the door. Read them.
                         No singles, it's the buddy system
                         til we catch this asshole.

               Sergeant #2 CONTINUES UNDER as CAMERA FINDS...

               FAVORING LARKIN, TOOMEY AND MADDEN huddling together at
               the back. Urgent whispers. Larkin and Toomey try to contain
               their panic.

                                     LARKIN
                         He knows. I saw him. Fucking zombie
                         mask.

                                     MADDEN
                         Calm down.

                                     LARKIN
                         You calm down.

               Larkin takes out "The List" from the crash site.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Whose name's fucking next? Not
                         yours.

                                     TOOMEY
                         You didn't testify. You're not on
                         the list.

                                     MADDEN
                              (flips it over)
                         Scary guy. Not only survives that
                         crash, but takes time out for art.

               He pockets "The List." Then looks up as...

                                     SERGEANT#2
                         Madden! Hey!

               The entire room looking back at the three renegades.

                                     SERGEANT#2 (CONT'D)
                         The old man's requested the pleasure
                         of your company.

               Madden shakes his head like this is bad news, rises and
               leaves.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

               A SECRETARY mans a LOW COUNTER guarding a large door at
               the end of the huge empty hall. She's got a heavy mascara
               trailer park vibe, looks up from her eyelash curler at the
               sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS.

               HER POV - THROUGH THE EYELASH CURLER Madden approaches.
               Stops. THE SECRETARY smiles, hits a BUTTON under the
               counter. The door to the Captain's office swings open.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Glad I'm not you.

                                     MADDEN
                         Right back at ya.

               She checks out Madden as he moves past her, then puts the
               eyelash curler away in a NAILIT containing a couple of
               razor sharp SCALPELS.

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

               No sunlight in this cavernous, wood-panelled office. The
               Captain obscure in skifts of shadow at the edge of the
               room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sit down.

               Madden sits.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I thought we had an understanding.
                         I thought we understood that
                         discretion is paramount.

                                     MADDEN
                         Yeah, we do.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Shut up.

               Madden does. The Captain begins and intense slow burn.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      45.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Erlich gimping around in his goddamn
                         hot rod is not discreet. I've got
                         reporters asking me how much he
                         made. I've got the entire force
                         looking at this case now.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know.

                                     MADDEN
                         I know the guy leaves a sign.

               Madden produces "The List," flips it over to show the Crow
               doodle in blood.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No shit he leaves a sign. He's a
                         goddamn Picasso.

               The Captain slaps down a crime scene photo--the Crow
               emblazoned huge on the top of Dutton's cruiser.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What else do you know? Do you know
                         this?

               The Captain SLAMS a file down in front of Madden, who lets
               things cool out a moment before looking at it.

                                     MADDEN
                              (reads cover)
                         Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in
                         the Corvis case.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Some hooker phoned it in. There
                         was a riot at his apartment
                         yesterday.

                                     MADDEN
                         Guy dressed for Halloween?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Good for you. You do know something.

               They look up as the Secretary enters, holding the door
               open, like it's time to leave. Madden starts to speak and...

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't say. Just do. Before it all
                         comes tumbling down.

               The Secretary gives Madden a look as he exits, then joins
               the captain who's standing...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      46.


               BY AN AWARDS CASE holding glass bowls and trophies presented
               to the Captain over the years for Civic Service.

               The Secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he
               looks at his loot.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Idiots.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Sssshhhh.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You're the only one who makes it
                         go away.

               As he turns toward her embrace, CAMERA ADJUSTS to point up
               something we may have noticed...

               IN THE CASE - A STUFFED BIRD, on one of the glass shelves.
               CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - NIGHT

               CAMERA CREEPS toward the large stone house. A light comes
               on at one end of the lower floor, shining through the
               window.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Erin works at her father's desk under the light of an
               antique floor lamp. Using a LETTER OPENER to PRY open...

               A DESK DRAWER full of files. She flips through, finds a
               manila file marked--DELT. Takes it out. ERIN lays the file
               open on the desktop.

               EMPTY. She checks...

               A SMALL PAPER SHREDDER under the desk. Judging from the
               paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used.
               ERIN scoops up the shreds of paper. No way to reassemble
               this.

                                     RANDALL
                              (trying to be casual)
                         What are you doing there?

               Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches.

                                     ERIN
                         I think I dropped an earring.

                                     RANDALL
                         Looks like you have them both on.

               She jumps up as her father reaches the desk, keeps her
               distance. He spots the empty DELT folder, closes it.

                         Alex Corvis didn't kill Lauren.
                         Cops did. Didn't they?

               No response.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You're in with them.

                                     RANDALL
                         It's not what you think.

                                     ERIN
                         You killed her!

                                     RANDALL
                         No.

                                     ERIN
                         Stay away from me! Stay away!

                                     RANDALL
                         Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.

               Erin SCREAMS, runs out the door with her hands over her
               ears. He misses a beat, then RUNS after her.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Nathan catches up with her as she frantically grabs CAR
               KEYS out of a dish by the front door.

               He grabs hold of her arm, she struggles, CLAWS at his face
               to get loose. Squeaks out the door onto...

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               Erin runs to the far side of the big Benz, parked in the
               driveway. Tries the door. The ALARM goes off.

                                     RANDALL
                         They killed her because she found
                         out.

                                     ERIN
                         About you.

                                     RANDALL
                         About them. You've got to leave it
                         alone.

               ACROSS THE STREET, A PORCH LIGHT comes on. Erin hits a
               button on the key ring, CHIRP CHIRP. It stops.

                                     RANDALL (CONT'D)
                         Sweetheart...

                                     ERIN
                         Don't call me that! Don't call me
                         anything!

                                                                      48.


               A NEIGHBOR opens the door, peers at them from across the
               street. Inquisitive.

                                     RANDALL
                         I would never hurt you or Lauren.
                         Never. Believe me.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't believe you.

                                     RANDALL
                         Please. Come inside.

                                     ERIN
                         I'm never going back in that house
                         again. Get away.

               He edges away from the car, reluctantly. She starts to get
               in, anger giving way to extreme sadness.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (crying now)
                         They killed Alex for something you
                         did, daddy. You killed both of
                         them.

               She gets in the car. Starts it. ERRRKKKK! She peels out
               backward down the driveway.

               SLAMS the car into Drive and tears off down the street.
               The Neighbor shakes her head at Nathan, goes back inside.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               WHAM! Thomas Leonard bounces off the wall, drops to the
               floor.

               A FEMALE FIGURE wipes through frame, throws herself on
               Larkin, who's roughing up Tommy.

                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         Please! Leave him alone!

               Larkin backhands her sprawling to the floor, where she
               crawls to the WAILING BABY, takes him in sheltering arms.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'm not making this up. He had a
                         crow with him.

                                     LARKIN
                         Caw, caw, that's what you're telling
                         me.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said I lied at his trial. It's
                         Alex Corvis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      49.


                                     LARKIN
                         So we're talking... a ghost. With
                         a pet bird.

               Tommy nods.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Turn down that fucking baby!

               The baby's gets quieter as the mom rocks it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Get up, Tommy. I want to show you
                         something.

               Larkin helps Tommy to his feet. Places "The List" on the
               table. Then RAMS Tommy's face down on top of it.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         You see that? My name's next on
                         his list. It's fucking next.

               Larkin hauls Tommy back upright. Dazed.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         So who is the guy, Tommy?

                                     TOMMY
                         Corvis. It's...

                                     LARKIN
                              (cutting him off)
                         Take your time. Think before you
                         speak. Cause at this point I got
                         to hear something besides the crap
                         you're been spewing.

               KA-CHUNK. Toomey cycles his 9mm. Everything dead silent.

                                     TOMMY
                         He said the whole trial was a setup.
                         That I caused an innocent kid to
                         die. Is that true?

               Larkin grimaces. The only question is how to end this.

               EXT. TENEMENT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               Madden stands by a plainwrap ,calmly SMOKING.

               A SCREAM above. He looks up to see CRASH!

               Tommy's BODY breaks through a window four floors up and
               falls with broken glass, landing by Madden who rubs his
               temple a second, then calmly grinds out the butt.

               INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Tommy's wife horrified, pleading, as Toomey raises his
               weapon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      50.


                                     TOMMY'S WIFE
                         No, please...

               Her voice stops mid-sentence as BAM.

               The baby still crying as Toomey takes aim again, then lowers
               his weapon, starts to leave the room with Larkin. At the
               door, Toomey turns and BAM!

               The crying stops.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A diminished field of Chess Pieces. ADJUST to include
               Walsh, scrutinizing the board.

                                     WALSH
                         Alex?

               He looks out the window a second. Then scans the room again.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         C'mon. I'm talking to my myself
                         here. It's humiliating.

               Walsh goes back to the board, makes a move.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Check and mate.

                                     ALEX
                         Dream on.

               Walsh looks up. Nothing. Then Alex steps from the shadows.
               Walsh looks at him a long moment, sees through the makeup.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. It's really you under there.

               The two guys look at each other a long moment, cross the
               few steps to hug. Walsh blown away.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         I'd like to say you're looking
                         good, but...

               Walsh leans in, examines Dutton's BADGE on Alex's costume.

                                     ALEX
                         Two down. Two to go.

                                     WALSH
                         "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.

                                     ALEX
                         The cops from my trial. They killed
                         Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                              (off Walsh)
                         You think I'm crazy.

                                     WALSH
                         I'm thinking... that explains a
                         lot.

               Walsh sits down. Disturbed.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren's father's involved. He
                         bought the cops fancy cars, I don't
                         know what else. It's a company
                         called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren
                         found out.

                                     WALSH
                         What do they do that they had to
                         kill her?

                                     ALEX
                         I was hoping you'd find out.

                                     WALSH
                         Yeah. I sure will.

               They both turn as the Crow lands in the window, CAWS.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                              (at the bird)
                         Boo!

               The Crow flies off. Walsh goes to the window and looks
               out.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         What's the deal with this bird.
                         It's been hanging around. Alex?

               He turns toward Alex, who's gone. A double take as Walsh
               gets it, whips around, looks out the window again. CUT TO:

               EXT. REMOTE ROAD - FOREST - NIGHT

               Far above a solitary car winding through an old-growth
               forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness.

               The Crow soars into frame, watching.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               A simple WOODEN CROSS illuminated by the headlights of the
               Big Benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge
               trees dripping with moss.

               IN THE BENZ Erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving
               the headlights on. Silence.

                                                                      52.


               WITH ERIN as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross.
               Partway there...

               CAW! Erin looks up, finds the Crow fluttering in to perch
               high overhead. Alex emerges from behind a tree, near the
               cross.

                                     ALEX
                         This is where it happened. Right
                         over here.

                                     ERIN
                         Yeah, I know.

               She stays where she is. Alex quiet, affected by the place.
               Erin's about to lose it.

                                     ALEX
                         Are you ok?

                                     ERIN
                         When Lauren was missing the police
                         came to our house. They said they
                         were looking for her, right?
                              (breaking down)
                         But I know now they had her, and
                         the reason they brought her here
                         and knew the could blame it on
                         you...

                                     ALEX
                         No...

                                     ERIN
                         ... is that I sent them here. I
                         told them she came here sometimes.
                         With her dirtball boyfriend. That's
                         exactly what I said.

               She's crying softly. He draws nearer.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. It's not your fault.

                                     ERIN
                              (losing it now)
                         It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish
                         I were dead.

                                     ALEX
                         No. You don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Yes I do, I really do.

               Seeming to lose patience, Alex lunges at her, like an
               attack.

                                     ALEX
                         There were four of them.

                                     ERIN
                         No...

               He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring IMAGES
               that shake them both.

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Jolting FLASHES.

               A Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now.

               A hand slams the car into Park. Doors open. Four men get
               out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

               Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat,
               her hands cuffed in front of her.

               Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         Four large men. And still...

               Lauren stumbles into Erlich, grabs and BAM! FLASH!

               He takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered
               weapon.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         She grabbed one of their guns. Got
                         off a shot, then ran, ran for her
                         life.

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin's covering her face, like trying to
               avoid seeing some horrible thing.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to know.

               Alex grabs Erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly,
               like a three legged race. Tracing the path Lauren covered.

                                     ALEX
                         She ran. Them breathing down her
                         neck...

               Erin stumbling as Alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of
               them running toward a large tree, MATCHING to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands
               hindering, tree limbs hitting her face.

               Her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her
               heels.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         ... all the way from the road to
                         this tree...

               RESUME - PRESENT Erin still trying not to see. Alex forcing
               her.

                                     ALEX
                         This tree. Here's where it happened.

                                     ERIN
                         I don't want to see!

               Alex spins her up against the tree and we MATCH to...

               ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter
               destined to lose. Her movements UNDERCRANKED, strobed.
               Discontinuous and jarring.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         She turned and faced them and went
                         down kicking and punching and
                         fighting them, fighting death as
                         they stabbed her and stabbed her.
                         Fifty three times.

               The brutal cops overwhelm Lauren. She drops to the ground
               as...

               RESUME Erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs.

                                     ALEX
                         She fought for her life because
                         life is worth living.

               Alex panting. Fierce.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Think about that. And then tell me
                         how much you wish you were dead.

               Off Erin, sobbing, heartbroken. Alex's fury waning as he
               looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Armed men and barbed wire. The Spotlight FLARES and we're...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               An odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall.
               Mercer escorts Madden, the Captain, and the Secretary who
               hangs on her bosses arm, gawking like a tourist.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Why wasn't the incident reported?

                                     MERCER
                         Nothing to report. All inmates
                         were present and accounted for.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         So you pretended nothing happened.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      55.


                                     MERCER
                         Hey, Corvis fried. I don't really
                         see how it could be him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No. I wouldn't expect you to.

               They all enter...

               INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

               Mercer goes to the locker where he left Alex.

                                     MERCER
                         Be forewarned. Nature takes its
                         toll.
                              (opens locker)
                         Bon appetit.

               The all look inside. The locker is empty. Mercer's the
               only one shocked. He noisily opens and shuts the other
               lockers looking for Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You lost him! Now lay off the
                         fucking doors!

               Mercer stops, backs off, gives the power trio some space.

                                     MADDEN
                         They botched the execution.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Could say that.

                                     MADDEN
                         Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard
                         was right.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Maybe you were a little harsh on
                         him.

               They watch now as the Secretary moves, drawn to the mirror.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         Babe?

               She's looking at... T

               HE FRACTURED MIRROR. Shards of glass selectively removed
               forming, we see now, a CROW.

                                     MADDEN
                         Fucking crow.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Sign of the dead come back to life.

               Madden turns, not comfortable with the concept.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      56.


                                     MADDEN
                         How about sign of a big black bird?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The dead can return, given
                         sufficient motivation. And Corvis
                         has that.

                                     SECRETARY
                         This guy David Jenkins came back
                         as a ghost because my uncle owed
                         him four dollars. Followed him
                         everywhere. Ruined his life.

                                     MADDEN
                         Time out. You really saying he's
                         back from beyond?

               The Secretary nestles into the Captain, who whispers in
               her ear. He nods.

                                     MADDEN (CONT'D)
                         Cause if you're losing your mind,
                         I got a right to know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He's looking for something. Won't
                         stop until he finds it.
                              (then)
                         Sometimes the best way to get rid
                         of someone is to let them have
                         what they want.

                                     SECRETARY
                         The man...

                                     ALEX
                         ... with the scar...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

               WIDE. Erin sits cross-legged in the HEADLIGHTS of the Benz.
               Alex perches Crow-like on the hood.

                                     ALEX
                         ... took everything I ever cared
                         about. Left me with nothing.

                                     ERIN
                         So you're going to kill him?

                                     ALEX
                         Have to find him first.

               He closes his eyes. Pained at a memory.

                                                                      57.


                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You know what Lauren and I were
                         fighting about that night? She had
                         a secret, wouldn't tell me...

                                     ERIN
                         My father.

                                     ALEX
                         All I knew, she was pulling away.
                         It made me crazy.

                                     ERIN
                         I used to be so proud of him. My
                         big deal daddy. And now, he's just
                         a crook. Worse even. And the weird
                         thing is...

               She fights back tears. Gains strength.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I wish I could hate him but I can't.
                         He said he'd never hurt either of
                         us, and I know it's true and...
                         I'm going back.

                                     ALEX
                         It's what Lauren would do.

               Erin nods, takes the Locket off her neck.

                                     ERIN
                         I want to forget. Forget what I
                         know. Forget myself. Forget
                         everything.

               She winds up to toss the Locket away and Alex hops down
               off the hood. Stops her. Takes the Locket. ALEX

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (re: Locket)
                         Keep it. Because it connects you
                         to Lauren. And it connects you to
                         me.

               He fastens the Locket back around her neck. A covenant.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         No matter what happens I'll make
                         sure everyone knows. That you're
                         innocent. That you loved her. I
                         promise.

               CLOSE. Erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket.
               Dumps it on the ground. Finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among
               the containers.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't want to be me anymore.
                         Make me like you.

               Erin's face blasted WHITE by HEADLIGHTS.

               She closes her eyes as Alex begins the first bold lines
               around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light,
               she could be...

               LAUREN opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again.

               WIDER. Alex paints Erin's face in the Benz headlights, the
               two of them kneeling in the forest-cathedral.

               Camera creeps BACKWARD, leaving the two of them connected
               by ritual. And touch. And a promise to each other.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. RANDALL'S HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. A mess of documents. Nathan nervously writing,
               assembling a tell-all at his desk.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You know it doesn't work this way.

               Nathan gets up. Tries to subtly herd the Captain off.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm out of this.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Partnerships don't end like that.
                         Friendships don't.

                                     NATHAN
                         Our friendship ended when Lauren
                         died.

               The Captain circles to the desk now, past Nathan.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?
                         Because there's a ghost threatening
                         us.

                                     RANDALL
                         You mean Alex.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I mean Lauren.

               The Captain flips through some of the papers on the desk.
               Frowns. He closes a file folder.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Because you never accepted that
                         what happened to her was an
                         accident.

                                     RANDALL
                         You killed my daughter.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         An accident, Nathan.

                                     RANDALL
                              (exploding now)
                         She was eighteen years old! There
                         were four of them. They stabbed
                         her fifty three times! Where's the
                         fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is
                         it?!

               Nathan furious. The Captain keeps a preternatural calm.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I watched her grow up. Just like
                         you. I know how her mind worked.
                         She kept snooping around because
                         she was worried about you. What
                         you'd gotten yourself into. So
                         stop blaming me. And blame yourself.

                                     RANDALL
                              (beat, quietly)
                         I do. Every day.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Erin knows, doesn't she?

               This catches Nathan off guard. He starts to say something.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Don't even bother. You never were
                         a good liar.

               The Captain flips through the papers on the desk again.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Look at this. Everything we worked
                         for. You tell me... what are we
                         going to do?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

               HEADLIGHTS approach from down the street. The Big Benz
               pulls into the empty driveway.

               Erin alone in the car, her mood tough to judge in the Crow
               mask.

               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

               Erin enters, steels herself. Then she calls out...

                                     ERIN
                         Dad?! You home?

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                                                      60.


               INT. RANDALL HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER. Erin plunges her masked face into the wash
               basin in this white-tiled bathroom.

               ANGLE - ERIN A few SLO-MO DROPLETS cascade off her face
               into basin as she scrutinizes herself in the mirror, wipes
               off the mask.

               CAMERA INCHING forward...

               She listens up. Grabs a Towel to blot the water on her
               face. We begin to hear with her...

               DRIP. DRIP. DRIP...

               She tightens the sink faucets. The sound continues DRIP
               DRIP as she moves to...

               THE CLAWFOOT BATHTUB Faucet not dripping, but the sound is
               louder. DRIP DRIP. Erin grabs the shower curtain, whips it
               back REVEALING...

               NATHAN RANDALL behind the tub, face a mask of gore, blown
               off point blank by the BLOODY HANDGUN on the tile next to
               him. ERIN screams.

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE. The Chess set. A few pieces moved off the board
               now. Alex not looking at it. He's looking at the picture
               of himself and Lauren taped in the lid of the Chess box.

                                     WALSH
                         It's like a bowl of spaghetti. D-E-
                         L-T is owned by Westwind Builders,
                         Nathan Randall's company. But DELT
                         in turn owns a dozen other
                         corporations. A big mess to wade
                         through, so I checked out Tommy
                         Leonard.

               Alex picks up the BLACK KING.

                                     ALEX
                         Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't
                         matter. I want the King.

                                     WALSH
                         We're getting there. Because in
                         his so-called construction job,
                         Tommy makes a daily delivery to a
                         place called "The Hole."

                                     ALEX
                         The strip joint?

                                     WALSH
                         I believe they call it a
                         connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.

               Alex places the picture of himself with Lauren back in the
               box of chess pieces, against the open lid.

                                     WALSH (CONT'D)
                         Places like that, they're about
                         unreported cash, processing money
                         from drugs, prostitution.
                              (then)
                         I took a chance, called asking for
                         Larkin and Toomey, the two other
                         cops. Whoever answered said "they're
                         not here...
                              (meaningfully)
                         ... this is the front office."

               BAM BAM BAM.

               They look up. A shadow banging on the door. Leaving BLOODY
               SMEARS on the outside of the frosted glass.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex!

               Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood
               smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         They killed my dad.

               It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion.
               She throws herself into his arms.

                                     ALEX
                         It's ok, it's ok...

                                     ERIN
                         It's not. I can't take it.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. Who?

                                     ERIN
                         I don't know. I found him lying
                         there.

               Alex immobilized by this. He turns to Walsh.

                                     ALEX
                         Where is it? This place?

                                     WALSH
                         I think we should get some support?

                                     ALEX
                         What? Call the police?

                                     ERIN
                         What is this? Where are you going?

               Alex waiting for an address. Finally...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      62.


                                     WALSH
                         1315 Berkeley Street.

                                     ERIN
                         Don't leave me. Please.

               Alex turns to her, comforting. Holds her face in his hands.

                                     ALEX
                         It will be over soon.
                              (then)
                         Watch out for each other.

               He heads off and we PRE-LAP sexbomb death metal POUNDING...
               CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               More debauched than our previous visit. Darker, more
               crowded.

               Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely
               eighteen. The room writhing.

               ON THE MAINSTAGE the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but
               dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a
               handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them.

               AT THE ENTRANCE Alex blows past people waiting to get in,
               creating enough disturbance that TWO BOUNCERS greet him.

                                     ALEX
                         Toomey and Larkin. They're expecting
                         me.

               The Two Bouncers give each other a look. One points to a
               SIGN on the wall: "You must be 21..."

                                     BOUNCER
                         I need to see some I.D., pal. Circus
                         in town?

               The Other Bouncer grabs Alex as he pushes past. Alex heaves
               him into the line of WAITING PATRONS.

               As they go down like dominoes... the First Bouncer pulls a
               GUN.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't think you want to do that.
                         Lot of innocent people here...
                              (looks around)
                         A lot of people, anyway.

               As Alex starts off... BAM! He's blown back by a shot half
               lost in the noisy club. No panic yet.

               ONSTAGE the strippers break character, looking. The audience
               turns as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      63.


               NEAR THE ENTRANCE The First Bouncer goes flying above the
               heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic SHOT while
               airborne, inducing...

               PANDEMONIUM Patrons stampeding as BAM BAM!  Alex taking
               bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit. The Bouncers
               out of sight underfoot.

               ON ALEX visible again, back on his feet. Buffeted,
               stationary as everyone flees. With the exodus still at
               flood stage...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               ON WALSH, in motion as he puts on a jacket, throws some
               papers into a briefcase. He's nervous, ill-suited for this
               cloak and dagger stuff, chattering...

                                     WALSH
                         We'll be safe in my car. Nobody
                         will recognize it. Let's move yours
                         in back, no, down the block. Hope
                         it's nothing fancy. There's a chop
                         shop around the corner.

               She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly
               opened. The Captain stands there. Somber reptile. Holding
               a sheaf of papers in one hand.

                                     ERIN
                         You followed me here.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         No... Erin, I put out a bulletin
                         on your car because... there's bad
                         news. And I thought you should
                         hear it from me.

               She stares at him expressionless.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Your father got involved with some
                         bad cops. On my force, so I take
                         responsibility.
                              (beat, then)
                         He killed himself.

               She talks with great difficulty.

                                     ERIN
                         How?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         How did he kill himself?

               She nods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      64.


                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         With a gun. Is that what you mean?

                                     ERIN
                         No. I mean... how did he kill
                         himself How do you figure he killed
                         himself--with a gun, right--when
                         it wasn't anywhere near where you
                         found him?

               He takes a step toward her. She pulls out the Blood Pistol.
               Seems crazy enough to use it.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         You killed him.

                                     WALSH
                         Erin. Don't.

                                     ERIN
                         Back the fuck off! Now!

               The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward
               her, onto Walsh's desk.

               The papers Nathan was preparing. Walsh looks at them
               while...

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He left this. Names, addresses, a
                         note to you. These people he was
                         involved with killed Lauren. He
                         couldn't bear it anymore.

                                     WALSH
                         My God. He's right, it's all here.

                                     ERIN
                         The note. Show it to me.

               Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's
               hand. The Captain inches forward.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                              (to Captain)
                         Not you!
                              (to Walsh)
                         Show it to me.

               The Captain steps forward, right to the desk. Erin backed
               into a corner now.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         It's right there, under that paper.
                              (grabs a note)
                         Here. Look.

               She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the
               situation for one second as she reads...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      65.


               THE NOTE A bunch of numbers added together in her father's
               hand. Not a suicide note.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs Erin's wrist and BAM!

               A chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. The
               Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the
               trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You were always the stupid one.

               She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers,
               wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now. BAM!

               WALSH blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board. Trying
               to pull himself up. Erin struggling. As...

               MADDEN enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.

                                     MADDEN
                         You need help?

               He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hurry. We don't have much time.

               BAM. A shot from Madden drops Walsh for god. As Madden
               drags Walsh toward the door, the Captain grabs...

               THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN pulled off the lid of the
               Chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. The
               Captain exits.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               MUSIC STILL POUNDS, lights swirl. But the club has cleared
               out, leaving human detritus, a handful of casualties from
               the stampede.

               WITH ALEX as he steps over the Two Bouncers, expired on
               the floor.

               A soft WHIMPERING marks the silence.  The girl cuffed
               onstage. Alex goes up to the terrified girl.

               Close up, she looks way underage. He gathers her clothes,
               spots a key on the floor.

                                     ALEX
                         How old are you?

               She listens as he unlocks the cuffs.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         You have one chance to value your
                         life. Take it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      66.


               He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still
               half naked. As she leaves...

               THE CROW appears in the doorway near the broken bodies.
               Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts.

               The casualties. CAW. The Crow flies on, disappearing into
               the back rooms. Alex turns, follows...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               Alex moves past the empty makeup table. A lipstick cigarette
               smolders in an ashtray. People left in a hurry. MUSIC LOUD,
               as if inside our heads now. Alex continues...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

               Nobody home. Empty images refreshed every six seconds.
               Number of hits static now. Alex drawn now by the "No
               Admittance" Curtain which he approaches slowly, touching
               it and FLASH!

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN looking over her shoulder,
               pulling back the "No Admittance" Curtain, going where she
               shouldn't go.

                                     ALEX
                         Lauren? You were here?

               Lauren makes her stealthy way into....

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

               revealed as Alex slips past the Curtain, retracing Lauren's
               footsteps. CAMERA FOLLOWS Alex CREEPING down the hall to...

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN down the hall, peering inside
               the partially open Back Room door, then turning back
               startled TOWARD CAMERA as if suddenly overtaken.

               AT THE DOOR Alex turns back, like Lauren, looks behind
               him. The hallway is empty. He enters...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a LIGHTER
               FLARES. Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch.

               Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots
               of eyes. Not taxidermy specimens.

               BAM BAM BAM BAM.

               A dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges
               into Alex in an angry, STROBING fusillade. In the silence
               that follows...

                                     LARKIN
                              (after the fact)
                         Don't move.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      67.


               The gang LAUGHS. Larkin makes his way to a light switch by
               the door.

                                     LARKIN (CONT'D)
                         Drinks are on me.

               Larkin flips on the low-watt BARE BULBS hanging down past
               industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the
               cinderblock space.

               NO ALEX.

                                     ALEX
                         Cheers.

               They look up and... BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to
               the forehead. BAM!

               He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around
               him. Alex scampers across framing as...

               The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to
               near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's
               fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots
               Toomey, rolls out as...

               THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM!

               Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls
               onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend
               himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank,
               more advancing cops. While...

               TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs
               out the door on hands and knees while...

               A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As
               the echoes dissolve...

               Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check
               the body...

               THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened
               properly.

               The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds
               another nameplate underneath. "Hauser."  Heads off in search
               of...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Toomey!

               INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when...

                                     ALEX
                         You dripped something!

               Toomey panics as he approaches...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      68.


               INTERNET FANTASY SETS Monitors still updating every six
               seconds. Toomey hears Alex coming, slips through the
               "Dungeon."

               BEHIND THE SHOWER FANTASY SET Toomey takes refuge out of
               sight, next to a GAS HOT WATER HEATER, quiet as a mouse.
               ALEX tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its
               rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see...

               THE DUNGEON MONITOR Toomey (frozen) scurrying through.
               Gone now as the monitor updates. Then Alex appears,
               following him through the set...

               WITH ALEX moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's
               heels. WAM. Toomey hits him full force with A PIPE, sending
               Alex sprawling backward, COLLAPSING the flimsy Shower set.

               WAM. Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with...

               THE GAS LINE to the water heater ripped out by the blow.
               HISS. The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks.

               RESUME Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to
               get his gun pointed in Alex's face. Hissing gas nearby.

               CLICK. Toomey cocks the gun.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Spark, gas... bad combination. And
                         it's not this leak here, that's
                         the least of your worries.

               WAM! Alex swings Toomey's pipe HARD at a much bigger GAS
               LINE right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked.
               The hiss magnified 100% nos.

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         We're going to play a little game
                         called "Who's got the Scar."

                                     TOOMEY
                         What Scar? What fucking scar?

                                     ALEX
                              (buzzer sound)
                         AAAANK. That's not how we play the
                         game.

               Alex jacks Toomey's sleeve down. No Scar. Alex pissed as
               Toomey locks eyes with him. Really seeing him now.

                                     TOOMEY
                         You're him! You're Corvis! We fried
                         your ass. You're dead, man!

                                     ALEX
                         Good thing in a situation like
                         this.

               We pick up...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               Some light filters in as a door opens to the outside. A
               FIGURE enters, squats among the bodies. He leans in, closes
               larkin's eyes, and we see...

               It's Madden. Blood on his hands. He hears Alex's VOICE
               faintly, then Toomey cries out in pain. Madden moves
               toward...

               INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

               Madden creeps down the hallway to the back room. VOICES
               growing louder.

                                     TOOMEY
                         Fucking Zombie.

                                     ALEX
                         The scar.

                                     TOOMEY
                         There is no scar. I'm telling you.

               As Madden moves toward the conversation, his face registers
               the slightest of smiles.

               MADDEN'S CREEPING POV MONITORS obliquely visible as he
               reaches the end of the hall by the Fantasy sets. The
               "Shower" monitor shows Alex and Toomey, visible through
               the trashed set, updated every six seconds.

               MADDEN SNIFFS gas. The HISS now audible along with Alex's
               voice. Madden smiles. Pulls out his 9mm.

               And BACKS UP, away from the Fantasy Sets toward the back
               room. Madden takes aim at...

               THE FIRST MONITOR The images is Alex threatening Toomey.
               Updating now--LOSING ALEX on the Monitor as he steps into
               frame in person, looks up and BAM!

               CROWVISION a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and...

               ANGLE - GROUND ZERO as the bullet hits the monitor in a
               shower of sparks, followed by...

               BOOM! A ROILING FIREBALL Seems to vaporize Alex before
               flying down the hallway right at CAMERA.

               Madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows
               him into the back room with a deafening roar.

               EXT. "THE HOLE" - INFERNO - NIGHT

               BOOM! Windows blow out in a gas fired inferno. A body flung
               out the rear door. BOOM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      70.


               EXT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

               Interior/exterior being less meaningful than seconds ago.
               Walls crumbled, roof blown off.

               BRIGHT FIRE consumes the frame, consumes the bodies of
               downed cops, consumes every last bit of oxygen and life.
               Distant SIRENS draw closer.

               A SLOW SCAN, someone's OBSTRUCTED POV of Hell.

               INCLUDE ALEX watching from under a collapsed cinderblock
               wall that offers some protection from the flames, if not
               the heat. He looks, intent now, spotting...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION sticking out of the
               rubble, murky through the flames, growing clearer as camera
               PUSHES, flames licking at it...

               ALEX tries to move toward the arm. Forced back by too-
               intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts
               and...

               THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION skeletal now, baked
               down to bones. A dozen short metal rods on the ground under
               it. He picks a few up. THE CAPTAIN drawn now to...

               UNDER THE RUBBLE - WHERE ALEX WAS water dripping off the
               concrete, collecting in the place where Alex hid. But he's
               long gone. The Captain drops the rods. Satisfied it's over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET #5 - NIGHT

               Alex staggers along in bad shape. Up ahead...

               A GIRL in her twenties exits a building down a flight of
               stairs, waits at the bottom for her BOYFRIEND, who's locking
               the door. She sees Alex, gives him an empathetic look.
               Alex walks slowly closer.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren appearing to him, playing their
               game. But the words are wrong, distorted.

                                     LAUREN
                         Your witness list is no match for
                         my kung fu.

               Her Bruce Lee "Oooo" a siren call. RESUME Alex moving slowly
               forward on the street, drawn toward the girl who watches
               with horrified fascination.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm losing you.

               ALEX'S INTERNAL POV

                                     LAUREN
                         Your zigzag love scar is no match
                         for...

               Lauren and Alex drawing very close now when... RESUME WAM.
               A FIST clocks Alex in the face, dropping him hard onto the
               pavement.

                                     GIRL
                         Did you have to do that?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         How about "thank you."

                                     GIRL
                         He's bleeding.

                                     ALEX
                         I don't bleed.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         And delirious. Better steer clear.

               ALEX'S POV

               The Guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl, walks
               her off. Running into a COP at the next intersection. They
               POINT at...

               ALEX takes off, ducking into an alley. Confused.

               CAMERA CREEPS BACKWARD as he gathers his thoughts.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               RATTLE RATTLE. Alex's shadow visible through the frosted
               glass, jostling the locked door.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin!

               SMASH. His arm PUNCHES through the glass, turn the knob.
               Alex enters, arm bleeding badly. He yanks a large piece of
               glass from his flesh. Painful.

               Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a
               necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the
               flow. He scans the room again looking for...

               Something. But everything seems ok. He passes...

               The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a
               piece of TAPE left, sticking to the top of the open lid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      72.


               OVER THE CHESS BOARD - ALEX the missing pic lost on him,
               drawn to the chess board where Walsh collapsed. Something
               wrong with the game. He finds...

               THE BLACK KING Off the board. On top of a stack of news
               clippings lying on the floor.

               Alex picks it up, LEAVING a RING OF BLOOD under.

               CAMERA PUSHES on the clipping underneath, the headline
               "City Leaders Vow Crackdown in Wake of Randall Murder."
               PUSHING, finding among the City Leaders...

                                     ALEX (CONT'D)
                         The King.

               THE CAPTAIN'S FACE circled in blood. Camera continues to
               PUSH on the grainy newsprint, through it, until all we see
               are halftone pixels and the picture loses meaning.

               EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

               The Police Station in sinister CROWVISION as we approach,
               swoop in and...

               INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY

               Alex walks the long approach to the Captain's office, past
               the empty Secretary's desk. KICKING the door open CRASH!
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

               The Captain works alone at his desk under a standing lamp.
               Looks up unconcerned as Alex enters, walks to the desk,
               and SLAPS down the ring-of-blood clipping.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I hate that picture.

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Can I get you something? A glass
                         of water? A transfusion?

                                     ALEX
                         Where are they? Last chance.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Or what? You'll bleed all over my
                         carpet?

               The Captain rises.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You know crime was actually down
                         until you showed up, or stuck

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         around, or whatever the hell you're
                         doing here.
                              (then)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     ALEX
                         I'm looking for my friends.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         See, I heard you were looking for
                         some guy with a scar. How's that
                         going? You find him? Yes? No?

               Alex tenses as the Captain starts toward him.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You are like the guest who would
                         not leave, you know that?  And
                         judging from your condition, maybe
                         you've overstayed your welcome.
                         That's not a criticism. Just an
                         observation.

               Alex draws the knife from his clothes.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         I don't think you're going to use
                         it. That's Lauren's knife.

               Enraged, Alex SWIPES the knife. The Captain grabs his arm
               right at the blood soaked necktie, squeezes hard. Alex
               writhes in pain. In each other's faces now.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You come in here al lfull of
                         righteous indignation, but what
                         have you got to be righteous about?

               THE KNIFE starting to fall from Alex's hand as the Captain
               continues to clamp down on his wound.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         How many innocent people did you
                         leave dead back there?

                                     ALEX
                         You sent them. I had no choice.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Bullshit. You're a killer, that's
                         all you are. A clown with a bird
                         and a rising death toll. You think
                         the world did you wrong?! You did
                         the world wrong.

               The Captain snatches the knife, RAMS it into Alex's midriff.

                         I loved Lauren. I never meant to
                         hurt her.

               ZAP. Electro-spasm as the switch is thrown. No scar, no

               Lauren's NECK is SLASHED, her body riddled with stab wounds.

               The Captain drops Alex lifeless and bloody to the floor.
               Only the sound of the Captain panting now, then...

               The sound of slow clapping. Madden walks into the room

               Madden kicks Alex lightly, nudging him. No life signes.

               She's bent over someone's toes, painting them BLUE.

               WIDE. The Mystery Room revealed. Taxidermy specimens line

               Erin stands in PROFILE in the middle of the room, strangely
               silent, hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the
               ceiling.

               The Secretary brushing polish on Erin's toes.

               The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then
               stands, kisses Erin gently.

                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         All done. Very nice.
                              (then)
                         You're a good listener.

               The Secretary moves off REVEALING...

               ERIN'S FACE MOUTH SEWN shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like
               the scar. Her eyes dart as...

               THE DOOR opens. The Captain and Madden carry Alex in. Madden
               sweeps the TAXIDERMY SPECIMENS back with his hand, clearing
               a space for Alex on the table. Among them...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      77.


               THE CROW on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small
               hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as...

               RESUME WHUMP. Alex heaved onto the table.

                                     MADDEN
                         So was he dead? Or alive?

               The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I've seen birds stuffed and mounted
                         so lifelike you'd swear you saw
                         them breathing.

               This reminds him... he looks at the Crow on the stand.
               Lifeless, stuffed. As it should be.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Maybe we had a case of that here.
                              (to Secretary)
                         Get me my kit.

                                     MADDEN
                         You two are majorly demented. Anyone
                         ever tell you that?

               The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's
               lifeless open eyes pointing toward Erin, reflected in his
               eyeballs first before...

               ANGLE - ERIN looking up at her own hands, bound above her
               as she eases them apart and...

               The HEART SHAPED LOCKET slips from between her palms and
               she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket
               swinging.

               ON THE TABLE X-CLOSE. The locket reflected in Alex's
               lifeless open eyes a second before...

               The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline. Lays out
               the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition.
               Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for
               the procedure.

               Stab wounds everywhere.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Fifty three?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         In all the excitement I kind of
                         lost count.
                              (then)
                         I think I'll mount him with his
                         head up his ass.

               A large KNIFE, the Lauren murder weapon, angles in at the
               base of Alex'sneck where the Secretary's head was.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      78.


               THE CROW - OVERCRANKED moves on the table. Takes flight.

               THE TRIO turn toward the commotion.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Grab it!

               THE LOCKET - OVERCRANKED Snatched in midair by the Crow
               from Erin's praying hands.

               FLASH!  ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV HIGH ANGLE CROWVISION.
               Dim memories from the woods. Anamorphic and dark.

               Two figures--Alex and Erin--kneeling. RESUME - THE LOCKET
               released from the Crow's beak, passing through the TRIO'S
               HANDS uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front
               of his open eyes.

               ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV FLASH. AT GROUND LEVEL. Alex
               fastens the LOCKET around her neck. The distortion
               lessening, becoming Alex's POV.

                                     ALEX
                         ... it connects you to me...

               FLASH.

                                     ERIN
                         No matter what happens... you're
                         innocent... I promise...

               FLASH. Alex painting her face.

               RESUME Alex BLINKS. The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to
               bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest.

               WAM! Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping
               the movement on a dime.

                                     ALEX
                         All lies. Everything you ever showed
                         me.

               MADDEN pulls a gun, points it at Erin. ALEX jumps up, flying
               INTO the gun as it goes off.

               CRASH! They tumble THROUGH THE WINDOW into the Captain's
               office while...

               THE CAPTAIN cuts down the rope holding Erin. She
               collapses...

               ON THE TABLE strewn with blades, secreting one between her
               hands, in the second before...

               THE CAPTAIN drags Erin off. The Secretary flails at the
               Crow with a metal ROD, while...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden has the gun on Alex now.
               BAM! No effect. BAM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      79.


               Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect
               as...

               THE MYSTERY ROOM The Secretary finally connects with the
               Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides
               with...

               Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself. Madden
               c Onfused, not understanding.

                                     SECRETARY (O.S.)
                         It's the bird! Kill it!

               Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture
               window into...

               The SECRETARY dives for cover as bullets explode around
               her. The Crow dancing, sprayed with debris.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               CLOSE. Floor lights sequence above the door, heading for
               underground parking.

               "5 - 4 - 3..." The Captain watches the lights. Erin is
               slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite
               him.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         You brought him back. Good. He
                         owes you. We'll stick together,
                         you and I.

               ON ERIN face pressed against the elevator wall, intent.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         Seen but not heard. They ought to
                         make it a law.

               Erin winces, looks down...

               THE BLADE emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it
               with her two bound hands. DING. The elevator jerks to a
               stop.

               THE CAPTAIN grabs her off the floor and she RAMS the blade
               into his abdomen with the force of the entire body. Twists
               it. The elevator doors open.

               ERIN pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the
               Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she
               swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood. Running now,
               into...

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage,
               cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      80.


               Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded
               animal. He pulls out a GLOCK 9MM and KA-CHUNK. Cycles it.
               Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees.
               Looks around.

               HER POV - SCANNING a small garage with a few police cruisers
               by a SERVICE AREA and no people. A barred GATE over the
               exit. No way out.

               ERIN winces. Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches
               off her mouth with the knife. Drops the threads on the
               floor and moves off...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Alex runs past the glass AWARDS CASE, takes a flying leap
               behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at
               him.

               The slide ratchets back. Madden SLAMS another clip in,
               advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as...

               THE SECRETARY clears stuffed birds off the table trying to
               expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Here pretty bird. Here birdy.

               WHOP! She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as...

               IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden creeps up on the desk, peers
               over it. Nothing. Out of nowhere...

               WAM!  Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room
               with a pained cry of brute force toward...

               THE AWARDS CASE CRASH! Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden,
               who swivels around in time to get off a last shot BAM!

               That collapses Alex to the floor.

               IN THE MYSTERY ROOM The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's
               grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers.

               AT THE AWARD'S CASE Alex hauls himself off the floor as
               the Crow joins him. Seeing...

               MADDEN'S HEAD has taken its place among glass bowls and
               trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests
               on. Down the shelf from the stuffed bird. ALEX rushes
               through the blown out window into...

               Seeing for the first time that Erin is gone, the rope
               hanging from the ceiling, finding...

               THE SECRETARY

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      81.


                                     SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                         sitting on the floor, painting her
                         own toenails BLUE, leaning up
                         against the wall.

                                     ALEX
                         Where'd they go?

               Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around
               her neck, her back to the wall. She looks UP, smiling at...

               WALSH - RIGHT ARM MISSING hangs high overhead from some
               kind of hook. His arm has been crudely removed.

               Underneath him, on the table, a BOX of 2" surgical stainless
               steel rods sits by a pool of blood. ALEX yells, reeling,
               as...

               The door flies open. A half dozen cops in, all targeting
               Alex as...

               THE SECRETARY plunges the Lauren KNIFE in Alex's back. He
               spins violently THROWING her HARD against the wall. WAM!

               Surprise!-she sticks. REVEAL, she's impaled on ANTELOPE
               ANTLERS, hanging off the wall. Her head drops, looking
               down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off
               her toes...

                                     SECRETARY
                              (dying words)
                         My nails.

               BAM BAM BAM. The new arrivals open fire. Alex reaches over
               his shoulder, yanks out the knife with an odd slurping
               sound as...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE

               The sound of GUNFIRE filters down from above as the Captain
               hunts his hidden prey. He stops, studies...

               ERIN'S POV - LOW ANGLE LOOKING UNDER A CAR The Captain's
               feet, joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she
               left on the ground.

               INCLUDE ERIN

                                     SECRETARY
                         reproving herself as she turns
                         toward camera. She looks back under
                         the car, but...

               The Captain's feet have moved off. Where? She listens,
               hears nothing. Slips off...

               NEW ANGLE - ERIN takes refuge in the service area, crouching
               behind stacks of TIRES. Knife at the ready.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      82.


               The Captain's FOOTSTEPS audible.

               HER OBSTRUCTED POV between stacks of tires, the Captain,
               Glock at ready, PASSES BY, moving out of sight. Footsteps
               RECEDING. Then silent.

               ERIN Listening, neurons firing.  Cranes her neck to see.
               Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the
               stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...

               Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls,
               Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense
               on the trigger.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (re: gun)
                         I know you too well. You won't do
                         it.

                                     ERIN
                         You don't know me at all.

               BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the
               gun, aiming just enough off that...

               THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a
               bloody mess. He starts advancing again toward her and Erin
               pulls...

               THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast.
               NOTHING.

               RESUME the Captain takes the gun from her. Shows her the
               CLIP he's carrying in his hand. Slams it into the gun.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         One in the chamber. That's all you
                         get.

               Erin SCREAMS as he drags her off now and...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

               THE CROW flies UP toward the small entry window. Alex
               follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself
               up toward the windowledge.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP

               ERRRKKK. The SOUND of a car in a hurry audible as Alex
               hauls himself out the small window. Runs to the edge,
               spotting...

               FAR BELOW a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around
               the corner of the police station now.

               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

               The Captain nervous at the wheel. He looks over his
               shoulder...

               Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle.

               INT. POLICE STATION - MYSTERY ROOM

               The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the
               carnage.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (crossing himself)
                         Holy mother of God. The devil
                         himself.

               He looks up, where Alex vanished. Starts to climb.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in
               sight...

               HIS MOVING POV partially obstructed, of the sedan below.
               Speeding around another corner now...

               ALEX alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a
               PARAPET where he totters over the vertical face as the
               sedan turning onto the street below.

               THE SERGEANT AND CREW emerge on the roof. Acquire target
               Alex Corvis.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Stop or...! Don't jump!

               WITH ALEX as he takes a flying dive off the building,
               intercepting...

               EXT. POLICE STATION - STREET #

               The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city.
               WAM!

               INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

               WAM! ERRRK! The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely
               keeping control.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What the fuck?

               Erin perks up in the back seat. Battered. Ever hopeful.

               EXT. CITY STREETS #6 - DARK SEDAN

               WIDE. As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we
               see a HUMAN FIGURE standing on top of it, legs spread,
               arms upstretched.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      84.


               PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward,
               right THROUGH the glass moonroof.

               CRASH!  IN THE SEDAN the Captain horrified as Alex's hand
               yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the
               moonroof...

               ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the
               Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing...

               THE ZIGZAG PATTERN, THE MORTIFIED FLESH held in Alex's
               hand like the trophy it is.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. GARRISON'S PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Alex's voice appears. Calm. Unhurried.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE
                         The Jolt, eight amps at two to
                         three thousand volts. It lasts a
                         few seconds. The current surges
                         and is turned off.

               FIND ALEX'S FACE in the darkness. Moving as he performs
               some unseen task. Intent, focussed.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         They wait for the body to cool,
                         then check to see if the heart is
                         still beating.

               FIND ERIN, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice.

               She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where
               the wounds are already healing.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         If it is... ba-boom, ba-boom...
                         another jolt is applied.

               SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.

                                     ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         Experts say unconsciousness occcurs
                         before pain has time to register.
                         They agree electrocution does not
                         "hurt," could not hurt. But it
                         does. Unimaginably. Believe me.

               We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.

               The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the
               door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside.
               Alex looks at the phone on the wall. Silent.

                                                                      85.


                                     ALEX
                         I don't expect a call from the
                         Governor. Any last words? Captain,
                         my Captain?

               REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin
               slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yeah. Fuck you.

               A long beat of silence.

                                     ALEX
                         Was that it? Well, ok.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I'm not dying for your goddamn
                         illusions. You got that? You think
                         you and your girlfriend had some
                         rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit.
                         She was already bored, why do you
                         think she was looking around? You're
                         nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

               A Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. The
               Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.

                                     CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         You can't do this to me you little
                         fucks!  I'll come back, just like
                         you, a big fucking shit spewing
                         bird and three guesses what little
                         bitch I'm taking out first...

               CLOSE. The switch thrown. ZZZZZTTT. PAN UP off the switch
               to...

                                     ERIN
                         You are so dead.

               She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair,
               starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with
               him at...

               THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into
               seething detail.

               Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that
               draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - DAWN

               Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow
               and the first rays of morning light.

               He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over
               his.

                                     ERIN
                         You want to get some breakfast?
                              (then)
                         What I mean is... I don't know how
                         this works, but...

               He stops, face to face now.

                                     ERIN (CONT'D)
                         In the woods you said you had
                         nothing. But you wouldn't, and I
                         wouldn't if there's some way you
                         don't have to go. Please. At least
                         not right away.

                                     ALEX
                         Erin. I'll always be with you.

               For a split second, she's...

               LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off,
               it's...

               ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go.
               Then she spots something...

               ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors.
               "Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone
               has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims."
               ERIN picks up the sign.

                                     ERIN
                         Alex. Look at this.

               She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it
               together as...

               CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls,
               with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which
               is alot.

               As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the
               sign, and starts to CRY.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         In that moment when Alex went...
                         wherever he went... when he made
                         that choice, I knew I was making a
                         choice too. To be alive. In the
                         world. And it made me cry.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN

               CAMERA FINDS Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm
               mercifully away from us. The CROW alights nearby, something
               in its beak.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      87.


                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         Maybe the world is a bad place but
                         the Captain gone has to be some
                         improvement. And that hope, that
                         tomorrow will be better, is enough
                         to keep me going.

               The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by
               Walsh's head. CAMERA keeps MOVING, FINDING..

               The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed
               and mute.

               Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES

               X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing
               the words we are hearing.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE
                         When I think of Lauren fighting
                         and dying, it tears me apart, but
                         it also reassures me. That Lauren
                         and Alex were meant for each other.

               REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically
               transformed wild child.

               A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes
               that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.

                                     ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         That they're together now. Fighters.
                         United by love. And anger. That
                         they've given also to me.

               She's leaning up against a new headstone.

               "Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."

                                     ERIN
                         I love Alex. As my sister always
                         hoped I would. And I love Lauren.
                         And I know, because of this, that
                         love does not die. I'm alive.
                         Thinking of them. Hoping that,
                         sometimes, they're thinking of me.

               Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes
               the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,
               like the one already over Lauren's.

               She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger
               to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.

          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward
          the camera in slow motion.

          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened
          by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven...
          
           
          
          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK.
          A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony
          mask war paint.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day...
          
           
          
          The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again
          into the mists of time.

          a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign.
          
          A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder.
          The man discards the glassine envelope...
          
          FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE
          
          as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of
          a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these
          docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point:
          
          A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON
          
          are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their
          arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN
          (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened
          boy.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          It's okay, Danny. It's okay...

          Lights...
          
           
          
          A bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid
          the glare.

          A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted
          face into view via the lens' reflection.

          CAMERA FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER
          MONKEY, and NEMO.
          
          NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with
          a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face.

          SPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding
          a marigold in his hand.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY

          CAMERA POV (CLOSE ON ASHE'S EYE)
          
          Ashe stares directly into the camera.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          No? Suite yourself, then.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear. Danny is praying
          now, MUMBLING a Catholic School litany.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody up there's listening.
          
           
          
          WHOOSH!
          
          We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV,
          perhaps.
          
          CURVE
          
          leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly,
          shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom
          paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the
          "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also the one who just
          dusted himself
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          (hyped on drugs)
          
          Let's get this over with. Judah's waiting.
          
           
          
          Kali, a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism,
          is methodically loading bullets into her revolver. She's taking
          her own sweet time, in defiance of Curve. There's a tension between
          them. Finally, she flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver shut.
          Kali walks up to them...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I'm scared, Dad.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I know...
          
           
          
          Ashe turns to his executioners, pleading with them...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Listen to me, please. He's just a kid. Let him go. He can't hurt
          you. He doesn't even know who you are...
          
           
          
          ...and puts a bullet through Danny's chest. Ashe SCREAMS.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          NO!!!
          
           
          
          Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him.
          Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes.
          
          Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette
          butt off into the water.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Nothing personal, sport. Guess you were just in the wrong place
          at the wrong time.
          
           
          
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Curve FIRES a gun into Ashe's back. As Ashe
          crumples...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Dump 'em. Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together, the three of them
          heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Bon voyage, shitheads.
          
           
          
          EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe and Danny sink down into the murky underworld, taking their
          place amongst a thousand other deep-sixed dreams.
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          falling further and further away from the light of the surface
          world. Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now
          is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close in around
          us, womblike, peaceful...
          
          ...AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS,
          
          something takes shape - a CROW. Winging its way from Ashe's dream-like
          death up through watery depths into a smog-bound cityscape...
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY OF ANGELS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's
          polluted, man-made river.
          
          THE CROW
          
          rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods,
          and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present
          ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass
          welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK".
          Nevertheless, we continue on.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          They say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight
          years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles later
          I find I'm still living in the past...
          
           
          
          THE CROW
          
          sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and
          grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent
          HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect
          husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters...
          
          WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP
          
          The Crow circles downward...
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Every night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how
          the dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are
          off wandering...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge,
          looking into the loft.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          I just wish I understood what they were telling me.
          
           
          
          CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC)
          
          SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled by
          uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's
          not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the cat
          Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of
          the bed.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Hey, Gabriel...
          
           
          
          Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then
          climbs from bed, making her way across the loft.
          
          SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT
          
          is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy
          warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside -
          an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle
          window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the
          streets below.
          
          ON SARAH'S CANVASSES
          
          Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters.
          Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no
          real surprise.
          
          CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman
          resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced
          lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead.
          
          SARAH
          
          reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper
          arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black
          angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring
          in her navel, another in a nipple...
          
          In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured
          quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here
          eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second we
          see a flash of...
          
           
          
          EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe's death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness.
          Just as suddenly we are back in...
          
           
          
          INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall,
          takes a moment to collect herself.
          
          Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes.
          Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh,
          the symbol of eternity.
          
          As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony
          mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is
          a...
          
          TARNISHED WEDDING RING
          
          Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER".
          
          Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask.
          Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts.
          
          Gabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (WISTFULLY)
          
          Me too.
          
           
          
          She threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next
          to the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah
          stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out.
          
           
          
          EXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK
          
           
          
          An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens
          of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like
          confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she
          peels it off, she catches sight of...
          
           
          
          A PALE FACE
          
          in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out
          on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself,
          shivering from withdrawal.
          
          Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets
          at the girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (DRYLY)
          
          Nice place you've got here.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          (a muttered whisper)
          
          No place else to go.
          
           
          
          Sarah can't help but recognize a part of herself in this lost
          soul.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Gotta name?
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Grace. So what?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee sound? Maybe a little
          food?
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          What do you want?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Nothing. Guess you just remind me of someone I used to know.
          
           
          
          After a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod. Sarah helps her
          from the entryway, into the warmth of the dying light. Grace
          blinks, shields her eyes.
          
          As they walk away down the street, camera rises up to include...
          
          THE CROW
          
          perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them.
          
          CUT TO:
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
          
           
          
          the Gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop - the sole oasis of light
          in an otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse
          buildings. Flickering neon BUZZES in the window.
          
          Nearby is a battered road sign - "END CITY LIMITS". Someone has
          spray-painted "OF THE FUCKING WORLD" over "city limits". In the
          distance, the bridge of the River Styx rises through the mist
          like a skeletal dinosaur.

          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Almost finished. Doing okay?
          
           
          
          CUSTOMER (V.O.)
          
          Yeah, stings a little.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          That's why they call me the Mistress of Pain.
          
           
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sarah expertly guiding the needle, wearing
          glasses, surgical gloves, concentrating.
          
          Sarah's buzz-headed CUSTOMER sits in a ratty dentist's chair.
          Sarah is finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds its
          way over the man's forearm. She makes another line of color then
          sits back, smoothing more Vaseline over the man's arm. She picks
          up a jeweler's loupe, makes an adjustment on her needle...
          
          Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered
          with sheets of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves crammed with
          reference works. Sarah's partner, NOAH, a chain-smoking proto-punk
          Brit, consults with a YOUNG GRUNGE COUPLE.
          
          LATER -
          
          Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah sterilizes some needles
          in an autoclave.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading
          this, you're too close" on his bleedin' bum!
          
           
          
          Sarah smiles. Noah fires up a fag, flops down into a dentist
          chair. The two slip into a familiar, good-natured banter.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Christ, I'm knackered.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Beats pushing ink in Detroit.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          That it does, Princess, that it does.
          
          (REMEMBERING)
          
          Oh, I bought you a little present...
          
           
          
          Noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's
          a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued
          to the bottom - a fortune.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          They do 'em for the Day of the Dead.
          
          (tossing the skull to Sarah)
          
          Nice, huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (reading fortune)
          
          "Life is just a dream on the way to death." I like that.
          
           
          
          Sarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding.
          Noah rises, stretching.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Want to grab a beer, then?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          No, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          So, what's the dirty dog's name?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I've just been having some weird dreams.
          
          (REFLECTING)
          
          You ever dream that you're dying someone else's death?
          
           
          
          Outside we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS
          on the front door.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          (calling out)
          
          Sorry, we're closed.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Open the fucking door!
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          stands, moves to the door.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Look, I said we're...
          
           
          
          BANG! Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah
          in the nose, then heads straight for Sarah.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          You think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          What are you talking about?!
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          I'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off
          the bandages. Look...!!!
          
           
          
          Curve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest.
          
          CURVE'S TATTOO
          
          It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black. Or is it? Upon
          closer examination the crow looks like something else - two demons
          fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the
          picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen
          as a skull.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          A crow...
          
          Damn right, it's a crow. And did I ask for a fucking bird on
          my chest? Did I?!
          
           
          
          Sarah shakes her head.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Then what-the-fuck is it doing there?!
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I don't know, I was just going from the design you gave me...
          
           
          
          SMACK! Curve backhands Sarah across the face. Noah rushes forward,
          blood still running from his nose.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Stop it!
          
           
          
          Curve pulls an automatic from his waist-band and points the gun
          at Noah. Noah freezes...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          What's it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye?
          I think so. I think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn
          ready.
          
           
          
          Curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the
          contents. He presses the gun against Noah's forehead.
          
           
          
          SARAH (O.S.)
          
          Over here, ass-hole...
          
           
          
          As Curve turns, Sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the
          killer's eyes, blinding him.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Agh!!! SHIT!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah plants one of her Doc Marten boots in Curve's groin. He
          SCREAMS, doubles over. Sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp
          and trains it on him.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get up.
          
           
          
          Curve cups his balls, slowly rises. His eyes are glowing with
          manic intensity. A slow smile creeps across Curve's face. He
          backs away towards the front door.
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          Shoulda killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum. Be seeing
          you.
          
           
          
          Curve smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor.
          Moments later we hear his motorcycle ROAR to life. He takes off,
          ENGINE SCREAMING away into the night.
          
          Sarah lowers the gun, takes a deep breath, looks to Noah.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You okay?
          
           
          
          Noah wipes his bloody nose, looks to the floor where Curve discarded
          the drug sachet, shakes his head in disgust.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Fuck me, wonder what they'll be snorting next?
          
           
          
          Sarah shakes her head, at wits end.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I just can't do this anymore... I'm so tired of this.
          
           
          
          Noah pulls Sarah toward him, gives her a big hug.
          
           
          
          NOAH
          
          Easy there, luv. It'll all work out.
          
           
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah, still clutching Curve's gun, hurries to her Galaxy 500
          which is parked along the nearby train tracks.

          Sarah moves behind the wheel, dumps the gun on the seat, and
          rests her head in her hands. As Sarah raises her head...
          
          SARAH'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)
          
          The Crow is perched on the hood of her car. Sarah HONKS her horn
          in frustration. The Crow doesn't move.
          
           
          
          EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get out of here! Go!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into
          the night. Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and
          starts to cry.

          EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights
          of Downtown. In the distance, a flashing "JESUS SAVES" sign draws
          our attention to a monolithic tower.
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned
          by a weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque
          of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured
          up from an art nouveau fever-dream.
          
          Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away.
          We, however, continue to rush onward, right through one of the
          dark openings in the scrollwork...
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          SCRITCH! SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny
          reflections...
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within
          a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight
          on its shiny carapace. The beetle strains at its leash, moving
          in a perpetual circle around the nail.
          
          CAMERA MOVES UP
          
          over the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, this
          enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our little
          member of the Coleoptera is concerned.
          
          AS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK
          
          we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory...
          
          Dark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous
          palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. The
          upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network
          of steel girders.
          
          Look close enough and you might see PEOPLE bound to the supporting
          pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot
          of your bed in the middle of the night.
          
          VOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail
          curtains. CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. We
          linger there for a tantalizing moment...
          
           
          
          JUDAH (V.O.)
          
          Talk to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see.
          
           
          
          SIBYL (V.O.)
          
          I see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name
          on his tongue.
          
           
          
          Now we plunge in through the curtains...
          
          The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which
          project images from the outside world onto a circular table,
          offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape.
          TWO FIGURES stand with their backs to us, studying the camera's
          view. The first is...
          
          JUDAH EARL,
          
          A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice.
          Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own
          death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one.
          
          SIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, though
          of indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden beneath
          a black cowl.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          (FATALISTIC)
          
          It's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear,
          can you tell me that?
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          I see the face of one of your victims.
          
           
          
          Judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for
          the first time. A kind of madness dances within them.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          All my sins remembered.

          Sarah sits in bed, cigarette burning in one hand, a half-filled
          wine glass in the other. She turns out her light, looks to the
          window and the cityscape beyond - as if the answers were lying
          out there in the steam-cloaked streets.
          
          CUT TO:
          
          SOMEONE'S SPEED-INDUCED POV. Performers flaunt their flesh on
          a raised stage. CROWDS OF SEXUAL LIBERTINES and CUTTING EDGE
          FETISHISTS writhe as one on the dance floor. Lots of rubber,
          latex strap bodices, Victorian hoop skirts - it's a modern-day
          De Sade's wet-dream.

          Ashe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh.
          The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing
          his hands and face, shredding his clothes. He's caught in his

          Strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest, the barbs
          buried deep in his flesh.
          
          Reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear. Ashe's

          it into Ashe's chest.
          
          Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle
          stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out.

          An image rendered by a child's optimistic imagination - a crude
          father and sone, respectively labeled "DAD" and "ME". A FOOTPRINT
          mars the otherwise perfect memento. Ashe touches the figure labeled
          "ME", which triggers...
          
           
          
          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          
           
          
          Ashe is working beneath a car. Danny is sprawled on the floor.
          He holds up the painting in question.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          Hey, Dad...what color should I make the sun?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Blue.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          There's no such thing.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          No. Well there should be.
          
           
          
          Just then we hear a GUNSHOT coming from outside.

          Danny climbs to his feet, moves outside...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Danny, wait!
          
           
          
          Ashe slides out from under the car.

          From the back doorway, Ashe and Danny catch sight of Curve and
          his crew executing someone beneath the freeway overpass. Curve's
          face is splattered with blood. He turns and sees them...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          See no evil.

          Now we're back at the pier. The memory flashes are coming faster
          and faster. Danny is sobbing once again.
          
           
          
          DANNY'S VOICE

          We see Kali raise her gun. BANG! There's the muzzle flash! Ashe
          SCREAMS...
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Ashe is tearing the place apart, sobbing, knocking over racks
          of tools. Finally, he sinks to his knees, his face a mask of
          tears.
          
          Ashe spins, murderous rage in his eyes. Never startle an animal,
          right?
          
          SARAH
          
          stands in the doorway.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Why are you here?
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I don't know.
          
           
          
          She stops herself -- she does know, she just didn't want to admit
          it to herself.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I want to help you. I need to.
          
           
          
          Sarah approaches, dropping by Ashe's side. She sees Danny's painting
          which Ashe cradles protectively.
          
          Ashe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Everything's so confused...
          
          (anguished, touching the drawing)
          
          Danny...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          He's not here anymore.
          
           
          
          Sarah draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle. She reaches
          out to him, drawing him into her arms. He stares up at her, eyes
          distant.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          There's no moon...
          
           
          
          Sarah touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through
          his pain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You've been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things
          right...
          
           
          
          Sarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered
          nearby. She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the
          lid, dipping her fingers inside...
          
          Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic
          feel to it. Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual
          attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable.
          
          As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face
          using Danny's art supplies.
          
          We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here,
          fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips being
          smeared with black...
          
          ...the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different
          from Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through
          Ashe's own, unique pain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I believe there've always been people like you...
          
           
          
          Sarah has finished. She sits back, surveying her work...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          It's the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again.
          
           
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE as he turns towards us. A slash of light
          illuminates the signature black and white war-paint of the Crow
          in all its glory. Ashe looks like a dark saint.

          Ashe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass
          on his motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping
          behind him like a fallen angel's wings.
          
          THE CROW
          
          flies alongside Ashe.
          
          THE CROW
          
          lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse.
          
          Presently we hear Ashe's MOTORCYCLE approaching, then we see
          the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground.
          
          CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC)
          
          Ashe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the bird the thumbs-up sign...

          bags as a hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing
          the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up...
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL the lab set up in a maze of barrells. The
          walls are stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows sweat
          with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and
          condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery
          acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon
          drums containing the finished product.
          
          Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing
          to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring
          lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant
          gets gored.
          
          Suddenly the power in the lab goes out, the TV screen sputters
          and goes dark.

          with envy of all the dead'.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey whirls around, startled. Ashe is sitting cross-legged
          on one of the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Tell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a familiar face?
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          Who the fuck are you?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You have to learn to look beyond the mask.
          
           
          
          Ashe jumps down from the table, walking into the light. Spider
          Monkey's eyes widen in recognition.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          No way, man...we put you under...you and that little snot-nosed
          kid...
          
           
          
          Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows
          a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey,
          terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching
          for something...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Looking for this?
          
           
          
          Ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Don't try this at home, kids.
          
           
          
          BOOM! ASHE
          
          puts a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward
          and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward
          toward Ashe's body...
          
          ASHE
          
          springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table
          of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic
          contents.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          What are you?! What the fuck are you?!
          
           
          
          Ashe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey.
          I'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All
          your nightmares rolled into one.
          
           
          
          Ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes
          his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it.
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY

          I'll start with Nemo, then work my way up the food chain. Where
          is he?
          
           
          
          SPIDER MONKEY
          
          Nemo? Nemo's an old gash-hound. He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama
          on Deacon Street!
          
           
          
          WHOOSH! Ashe blows the match out.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Congratulations, monkey. You just bought yourself a fighting
          chance.
          
           
          
          Ashe reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards.
          He fans them out, points...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Pick a card, monkey.
          
           
          
          Spider Monkey slowly extends his hand, half-expecting Ashe to
          pounce on him. He pulls a card out.
          
          Spider Monkey tosses the card down, face up. He's got the Jack
          of Hearts. he smiles tentatively. Ashe pulls out a card of his
          own and flips it around - the King of Clubs.
          
           
          
          ASHE

          emerges from the raging conflagration, walking right through
          the flames, indifferent to the heat. A flurry of the tiny glassine

          Seeems to me it's more a question of fate believing in you.
          
           
          
          Sarah rises, reaching for her bag. As she heads for the exit,
          Noah reaches for the sketch. He smoothes it out, studies the

          He touches the Crow tattoo.

          Now we see that the glass shards have fallen in an array that

          The Peep-O-Rama occupies an old Japanese movie house. A geisha-girl
          sign flashes over the marquee. Beneath that is a blinking neon
          eye which opens and closes. Other signs offer enticements like
          "ONLY 25 CENTS A PEEP!" and "REAL GIRLS WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH
          COLLEGE!"
          
          As Nemo approaches, a laconic HINDU with a throat microphone
          sits outside, reciting his tired schpiel.

          Nemo enters a cramped booth, clutching a handful of tokens embossed
          with the Peep-O-Rama eye logo on them. There's a seat, a box
          of Kleenex, a phone, and a grimy Plexiglas window with a metal
          shutter over it.
          
          Nemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window,
          pockets the rest of them.
          
          With a WHIR the metal shutter rises, revealing a WOMAN in a garter-belt
          get-up perched on a stool. In a forgiving light, she might even
          be beautiful.
          
          An LED display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds
          remaining on the metered shutter. Nemo picks up the receiver.

          Holly shrugs out of her bra, plants her scuffed-up high heels
          on either side of the window, runs her hands up and down her
          body, utters some tired-ass MOANS.

          Nemo comes flying out the booth door. He struggles to rise. A
          CHORUS OF ORGASMIC SIGHS and cheesy SURF MUSIC drifts out from
          the other booths.

          ZEKE, the Peep-O-Rama's corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off
          shotgun. BOOM! He blows a blast into Ashe's chest!
          
          Ashe starts toward Zeke, unfazed. Zeke moves to fire again...
          
          Ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing
          him in the face with the butt-end. Zeke falls back into a video
          display, sending an avalanche of porno tapes raining down on
          top of him.
          
          Seizing the moment, Nemo rushes for the exit...
          
          Ashe spins, pumps the shotgun, blows out one of Nemo's kneecaps.
          Nemo collapses on the floor, wailing like a child. Ashe strides
          over to him.

          doll - the kind with a built-in pre-recorded memory chip.

          Ashe HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into

          Ashe plunges his fingers into Nemo's eyes - killing him off-camera.
          He lifts up his now blood-covered hands and turns...
          
          Just then, Holly Daze bursts out into the hall. She sees Ashe
          and YELPS, certain her number's up. Ashe grabs her by the wrist,
          spinning her around.

          Jump-cut bump and grind, CAT-CALLS, LAUGHTER, the distorted faces

          shuts his eyes, reeling...
          
          Ashe looks up at Holly - one victim to another. His eyes burn
          a laser beam into her soul.

          Holly Daze nods with conviction. Ashe releases her. She bolts

          Curve ROARS UP on his motorcycle, followed by Kali and a car-load
          of ENFORCERS. The team grab their weapons, head for the porno

          Kali leads the crew of killers into the porno shop. But Curve
          stops, sensing something. He spins around...
          
          THE CROW
          
          is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him.

          Kali and Curve move down the dark corridor. The PORN ACTRESS
          VOICES from the vid-booths continue their ORGIASTIC MOANS, but
          one voice in particular stand out.

          Ooh, oh baby, you're so good...
          
           
          
          CAMERA FINDS NEMO'S BODY
          
          at the end of the corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex doll
          which is still repeating its tinny refrain. Nemo's neck has been
          snapped and his head hangs at an awkward angle.
          
           
          
          DOLL
          
          ...oh! Oh yea, that's the spot. Do me, baby. Do me.
          
           
          
          There's a folded piece of paper shoved into Nemo's mouth. Curve
          pries it out. The paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut-outs
          we used to make in grade school - only this cut-out is of a crow.
          
          Written across the paper crow are the following words:
          
          " I KNOW WHY JESUS WEPT"
          
           
          
          A phone on the wall is RINGING. RINGING and RINGING. Finally,
          Curve leans in, snatches up he receiver...
          
           
          
          ASHE'S VOICE
          
          Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve?
          
           
          
          At the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear.
          
           
          
          ASHE'S VOICE
          
          A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it.
          
           
          
          CLICK! The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from
          the wall, HEAVING it across the porno shop.

          Ashe exits a phone booth, leaving the receiver dangling. A DOG
          BARKS nearby, followed by the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Ashe
          turns and sees...
          
          A GROUP OF CHILDREN running away, giggling, their FOOTSTEPS receding
          into the night.
          
          A BLACK DOG trots toward Ashe. The children have tied a plastic
          skull mask to the dog's head. The skull dog trots up the street
          towards...
          
          A SMALL, INNER-CITY LATINO CHURCH
          
          sandwiched between two derelict buildings. The doors are open
          - there's a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps.
          The skull dog trots up the steps and enters.

          Ashe moves into the sanctuary. He watches from the rear, entranced.
          PEOPLE are scattered amongst the pews.
          
          At the altar is a lavish offrenda - an offering of food and drink
          for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral
          garlands. Amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved
          ones. There are tiers of candles surrounding these, scores of
          them.
          
          An ELDERLY PRIEST emerges from a confessional, looking to Ashe
          with a raised eyebrow..."Next?".
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Can I help you?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I'm sorry, Father, I was just watching...
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Our doors are open.
          
           
          
          The Priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers.

          Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead. We light the candles
          for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to
          earth and share in the pleasures of the living.
          
           
          
          Ashe watches an OLD WOMAN place a toy motorcycle in front of
          a picture of a child.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Tomorrow night we will celebrate. The people will dance, sing...
          
          (indicating Ashe's makeup)
          
          ...many will wear masks.

          Some spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking
          themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away.
          
           
          
          The priest nods to Ashe and moves down the aisle to the next
          candelabra.
          
          A LITTLE BOY
          
          is watching Ashe from one of the back pews. He clutches a striped
          ball. He drops it.
          
          The boy rolls the ball across the floor to Ashe. Ashe kneels
          and catches it, rolling it back. The boy smiles.

          Ashe moves towards Sarah's paintings, pausing to study the one
          of the woman being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover.
          He touches the woman's face.

          Ashe notices a number of scars on her forearm, possibly some
          track marks...
          
          Sarah catches him looking, self-consciously pulls her hand back.

          ASHE
          
          I've been here.
          
           
          
          Ashe stares at the picture, entranced, caught up in a moment
          of wistful nostalgia for the life he's lost.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I took Danny last summer. We went up on the bike, rode all the
          way up the coast...
          
          (BEAT)
          
          It was cold up there. I remember we could see each other's breath.
          
           
          
          Ashe catches himself, setting the postcard down. He turns his
          back to Sarah, hiding his face form her, overcome by emotion.
          
          Sarah stands, drawing near. She reaches out to console him, touching
          his shoulder. She alone, among all the souls of the world, understands
          the isolation that is consuming Ashe.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Look at me.
          
           
          
          But Ashe won't.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Ashe. Look at me.
          
           
          
          Ashe finally turns around, a sense of deep and profound loss
          in his eyes...
          
          Something unspoken passes between them. Sarah leans into Ashe,
          tentative, eyes searching. It's one of those fragile moments
          where things could go either way. And then...
          
           
          
          ASHE

          No...

          We can't do this...
          
           
          
          The spell has been broken. Ashe starts away from her.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I have to finish what I started. I have to find the others.

          Ashe moves to the door, hesitant, a terrible sense of longing
          gnawing at his heart.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I wish I'd met you before.
          
           
          
          Ashe nods, then turns to leave. There's nothing else to say.

          Within the bakery are mountains of sugar skulls, candy skeletons,
          and pan de muerte (bread of the dead). Ashe's reflection is superimposed
          over this morbid tableau.

          Curve and Kali have duct-taped Noah to one of the dentist chairs
          - even his mouth and nose have been sealed shut. Curve lets Noah
          thrash a moment, then violently rips the tape from Noah's face.

          We're looking for Sarah. Where is she, Noah?
          
           
          
          NOAH

          Kali sites astride Noah. She reaches for one of the tattoo machines.
          She motions to Curve, who hits the treadlight foot switch. Noah
          eyes the sparking tattoo machine with rising apprehension as
          Kali moves it towards his face.
          
          CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE
          
          a vibrating blur just a few centimeters from Noah's blinking
          eye. Noah tries to shut his eyes. Kali forces an eye open with
          the thumb and forefinger of her other hand.

          reflected in the bar mirror, materializing out of the narcotic

          and black leather Ashe looks like he's just another part of the
          twisted scene. people are stroking him, brushing up against him
          - like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma.

          to his feet, starts running...
          
          The Samoan bartender grabs a semi-auto pistol, opens up on Ashe.
          Now some of the other ARMED DOORMEN are FIRING too...
          
          ...but Ashe keeps on coming, trudging through the HAIL OF GUNFIRE.
          Bullets are EXPLODING over his body at an insane rate. Ashe is
          a human roman candle. Nothing is going to stop him from reaching
          Curve, nothing.
          
          The Samoan stops firing. He takes one look at Ashe, who's still
          coming at them...

          Up ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway.
          Curve guides his bike through the hole...
          
           
          
          INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Curve speeds into the dark tunnel, splashing through puddles
          of water, whipping past graffiti. As he nears the mouth at the
          other end, Curve brakes hard, TIRES SQUEALING, almost going down...
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          We are now beneath the bridge. It's a stone-cold dead-end. The
          roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete
          river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          We hear the ROAR of an approaching motorcycle, then an engine
          cutting out. Curve looks back the way he came...
          
          AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TUNNEL
          
          Ashe's siilhouette steps into view. He's on foot now, clutching
          the sawed-off shotgun. He lets loose a LAUGH which chills Curve
          to the bone.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "I have a rendezvous with Death, on some scarred slope of battered
          hill..."
          
           
          
          Ashe starts into the tunnel. His WET FOOTSTEPS echo off the weeping
          walls...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in
          blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath..."
          
           
          
          As Ashe draws closer, his death-like face emerges from the gloom
          - a ghastly visage floating in the ether...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "But I have a rendezvous with Death. And I to my pledged word
          am true..."
          
           
          
          Ashe stops some twenty feet away, grinning like the Cheshire
          Cat.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          "I shall not fail that rendezvous."
          
           
          
          Silence like knives. Ashe and Curve facing one another. Curve
          is tense, dry-mouthed...
          
           
          
          CURVE
          
          You think i'm afraid of you, you fucking freak?! YOU THINK I'M
          AFRAID?!!
          
           
          
          Curve SCREAMS and guns his cycle forward, rolling the throttle
          all the way open - a kamikaze run aimed straight at Ashe.
          
          Ashe stands his groupd, lifts the shotgun, FIRST at Curve's customized
          teardrop gas tank. There's the woman doing the wild thing with
          Death and...
          
          BOOM! CURVE'S MOTORCYCLE
          
          disintegrates beneath him, breaking apart into a RUSHING COMET
          OF FLAMING WRECKAGE. Shrapnel skids along the tunnel walls, SPEWING
          SPARKS.
          
          CURVE
          
          lies on the garbage-strewn tunnel floor in a spreading pool of
          blood - burnt, battered, a barb of steel sticking up from his
          chest. Still, Curve has one glorious, giddy moment where he thinks
          he's actually succeeded in defeeating Ashe, then...
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          as Ashe steps through the gasoline flames.
          
          Curve's elation vaporizes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Can you hear me, Curve?
          
           
          
          Curve offers a weak nod.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You're going to die now.
          
           
          
          Curve tries to speak, blood spills from his mouth. Ashe places
          a finger to his lips.
          
          Ashe drops down, kneeling over Curve's chest.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead. Do you know
          why? So they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river
          Styx.
          
          (reaching to Curve's ear)
          
          What's this?
          
           
          
          In a parody of a stage magician, Ashe retrieves one of the Peep-O-Rama
          tokens from Curve's ear. The embossed eye logo flashes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Open your mouth, Curve.
          
           
          
          Curve,s eyes are wide, filled with terror. He MOANS.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Shhh. It's not so bad. Trust me. I've been there.
          
           
          
          Curve slowly opens his mouth. Tears run from his eyes. Ashe places
          the coin on Curve's tongue, like a priest administering a Holy
          wafer.
          
          Ashe stands, grabs Curve by the coat collar. He pulls him back
          towards the end of the tunnel...
          
           
          
          EXT. TUNNEL MOUTH/RIVER - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe drags Curve down the sloping end of the spillway to the
          waters edge.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I want to thank you for showing me my pain, Curve. You made me
          what I am.
          
           
          
          ON ASHE
          
          As he releases Curve, letting the current carry him away. Ashe
          stands, tracking Curve's progress.
          
          ON CURVE
          
          as he floats downstream, limbs outstretched, consciousness fading
          fast.
          
          CURVE'S POV
          
          GHOSTLY FACES stare down at him from the girders - people who
          have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches
          overhead.
          
          A WOMAN lets loose a cloud of marigold petals. They flutter down
          around Curve, swirling in the currents.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          the petals have clustered around Curve's body in the shape of
          a Crow. Curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary,
          borne away on the wings of the bird.

          Ashe starts back into the tunnel. He pauses a moment, kneeling
          down, lowering his head. Whether out of respect for the dead
          or his own condition, we'll never know.
          
          After a minute, Ashe lifts his head again and stands. It's time
          to see his mission through to the end.

          ASHE
          
          is seeing what the crow is witnessing - Sarah in danger.

          Ashe is on the motorcycle, racing through the streets. He takes
          a corner on a skid, zipping past the Gray Gargoyle and the neighboring
          train tracks.

          Ashe stumbles through the doorway into the loft...
          
          The loft has been trashed. Furniture turned over, paintings slashed,
          the ceramic irony mask smashed into pieces...
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Sarah's gone, ghost man.
          
           
          
          Ashe whirls around
          
          KALI
          
          who had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from
          behind Sarah's paintings.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Where is she?
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          Judah's tower. He's waiting for you there.
          
           
          
          As Kali steps closer we see that she's dressed for war -- a katana
          secured in a black scabbard, twin daggers on each hip, a bandoleer
          of throwing stars.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You took my son's life.
          
           
          
          KALI

          Some people are born victims.

          It takes two to make a murder.
          
           
          
          Kali unsheathes her katana. The blade edge catches the streetlight's
          glare coming in from the window.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          Shall we dance?
          
           
          
          Kali comes at Ashe blindingly fast. She spins and cartwheels
          end over end, somersaulting. As she lands, Kali shifts into Ginsu-mode,
          her blade a whirling blur...
          
          Ashe ducks under the blade, trapping Kali's sword arm. He twists
          his hands, SNAPPING her arm...
          
          As Kali CRIES OUT, Ashe pivots, THROWING HER towards the half-moon
          window looking out over the street...

          Sarah's eyelids flutter open with a start. She's waking on the
          heels of a dream.
          
          PULL BACK to reveal Sarah curled up on the cold tile floor, a
          number of candles burning nearby. Sarah sits up, disoriented.
          Upon moving her arm she finds that it's been shackled to one
          of the pillars via a long chain.
          
          Sarah wastes a few moments tugging at her tether, trying to snap
          one of the links, but it's no good.
          
          Frustrated, Sarah looks around, trying to get her bearings...
          
          SIBYL
          
          is standing a few yards away, cloaked in darkness, head bowed.
          Sarah didn't notice her at first.
          
           
          
          SARAH

          The Tower. Everyone finds their way here eventually.
          
           
          
          Sarah rises from the floor, a little unsteady. She moves towards
          Sibyl, reaches out to touch her shoulder. The prophetess abruptly
          lifts her head, causing her hood to fall back. Sarah takes a
          step back, GASPING...
          
          SIBYL'S EMPTY EYE SOCKETS
          
          have been sewn shut with black thread.

          Sarah spins...
          
          JUDAH
          
          emerges from the gloom, almost as if he were materializing from
          the shadows themselves.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Sibyl's been cursed with the gift of prophecy. She sees things
          that are fated to happen...
          
          (BEAT)
          
          She cut her eyes out with a carving knife because she wanted
          to make the visions stop...
          
           
          
          Judah brushes the back of his hand affectionately against Sibyl's
          cheek.
          
           
          
          JUDAH

          Sibyl turns her head away from Judah, shunning his caress.

          I'm glad you asked that, Sarah. You've got a very important part
          to play in this little drama of ours. You see, I intend to capture
          the Crow...
          
           
          
          Judah draws near, devouring Sarah with his hungry eyes. USING
          A JAGGED FINGERNAIL, HE INCISES A CROSS INTO HER FOREHEAD.

          Kali comes CRASHING through the window, falling down to the sidewalk
          below. She lands atop a wrecked car, snapping her back in two...
          
          CLOSE ON KALI
          
          lies on the ground, her limbs twisted at awkward angles. She
          MOANS, somehow still alive.
          
          KALI'S POV
          
          as Ashe approaches. The Crow flits in from off-screen, landing
          on his shoulder. Watching Kali with it's curious golden eyes.
          
          As Ashe draws near, Kali tries to rise. The most she can do is
          lift her head.
          
           
          
          KALI

          I...can't...move...
          
           
          
          Ashe stares at her, dispassionate.

          Ashe simply shakes his head.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          You...have to.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          My job is to send you to hell. You're in it.
          
           
          
          Kali stares at Ashe in disbelief, her stoic warrior's mien quickly
          evaporating.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          There's no...honor in this. It's my...death. I've won it..
          
           
          
          Ashe turns and starts away.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Me, too.
          
           
          
          KALI
          
          Wait! Where are you going?! Wait! You can't...do this! You can't
          do this!!!
          
           
          
          But Ashe doesn't turn back. He leaves Kali in the cold, wet street,
          ignoring her pathetic laments.
          
          Ashe continues on to the end of the alley...
          
          THE CROW
          
          lands on Ashe's outstretched hand.
          
          The Crow takes wing, lifting its way up into the night.
          
          Ashe fires up the motorcycle's engine, tearing away from Sarah's
          apartment in a cloud of smoke.

          SARAH
          
          Why are you doing this?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Have you ever read Dante's Inferno? It says that the only true
          path through Hell lies at its center. If you want to escape it
          -- you have to go further in.
          
           
          
          Judah lowers himself into a chair.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          When I was a boy I fell through the ice of a lake. I remember
          seeing the sky through the ice above me, close enough to touch.
          The world grew cold around me. Dark. Eventually my heart stopped
          beating. And in that moment, I died.
          
           
          
          Judah sweeps his hand through one of the candle flames, then
          pinches the flame out of existence. A tiny wisp of smoke trails
          up into shadow.
          
          Judah settles back in his chair, overcome by a memory that for
          him has never lost its vibrancy.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          A half-hour later I awoke on an operating table. I had returned
          to the world of flesh and bone -- But I brought a knowledge back
          with me...
          
          (tapping his forehead)
          
          Forbidden knowledge.
          
           
          
          Judah leans in close to Sarah, his lambent eyes glowing like
          hot coals. As Judah continues, Sarah fingers the ankh which hangs
          from her neck.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I've been living on borrowed time ever since. I've always known
          Death would be coming for me.
          
          (BEAT)
          
          I see now that your friend is the one I've been waiting for.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          You can't stop him.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You're wrong, Sarah.
          
          (RISING)
          
          There is a way to defeat Death... and that's to trade places
          with him.

          A HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE
          
          piloted by a man in a devil mask suddenly looms up in front of
          Ashe. The street ahead has been cordoned off with flashing wooden
          barricades. There's some kind of street fiesta going on...
          
          Ashe swerves, BRAKING HARD to avoid hitting the carriage. Ashe's
          bike slips out from under him and Ashe goes CRASHING into the
          barricades. But even as the carriage's skull-faced costumed occupants
          rush up to help him...

          CROW'S POV
          
          Sarah sits within one of the pools of illumination far below,
          still bound to the bed by the chain. Judah and Sibyl are nowhere
          in sight.
          
          THE CROW
          
          flies down from the rafters, landing on the floor at Sarah's
          feet. It CAWS at her, trying to communicate.

          WHOOSH! A steel cage on a wire and pulley system CLATTERS down
          from above, SLAMMING to the floor and trapping the bird within
          it. The bird CAWS angrily, flitting from one side of the cage
          to another, but its efforts are futile.

          Judah, now carrying the cage which contains the Crow, sweeps
          aside the curtain of the camera obscura. He reaches up to a lever

          sets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table. He peels

          the cage. The Crow flaps his wings madly, desperately trying
          to strike at Judah with its beak and claws...
          
          ... but Judah secures his grip around the bird's throat, pulling

          STONE MAIDEN
          
          which protrudes from the building's facade. The maiden's face
          has been all but worn bare by the harsh elements.
          
          Ashe clutches the back of the maiden in a parody of a lover's
          embrace. Using the statue for support, he drags himself back
          up to relative safety. Now Ashe is face to face with the maiden,
          staring into its blind stone eyes.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Sarah.
          
           
          
          Ashe whispers the word like a mantra, using it to urge him on.
          Steeling himself again, fighting the burning pain, Ashe resumes
          his climb. He's on autopilot now, just trying to reach the campanile,
          which at this point, seems hopelessly unattainable.
          
          THE SKY ABOVE
          
          seems to churn and roil. A storm of epic proportions is about
          to break.

          CITY STREET
          
          The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower
          rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge
          the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy. Everyone
          is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers...
          
          ASHE
          
          comes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall filled to the
          brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry of
          golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form.
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords. Blood
          is pooling beneath black flight feathers.
          
          Judah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of
          his crime.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          It's done.
          
           
          
          Judah looks to the camera obscura's table. The blood from the
          Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling
          it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl. The end result
          is an eerie reflecting pool.
          
          AS WE WATCH, THE IMAGE OF THE CLOUDS
          
          cast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve,
          only to be replaced by Judah's own, shimmering reflection.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          With a shaking hand, Judah dips his fingers into the pooling
          blood and begins to paint his face. A swatch of blood over one
          eye, then a swatch over the other. A long, bloody smear over
          his lips...
          
          The action harkens back to the moment when Sarah painted Ashe's
          face - a parallel ritual turned on its head.

          Judah turns towards us, his transformation now complete. We see
          that he has painted himself a parody of Ashe's irony mask in
          the Crow's own blood.
          
          SARAH
          
          watches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity.
          
          JUDAH
          
          scoops up a handful of the Crow's blood and brings it to his
          lips.
          
          CLOSE ON JUDAH'S LIPS

          and neck.

          his once-pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance.
          
          WE RISE UP
          
          from Judah, up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower.
          Judah is LAUGHING, laughing in the face of Death itself.

          Ashe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers.
          
          THE MASKED CELEBRANTS
          
          slowly gather around Ashe, craning their necks for a view of
          the fallen angel.
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE
          
          Relaxed, peaceful, even. For a moment, we aren't sure whether
          or not Ashe's soul has fled.
          
          The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're
          in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder
          to a stop. And the only thing we hear are...
          
          THE CROWS
          
          Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS.
          
          Ashe slowly opens his eyes, tentative. When you're this deep
          in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken,
          but waken he does...
          
          ASHE'S POV - THE SKY ABOVE JUDAH'S TOWER
          
          is black with crows. And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling
          madly about.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ashe sits up, stares at the crows, fascinated, frightened. Then
          his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him. We are in
          dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality.
          
          A CHILD
          
          wearing a skull mask pushes to the front of the crowd. He stares
          at Ashe a moment, then lifts the mask from his face...
          
          It's Danny.

          Ashe rushes to Danny's side, holding him tight, his disbelief
          overpowered by the unfettered joy of seeing his son once again.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What are you doing here?!
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          It's time to go back, Dad.
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up at the screaming crows above them.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Is that why they're here?
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          (NODDING)
          
          They're the souls who came before you. They're crying for the
          people they've lost.

          DANNY
          
          You don't understand, Dad. You work for the dead, not the living.
          Your work here is done.
          
           
          
          Ashe reaches for his son's shoulders, all but pleading with him.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I can't go, not yet, not now...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          You have to.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Danny, I can't leave her like this...
          
           
          
          The CRIES of the crows grow louder as the sky above becomes darker.
          
          A shadow passes over Danny's face. He Seems Saddened. For a moment,
          it seems as if another entity creeps into Danny's voice.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          If you turn your back on the dead now, you'll be trapped between
          the worlds. You'll never be allowed to cross over.
          
          (BEAT)
          
          You'll be alone, Dad. Forever.
          
           
          
          Ashe hesitates a moment, realizing the enormity of what he is
          about to do. It's an agonizing choice.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          I have to stay.
          
           
          
          Danny nods.
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          I know.
          
           
          
          Danny reaches out to touch Ashe's painted face...
          
           
          
          DANNY
          
          (FORLORN)
          
          Good-bye, Dad.
          
           
          
          As Danny says his parting words, the SOUNDS of the world around
          them come rushing back with startling clarity. Danny starts to
          turn away...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Danny, wait...!
          
           
          
          WHAM! Ashe bolts up from the bed of flowers and glass. The spell
          is broken. Was he dreaming...?
          
          No, there's Danny slipping back into the crows, the mask pulled
          down over his face once again.
          
          Ashe reaches for Danny, spinning him around, pulling off the
          mask...
          
          ...only it's not Danny! It's a drunken DWARF with fucked-up teeth
          who's laughing his ass of at Ashe. Ashe recoils, horrified, then
          spins around, suddenly finding himself face to face with...
          
          JUDAH
          
          standing just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of
          his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes
          are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a
          feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his
          campanile.
          
          Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close
          so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath
          -- two sides of a coin.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Tell me, Ashe. Do you every get the feeling we're all just dead
          men on leave?
          
           
          
          ASHE

          Judah flings Ashe backwards...
          
          Ashe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a .45. He FIRES
          into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice...
          
          Judah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning. Wisps
          of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest.
          
          Ashe stares at Judah, dumbfounded.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What...are...you?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you
          know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school?
          
           
          
          Judah lashes out with the rope. Ashe spins and falters. Incredibly,
          he finds himself feeling pain.
          
          Judah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the
          next, driving Ashe back...
          
          Ashe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees. He reaches to his
          mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood. Ashe shakes
          his head to clear it.
          
          Judah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back...
          
          ...but Ashe springs back to his feet. He tries to strike Judah.
          Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight. We hear bones snapping.
          
          CRACK! Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around
          and collapses...
          
          Ashe tries to push himself up by his hands. He coughs, spitting
          up more blood, crawls forward...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          What... did you do to me...?
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          I've tasted the blood of the Crow and taken your power.
          
           
          
          WHOOSH! Judah whips the rope about, snapping the end around Ashe's
          neck, dragging him off his feet.
          
          Judah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready
          to devour its prey.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You're flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die like any other
          man.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Go to hell.

          Sarah sobs quietly, still chained to the pillar. A figure suddenly
          appears at her side -- Sibyl. Sarah looks up...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          What...?
          
           
          
          Sibyl produces a key from within her robes. She places the key
          in the lock on Sarah's manacles. With a turn of the key, the
          manacles fall away and Sarah is free.
          
          Sarah looks back at the blind oracle, uncertain.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Why are you doing this?
          
           
          
          Sibyl fixes Sarah with her blind stare.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          Ashe needs you now. More than ever.
          
           
          
          Sibyl raises her other hand. She's holding one of the misericords
          which she extends to Sarah.
          
           
          
          SIBYL
          
          Go to him.
          
           
          
          Sarah takes the misericord and racees for the end of the campanile,
          towards a beckoning doorway and a stairwell beyond. Printed on
          a grime-smeared placard nearby are the words...
          
          "THIS IS NOT AN EXIT"
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes through the doorway, heedless.
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CITY STREETS - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Judah plants his foot on Ashe's chest, tightening the chain around
          Ashe's throat.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend.
          
           
          
          Ashe clutches at the rusty chain links which bite into his flesh,
          choking.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Look at you, bleeding like a stuck pig. Where's your precious
          strength? Where's your power?
          
          (drawing closer, whispering)
          
          You're nothing now, Ashe, not even a ghost.
          
           
          
          Judah rises. He grabs a hold of the chain, pulling...
          
          ASHE
          
          down the street. Ashe SCREAMS as his body is dragged across the
          asphalt...
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, ELEVATOR - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes into a rickety old elevator, pulling the accordion-style
          security gate shut. She punches the "DOWN" arrow on the tarnished
          control panel. With a lurch and HUM the elevator car starts its
          journey downward.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREET, MOVIE PALACE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Judah has dragged Ashe over to the East side of the street, in
          front of an old movie palace. He leaps atop one of the vending
          stalls and clambers onto the marquee itself.
          
          JUDAH
          
          shouts to the crowds below, his eyes on fire.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You want death?! Here he is, people!!! Take a good look!!!
          
           
          
          Even as Ashe fights to free himself of the chain, Judah loops
          one end of it over a street lamp. He jumps from the marquee,
          using his body weight to pull Ashe from the ground...
          
          ASHE
          
          is dragged up into the air, dangling above the faces of the crowd.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREET, JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sarah rushes out the front entrance of the tower, into the Day
          of the Dead crowd which swarms below. She pushes through the
          mob, trying to fight her way across the street.
          
           
          
          EXT. CITY STREET - MOVIE PALACE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Ashe swings like a puppet from Judah's improvised hangman's noose.
          His coat and short have been all but torn to shreds.
          
          Judah drags down on the chain harder, lifting Ashe even higher,
          tightening the noose. He secures the chain on a hydrant, then
          strolls forward, inspecting his work. Judah circles Ashe, grinning
          like the cat who swallowed the canary.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Now don't we look pretty...
          
           
          
          Ashe struggles, choking, causing...
          
          THE TATTERED PAINTING
          
          of Danny's that Ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free.
          It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet.
          
          Judah kneels, picking it up. As he unfolds the painting, we see
          that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood. He tilts it this
          way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of
          the piece.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          Nice. If you prick him, does he not bleed?
          
           
          
          Judah looks up at Ashe, his eyes full of crazed humor, then he
          very deliberately tears the painting to shreds, letting the pieces
          fall away into the night wind.
          
          Judah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied
          back...
          
          WHACK! Ashe SCREAMS. Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into
          oblivion. With every stroke of the switch the crowd CHEERS.
          
          CLOSE ON ASHE
          
          His eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede...
          
          ASHE'S POV
          
          The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front
          and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering
          at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell...
          
          .. and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the
          front of the crowd...
          
          SARAH
          
          lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller
          aside...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Get away from him!
          
           
          
          Judah turns. Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye. Judah,
          momentarily blinded, falls back...
          
          Sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant...
          
          ASHE
          
          falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp.
          He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back
          up...
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Sarah, get back!
          
           
          
          Too late. Judah has torn the misericord from his eye. He rushes
          up to Sarah and...
          
          ...THUNK! Drives it deep into her chest.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          SARAH!!!
          
           
          
          Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle.
          She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the
          wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then
          falls back.
          
          Silence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted.
          
          Ashe drops by Sarah's side. She stares up at the sky, eyes wide
          with wonder...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          The crows...I can see them coming...
          
           
          
          SARAH'S POV
          
          Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the
          sky.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been
          burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason
          is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled
          animal fury.
          
          Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling
          back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear
          through Judah's chest, impaling him!
          
          Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck
          through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but
          even so, he's laughing hysterically...
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          You can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power.
          
           
          
          Ashe's eyes boil with hatred.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity
          of pain to call upon...
          
           
          
          Ashe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          And the pain gives me strength.
          
           
          
          ASHE'S PALMS
          
          As we watch the stigmata close themselves up, blood drawing itself
          back into the wounds.
          
          Ashe raises his arms to the sky, gesturing to the crows which
          spin high above his head.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          TAKE HIM!!!
          
           
          
          EXT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal
          wave. They descend on Judah as one entity, SCREAMING down from
          the heavens like a storm of razor blades.
          
           
          
          JUDAH
          
          NO!!!
          
           
          
          We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide
          with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him.
          
          JUDAH
          
          lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits the sky as the
          myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb.
          
          DOWN IN THE STREET,
          
          Ashe returns to Sarah's side, lifting her up off the ground and
          cradling her in his arms.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You can't die, Sarah... I stayed for you.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          (GASPING)
          
          There's a balance that needs to be kept...someone had to cross
          over...
          
           
          
          Sarah takes a ragged breath, wincing as a wave of pain washes
          over her.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I didn't want it to be you...
          
           
          
          Sarah looks up at Ashe, tries her level best to smile. She's
          at death's door now - one foot already over the threshold. Her
          face is pale, having lost so much blood. Tears spill down Ashe's
          cheeks, causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          (in anguish)
          
          I can't go with you, Sarah. I have to stay here now.
          
          (cursing his fate)
          
          I have to stay.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Do you love me?
          
           
          
          Ashe nods.
          
          Sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her neck
          on the chain. She tugs at the chain, snapping it apart. She holds
          the ring out to Ashe.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Take...this...
          
           
          
          Ashe takes the ring from Sarah. She closes Ashe's hand around
          the ring, gripping his fist tightly.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          I'll wait for you. Forever, if I have to.
          
           
          
          She shuts her eyes, riding through another wave of pain.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Oh God...
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          Listen...if two people really love each other...
          
           
          
          She inhales sharply. Breathing has become a labor for her now.
          
           
          
          SARAH
          
          ...nothing can keep them apart.
          
          (her voice fading)
          
          ...nothing.
          
           
          
          Ashe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him. It's the
          only thing he has left to cling to.
          
          SARAH'S POV
          
          Ashe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light. We're falling away
          from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we hear a FLUTTERING
          OF WINGS.
          
          ON SARAH'S FACE
          
          Her eyes lose focus. Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms. She's
          gone.
          
          Ashe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time.
          
          Ashe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking
          back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks.
          
          And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors
          the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying
          in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked
          celebrants.
          
          Ashe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms. He turns to leave...
          
          THE DAY OF THE DEAD CROWD
          
          slowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading
          away down the street. It's almost as if, by silent consensus,
          the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this
          night.
          
          ASHE
          
          moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms. The people
          close ranks behind him and we...
          
          CUT TO:
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sibyl stands over the camera obscura. On the table's focusing
          surface we see the street below.
          
          ASHE
          
          is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent
          witnesses.
          
          SIBYL
          
          nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a
          smile cross her lips.
          
          Sibyl turns and exits the camera obscura.
          
           
          
          INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
          
           
          
          Sibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered.
          Removing a pair of scissors from within her robes, Sibyl cuts
          the thread which binds the beetle.
          
          THE STAG BEETLE,

          table, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Sibyl follows suit, gathering her robes about her and stepping
          on into the darkness.

          The same church we visited the night before. Ashe, still carrying
          Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary.
          
          The church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down
          in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest,
          leaving her in a state of repose. He stands, taking in one last
          look.
          
          As Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken
          to earlier.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          Why are you still here?
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          Because I have nowhere left to go.
          
           
          
          Ashe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the
          daylight beyond.
          
           
          
          PRIEST
          
          What will you do, then?

          This city is filled with shadows. One more won't make it any
          darker.
          
           
          
          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN
          
           
          
          Ashe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway. He
          reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had
          given to him...
          
          CLOSE ON THE RING
          
          as Ashe turns it over in his hands, seeing the word "FOREVER"
          inscribed on the inside of the band. He slips it on his finger.
          
           
          
          GRACE (O.S.)
          
          (CONCERNED)
          
          Are you all right?
          
           
          
          Ashe looks up to see...
          
          GRACE,
          
          the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of the
          film. She's looking good now, clean of the poison that once possessed
          her. And damned if she isn't holding Gabriel in her arms.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Long night, huh?
          
           
          
          Gabriel MEOWS to Ashe. Ashe reaches out and scratches the cat's
          ear.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Isn't he cool? I found him on the street. I was going to take
          him home with me.
          
           
          
          ASHE
          
          You should. Looks like he needs a home.
          
           
          
          GRACE
          
          Well, see ya.
          
           
          
          She smiles at him and starts off down the street. Gabriel turns
          around in Grace's arms and peers back at Ashe from over her shoulder.
          
          Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light,
          watching them. We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope
          that someday he and Sarah will be reunited.
          
          As we hold on Ashe's face, Sarah's VOICE-OVER begins.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)

          The same scene as the beginning of our film. We've made a circle.
          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying towards
          the camera in slow motion.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter
          Heaven...
          
           
          
          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK,
          galloping after the Crow.
          
           
          
          SARAH (V.O.)
          
          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day, they will be reunited...
          
           
          
          As the dark rider comes towards us, we realize that it's Sarah
          whose baleful eyes are now shining behind the irony mask war
          paint.

          each on their respective steeds. Worlds apart, and yet, somehow
          traveling the same road.
          
          We are intercutting faster and faster, until the sound of HOOFBEATS
          and the MOTORCYCLE'S ROAR are indistinguishable.
          
          Until the two figures themselves begin to blur.

           Harvey Dent was needed. He was
           everything Gotham has been crying
           out for. He was...a hero. Not the
           hero we deserved - the hero we
           needed. Nothing less than a knight,
           shining...

                         
          The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice.
          The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates...

          Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent.

                          GORDON
           But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his
           friend. And it will be a very long
           time before someone inspires us the
           way he did.
          Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his
          eulogy.
           I believed in Harvey Dent.
          And we FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY

          Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third
          Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man.

                         

          EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

          An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
          fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
          stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
          Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
          vehicle.
          The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
          Man.

          Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
          briefcase.

                         

                          DRIVER
           He wasn't alone.
          CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
          Pavel.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You don't get to bring friends.

           They are not my friends.

           Don't worry, no charge for them.

                          CIA MAN
           Why would I want them?

                          DRIVER
           They were trying to grab your
           prize. (Smiles.) They work for the
           mercenary. The masked man.

          The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

          The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed.
          CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.

           What are you doing in the middle of
           my operation?

          Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
           The flight plan I just filed with
           the Agency lists me, my men, and
           Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
           you.
          CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
          1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

                         

                          CIA MAN

           FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON

           PAVEL?!

                         
          Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
          Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

                          CIA MAN

           HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO

           TRY NEXT?!

                         
          The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

                          CIA MAN

           TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE

           WEAR THE MASK?!

                         
          The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
          man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

                          CIA MAN

           LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

                         

           THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)
           Or he's wondering why someone would
           shoot a man before throwing him out
           of an aeroplane.

                         
          CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

                          CIA MAN
           Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
           talk. Who are you?

                         

                          THIRD PRISONER
           We are nothing. We are the dirt
           beneath your feet. And no one cared
           who I was until I put on the
           mask...

                         
          CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
          hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
          eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

           4.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Who we are does not matter. What
           matters is our plan.

                          CIA MAN

                          (FASCINATED)
           If I pull this off, will you die?

                          BANE
           It would be extremely painful.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You're a big guy -

                          BANE
           For you.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (UNNERVED)
           Was being caught part of your plan?

                          BANE
           Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
           offer in favor of yours. We had to
           know what he told you about us.

           DR. PAVEL
           Nothing! I said nothing!

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Why not just ask him?

                          BANE
           He would not have told us.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You have methods.

                          BANE
           Him, I need healthy. You present no
           such problem.
          CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
          tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
          looming over it, dangerously close...

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The plane lurches. The noise is building.

                          SERGEANT
           Sir?

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Well congratulations, you got
           yourselves caught. What's the next
           step of your master plan?

                         

                          BANE
           Crashing this plane...

                         

          EXT. MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on
          tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each
          side...

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane
          above. CIA Man looks at Bane.

                          (RISING)
           With no survivors.
          A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
          outside the window. Bang -

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach
          grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start
          to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted,
          unnaturally.

                         

          INT. COCKPIT, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward.

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms,
          legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
          Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's
          neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
          plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
          Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
          him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

                         

                         

          EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

          The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
          helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then
          opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting
          gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down,
          by Dr. Pavel.

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
          swinging out as the tail explodes.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
          Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
          A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
          seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
          the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

                         
          Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
          surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
          runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
          horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,
          drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the
          body...

                         
          An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
          out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.

           7.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Friend. They expect one of us in
           the wreckage.
          The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.

                         

                          HOODED MAN 2
           Have we started the fire?

                          BANE

                          (NODS)
           The fire rises.
          Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
          Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
          Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.

                         

                          BANE
           Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
           fear...
          Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
          vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

                         

                          BANE
           That comes later.
          Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
          them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.
          Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,
          and we -

          EXT. GOTHAM - EVENING

          Drifting over the vast city...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent Day may not be our
           oldest public holiday...
          ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           But we're here tonight because it's
           one of the most important...
          ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...

           8.

                         

                         

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
           against organized crime and, yes,
           ultimately, his sacrifice, have
           made Gotham a safer place than it
           was at the time of his death, eight
           years ago...
          ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
          addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.

                         

                          MAYOR
           This city has seen a historic
           turnaround. No city is without
           crime. But this city is without
           organized crime because the Dent
           Act gave law enforcement teeth in
           its fight against the mob. Now
           people are talking about repealing
           the Dent Act. And to them I
           say...not on my watch.
          Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
           I want to thank the Wayne
           Foundation for hosting this event.
           I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
           tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
           in spirit...

                         
          High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Now I'm going to give way to an
           important voice...

                         
          Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
          sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Commissioner.

                         

                          GORDON
           Congressman.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
           these things?
          Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
          cuts in.

           9.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           No one has. Not in years.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           He can tell you about the bad old
           days, when the criminals and
           corrupt ran this town with such a
           tight grasp that people put their
           faith in a murderous thug in a mask
           and a cape. A thug who showed his
           true nature when he betrayed the
           trust of this great man - (Turns to
           picture of Dent.) And murdered him
           in cold blood.
          The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
          grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Sweetheart, not so fast with the
           chow.

                          MAID
           (turns, tight smile)
           Shrimp balls?
          The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
          Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
           about Harvey Dent...

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
           We're gonna be here all night.

                          GORDON
           Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
           so simple, Congressman.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           But I'll let him tell you himself -
           Commissioner Gordon?
          Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
          speech. Thinks.

                          GORDON
           The truth...?
          INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens
          Gordon's son with a handgun.

           10.

                         

                         
          Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
           I have written a speech telling the
           truth about Harvey Dent...
          Gordon folds up his speech.
           Maybe the time isn't right...
          Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
          mutters under his breath.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Thank Christ for that...

                          GORDON
           Maybe right now all you need to
           know is that there are a thousand
           inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
           direct result of the Dent Act.
           These are violent criminals,
           essential cogs in the organized
           crime machine that terrorized
           Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
           all I should say about Harvey
           Dent's death is this...it has not
           been for nothing.
          The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
          People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
          Foley.

                         

                          GORDON
           The second shift reports in?

                          FOLEY
           On your desk. But you should put in
           some more time with the Mayor -

                          GORDON
           That's your department.

                         
          Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Anyone shown him the crime stats?

                          FOLEY
           He goes by his gut, and it
           continues to bother him, whatever
           the numbers.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Must be popular with the wife.

           11.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           Not really. She took the kids and
           moved to Cleveland.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           He'll have plenty of time for
           visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
           spring.

                          FOLEY
           Really? He's a hero.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           War hero. This is peacetime. Stay
           smart, the job's yours.

                         

                         

          INT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
          Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.

                          MAID 2
           They say he never leaves the East
           Wing.

                          MAID 3
           I heard he had an accident - that
           he's disfigured.

                         
          The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
          died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Till, why are your people using
           the main stairs?
          Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
          plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.

          Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
           tried. He won't see you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
          Her accent is European. Hard to place.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Wayne is as determined to
           ignore important things as trivial
           ones.

           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Don't take it personally, Miranda.

                         
          They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.

           Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
           there with eight-inch nails, peeing
           into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
           of you to let me on the grounds.

                          ALFRED
           The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
           Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
           always a pleasure.
          Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.

                          DAGGETT
           Why waste your time talking to the
           man who threw away your investment
           on some save-the-world vanity
           project? He can't help you get your
           money back. But I can.

                          MIRANDA
           I could try explaining that a
           save-the-world project, vain or
           not, is worth investing in,
           whatever the return. I could try,
           Mr. Daggett, but you understand
           only money and the power you think
           it buys, so why waste my time,
           indeed?

                         
          She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

          Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
          Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
          He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
          something. He slowly limps into the next room...

                         

          INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
          Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
          target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
          bow. Picks up his cane.

                          MAID
           I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
           It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

                         
          Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.

                          MAID
           Although you don't have the long
           nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
           scars...
          She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.

                          WAYNE
           Is that what they say about me?

           14.

                         

                          MAID
           It's just that...nobody sees you...

                         
          Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

                          WAYNE
           That's a beautiful necklace.
           Reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother. It can't be the same
           one - her pearls are in this safe -
          He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau, revealing a safe door...
           - which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable.

                         
          ...which swings open with an awkward creak.

                          MAID
           Oops. No one told me it was
           uncrackable.

                         
          The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

                          WAYNE
           I'm afraid I can't let you take
           those.

                         
          She smiles at him. Moves towards him.

                          MAID
           Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
           more than I would beat up a
           cripple.
          She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
           Of course, sometimes exceptions
           have to be made.

                         
          The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
          He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

                         

          EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
          white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
          pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
          slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAID
           Can I have a ride?
          The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           You read my mind.

          Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.

                          ALFRED
           Miss Tate was asking to see you
           again.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's very persistent.

                          ALFRED
           And quite lovely, in case you were
           wondering.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I wasn't.

                          ALFRED
           What are you doing?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Examining print dust. We've been
           robbed.

                          ALFRED
           And this is your idea of raising
           the alarm?

                          WAYNE

                          (SHRUGS)
           She took the pearls. Tracking
           device and all.

                          ALFRED
           She?

                         

                          WAYNE
           One of the maids, perhaps you
           should stop letting them in this
           side of the house.

           16.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps you should learn to make
           your own bed, then. Why are you
           dusting for prints?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not. She was.

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
          to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.

           YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
           Sir?

                         
          A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.

                          BLAKE
           I didn't want to bother you up
           here, but they're looking for you.

                         

                          GORDON
           What's the problem, son?

                          BLAKE
           Congressman Gilly's wife's been
           calling. He hasn't made it home
           from the Wayne Foundation event.

                          GORDON
           That's a job for the police?

                          BLAKE
           Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
           I've only logged half a dozen
           arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
           the streets you cleaned 'em good.
           Pretty soon we'll be chasing
           overdue library books.
          Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.

                          BLAKE
           But here you are. Like we're still
           at war...

                          GORDON
           Old habits.

           17.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           Or instinct.

                          GORDON
           What's your name, son?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, sir.

                          GORDON
           You have something you want to ask
           me, Officer Blake?

                          BLAKE
           It's that night. This night, eight
           years ago. The night Dent died.

                         

                          GORDON
           What about it?

                          BLAKE
           The last confirmed sighting of the
           Batman. He murders those people,
           takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
           Dent's neck...then just vanishes?

                          GORDON
           I'm not hearing a question, son.

                         
          Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you want to know who we was?
          Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
          his fingers across its rusted shell.

                          GORDON
           I know exactly who he was. (Turns
           to Blake.) He was Batman.

                         
          Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Let's go see about the
           Congressman's wife...

           18.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne?
          Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.

                         

                         

          INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

          Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor.

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
          lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
          a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
          where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You haven't been down here in a
           long time...

                          WAYNE
           Just trying to find out more about
           our jewel thief. I ran her prints
           from the photos she handled -
          Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
          suspect.
           - but she was wearing someone
           else's fingerprints. She's good.

                          ALFRED
           She may be. But we have the trace
           on the necklace.

                         

                          WAYNE
           We do, so I cross-referenced the
           address she went back to with
           police data on high-end
           B-and-E's...

                         
          Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
           Selina Kyle. The databases are full
           of close calls, tips from fences...

           19.

                         
          Newspaper headlines appear -

          THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL

          HEIST.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's good, but the ground is
           shrinking beneath her feet.

                         

                          ALFRED
           We should send the police before
           she fences the pearls.

                          WAYNE
           She won't. She likes them too much.
           And they weren't what she was
           after.

                          ALFRED
           What was she after?

                         

                          WAYNE
           My fingerprints. There was printer
           toner mixed with graphite on the
           safe. Gives you a good pull, and
           it's untraceable.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Fascinating. Maybe you should
           exchange notes over coffee.

                          WAYNE
           Now you're trying to set me up with
           a jewel thief?

                          ALFRED
           At this point, sir, I would set you
           up with a chimpanzee if I thought
           it would bring you back into the
           world.

                          WAYNE
           There's nothing out there for me.

                         

                          ALFRED
           And that's the problem. You hung up
           the cape and cowl, but never moved
           on. You won't get out there and
           find a life. Find someone -

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (BITTER)
           I did find someone, Alfred.

           20.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           I know. And then you lost them.
           That's part of living, sir. But
           you're not living - you're waiting.
           Hoping for things to go bad again.

                         
          Wayne says nothing.
           Remember when you left Gotham?
           Before all this. Before Batman.
           Seven years you were gone. Seven
           years I waited. Hoping that you
           wouldn't come back.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
           Every year I took my holiday. I'd
           go to Florence. There's a café by
           the Arno... Any fine evening I
           would sit there and order a Fernet
           Branca...
          INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
           I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
           that one day I'd look across the
           tables, and see you. Sitting there
           with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
           You wouldn't say anything to me, or
           me to you, but we'd both
           know...that you'd made it. That you
           were happy.

                         
          INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
          closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
           I never wanted you to come back to
           Gotham. I knew there was nothing
           there for you but pain and tragedy,
           and I wanted more for you than
           that. I still do.
          Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.

                         

                         

          EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY

          Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
          DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.

                         

                          DWP MAN
           They wash up a couple times a
           month. More when in gets colder -
           homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
           We had to pull him to clear the
           basin, but other than that we
           didn't touch him...

           21.

                         

                         
          They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
          a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.

                          ROSS
           What?

                         

                          BLAKE

          Blake is talking to Father Reilly.

                          FATHER REILLY
           Jimmy hadn't been here for months.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          FATHER REILLY
           You know why, Blake - he aged out.
           We don't have the resources to keep
           boys on after sixteen -

                          BLAKE
           The Wayne Foundation gives money
           for that -

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Not for two years now.

                          BLAKE
           He has a brother here, right?

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Mark. I'll tell him.

                          BLAKE
           I'd like to, if that's okay.

           22.

                         

                         

          EXT. PLAYGROUND, ST. SWITHIN'S - MOMENTS LATER

          Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten.

                          BLAKE
           I'm sorry.

                         
          Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.

                          BLAKE
           What was he doing in the tunnels?

                         

                          MARK
           Lot of guys been going down the
           tunnels when they age out. Say you
           can live down there. Say there's
           work down there.

                         

                          BLAKE
           What kind of work are you gonna
           find in the sewers?

                          MARK
           More than you can find up here, I
           guess.
          Blake considers this. Troubled.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

          Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
          in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
          over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.

                         

                          STRYVER
           You brought a date?

                          SELINA
           I like having someone around to
           open doors for me.

                         
          Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
          Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.

                          SELINA
           Right hand. No partials.
          Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
          up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.

           23.

                         

                         

                          STRYVER
           Very nice.
          He pockets the envelope.

                          SELINA
           Not so fast, handsome. You got
           something for me?

                          STRYVER
           Oh, yes.

                         
          Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
          joins them at the table. Selina smiles.

                          SELINA
           I don't know what you're going to
           do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
           I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
          As Stryver checks the envelope again -

                          SELINA
           You don't count so good, huh?

                          STRYVER
           I count fine.
          The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.

                         

                          STRYVER
           In fact, I'm counting to ten right
           now...
          Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
          blinks.

                          SELINA
           Okay, okay -

                         
          She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
          himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.

                          SELINA
           My friend is waiting outside. Just
           hit 'send'...

                         
          Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
          options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
          door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
          Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.

           24.

                         

                         

                          JEN
           Place is a little dead.

                          SELINA
           (takes envelope, tense)
           It'll liven up in a minute, trust
           me.

                          JEN
           Everything okay?

                         

                          SELINA
           Great. Catch you later.
          Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.

                          SELINA
           It would've been a lot easier to
           just give me what we agreed.

                          STRYVER
           We can't have loose ends. And even
           in that dress, no one's going to
           miss you.

                          SELINA
           No. But my friend over there...?
          Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
          nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...

                          SELINA
           Every cop in the city's missing
           him.

                         
          Across the bar, the TV on mute -

          MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
          Stryver looks at Selina.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Cute. But they're not gonna be
           looking in a place like this.

                          SELINA
           I don't know... You did just use
           his cell phone.
          Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
          Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
          descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
          SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs

           25.

                         

                         
          Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
          other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
          Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.

                          SWAT
           It's alright, Miss. Just stay down

                          -
          The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
          through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
          weapons.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
          bar, clutching his bleeding leg.

                         

                          SELINA
           Keep some pressure on that,
           sweetheart.
          She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar.
          Moves for the door.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN

                          (WEAK)
           Call me?

                         

                         

          EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina waltzes out - right into Blake. She feigns panic.

                          SELINA
           There's a man in there - he's
           bleeding!

                          BLAKE
           It's okay, Miss. It's okay.

                         
          Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
          He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
          truck and into the night.

           26.

                          (INTO RADIO)
           I've got the Congressman - bullet
           to the leg, but he's okay.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
          race around a corner into a smaller passage.
          A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
          jumps out, gun drawn.

                         
          The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
          tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
          counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
          The passage is empty.

                         
          The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -

                          GORDON
           Manhole!

                         
          He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
          Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.

                          GORDON
           You three, down with me. You two,
           head down to cover the next exit -

                         

                          SWAT
           Where -?

                          GORDON
           Get the DWP down here, now!

                         
          Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...

          fall in behind...

           27.

           Where's the DWP guy?

                         

                          BLAKE
           They went down there?

                          FOLEY
           (shaking his head)
           And Gordon took SWAT in after them.

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
          corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
          the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
          ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
          tearing through the tunnels.

           This one's alive. (Looks closer.)
           Jesus. It's the Police

                          THUG 2
           What do we do?

                         

                          THUG 1
           Take him to Bane.
          The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
          As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
          men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
          and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
          Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
          stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
          between two waterfalls, into -

          They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
          firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
          line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...

                         

                          BANE
           Why are you here?
          The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.

                         

                          THUG 1
           Answer him!
          Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.

           I'm asking you.

           It's the Police Commissioner.

                         

                          BANE
           And you brought him down here?

           No, he's alone -
          Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
          Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.

           Search him. Then I will kill you.
          The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
          gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
          Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
          the papers. Unfolds them...

                         
          As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
          rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...

                          THUG 2
           He's dead.

                         
          Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...

                          BANE
           Then show me his body.

                         

                          THUG 2
           That water runs to any one of the
           outflows - we'd never find him.
          Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.

                         

                          BANE
           Give me your GPS.
          Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
          jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.

           30.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Follow him.

                          THUG 2
           Follow him?

                         
          Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
          Mercenary.

                          BANE
           Track him. Make sure both bodies
           will not be found. Then brick up
           the south tunnel.

                         

          EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT


                         
          Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something
          stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the
          raging waters - Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls
          him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying...

                         

                         

          INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform.

                          BLAKE
           I need to see Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
           unscheduled calls. Even from police
           officers.

                         

                          BLAKE
           And if I go get a warrant, in the
           investigation of Harvey Dent's
           murder? Would that still count as
           unscheduled?

                         

                         

          INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.

                         

                          WAYNE
           What can I do for you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

           31.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm sorry to hear that -

                          BLAKE
           He chased a gunman down into the
           sewers. When I pulled him out he
           was babbling about an underground
           army. A masked man called 'Bane'.

                          WAYNE
           Shouldn't you be telling this to
           your superior officers?

                          BLAKE
           I did. One of them asked if he saw
           any giant alligators down there. He
           needs you. He needs the Batman.

                         

                          WAYNE
           If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
           the Batman he must be in a bad way

                          -

                         

                          BLAKE
           He doesn't know or care who you
           are. (Off look.) But we've met
           before. When I was a kid. At the
           orphanage. See, my mom died when I
           was small. Car accident, I don't
           really remember it. But a couple of
           years later my dad was shot over a
           gambling debt. I remember that just
           fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
           of people who know what it feels
           like, do they? To be angry. In your
           bones. People understand, foster
           parents understand. For a while.
           Then they expect the angry kid to
           do what he knows he can never do.
           To move on. To forget.

                         
          Wayne stares at Blake.

                          BLAKE
           So they stopped understanding and
           sent the angry kid to a boys' home
           - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
           by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
           figured it out too late. You have
           to hide the anger. Practice smiling
           in the mirror. Like putting on a
           mask. You showed up one day in a
           cool car, pretty girl on your arm.

           32.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE (CONT'D)
           We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
           billionaire orphan. We made up
           stories about you. Legends. The
           other boys' stories were just that.
           But when I saw you I knew who you
           really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
           that look on your face. Same one I
           taught myself.
          Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.

                         

                          BLAKE
           I don't know why you took the fall
           for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
           believer in the Batman. Even if
           you're not.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Why did you say your boys' home
           used to be funded by the Wayne
           Foundation?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Because the money stopped. Might be
           time to get some fresh air and
           start paying attention to the
           details. Some of those details
           might need your help.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne and Alfred watch Blake drive away.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You checked that name? 'Bane' -

                          ALFRED
           Ran it through some databases. He's
           a mercenary. No other known name.
           Never been seen or photographed
           without a mask. He and his men were
           behind a coup in West Africa that
           secured mining operations for our
           friend John Daggett.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Now Daggett's brought them here?

                          ALFRED
           It would seem so. I'll keep
           digging.

           33.

                         

                         
          Alfred turns to leave.

                          WAYNE
           Why did the Wayne Foundation stop
           funding boys' homes in the city?

                         

                          ALFRED
           The Foundation is funded from the
           profits of Wayne Enterprises...
           (Off look.) There have to be some.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.

                          ALFRED
           I'll get him on the phone -

                         

                          WAYNE
           No. Do we still have any cars
           around the place?

                          ALFRED

                          (LIGHTS UP)
           One or two.

                          WAYNE
           And I need an appointment at the
           hospital. About my leg.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Which hospital, sir?

                          WAYNE
           Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

                         
          Alfred is less excited by this part of the request.

          Moving towards the tall skyscraper downtown.

           MIRANDA (V.O.)
           Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr.
           Wayne was trying to do...

                         

                         

          INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

          Miranda is talking to Lucius Fox at the table.

           34.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           I'm only asking for explanations
           because I think I can help.

                          FOX
           I'll pass along your request. Next
           time I see him.
          Miranda catches something in this.

                          MIRANDA
           He doesn't talk to you either?

                          FOX
           Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has
           his...eccentricities.

                         

                          MIRANDA

                          (RISING)
           Mr. Fox, are you aware that John
           Daggett is trying to acquire shares
           in Wayne Enterprises?

                         

                          FOX
           I was not. But it wouldn't do him
           any good - Mr. Wayne still retains
           a clear majority.
          Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.

                         

                          FOX
           Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.
          Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.

                         

                          FOX
           What brings you out of cryo-sleep
           Mr. Wayne?

                          WAYNE
           I see you haven't lost your sense
           of humor...even if you have lost
           most of my money.

                          FOX
           Actually, you did that yourself.
           See, if you funnel the entire R and
           D budget for five years into a
           fusion project that you then
           mothball, your company is unlikely
           to thrive.

                          WAYNE
           Even with -

                         

                          FOX
           A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
           Wayne Enterprises is running out of
           time. And Daggett is moving in.

                          WAYNE
           What're my options?

                          FOX
           If you're not willing to turn your

                          WAYNE
           I can't, Lucius.

                          FOX
           Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
           Daggett at arm's length while we
           figure out a future for the energy
           program with Miranda Tate - she's
           supported your project all the way.
           She's smart, and quite lovely.

                          WAYNE
           You too, Lucius?

                          FOX
           We all just want what's best for
           you, Bruce. Show her the machine.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'll think it over.

                          FOX
           Anything else?

           No, why?

                          FOX
           These conversations always used to
           end with some...unusual requests.

           I retired.

                          FOX
           Let me show you some stuff, anyway.
          Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden
          elevator.

           I figured you'd have shut this
           place down.

                          FOX
           It was always shut down,
           officially.

                          WAYNE
           But all this new stuff?

                          FOX
           After your father died, Wayne
           Enterprises set up fourteen
           different defense subsidiaries.
           I've spent years shuttering them
           and consolidating all the

           Why?

           Stop them falling into the wrong
           hands. Besides, I thought someone
           might get some use out of them...
          Wayne shakes his head.

                          FOX
           Sure I can't tempt you to
           something? Pneumatic crampons?
           Infrared lenses? Least let me get
           you something for that leg.

           It's fine the use it gets these

           Well, then I have just the thing
           for an eccentric billionaire who

          Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes
          light up.

                          WAYNE
           What's it called?

                          FOX
           It has a long and uninteresting
           Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
           took to calling it the Bat. And
           yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
           black.
          Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.

                         

                          FOX
           Works great except for the
           autopilot.

                          WAYNE
           What's wrong with that?

                          FOX
           Software-based instability. Take a
           better mind than mine to fix it.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Better mind?

                          FOX
           I was trying to be modest. A less
           busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
          Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.

                          WAYNE
           I told you. I retired, Lucius.

                         

                         

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.

                         

                          DOCTOR
           I've seen worse cartilage in knees

                          -

           38.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           That's good -

                          DOCTOR
           No, that's because there is no
           cartilage in your knee. And not
           much of any use in your elbows and
           shoulders. Between that and the
           scar tissue on your kidneys,
           residual concussive damage to your
           brain tissue and general
           scarred-over quality of your
           body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
           cannot recommend that you go
           heli-skiing. About the only part of
           your body that looks healthy is
           your liver, so if you're bored I
           recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
           Wayne.
          Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
          steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
          which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
          frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

                         

          EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne drops three floors...

                         

                         

          INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
          mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
          to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...

                          GORDON
           We were in this together. Then you
           were gone...

                         

                          WAYNE
           The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
           We won.

                          GORDON
           Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
           there's evil rising from where we
           tried to bury it. Nobody will
           listen... The Batman has to come
           back.

           39.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           What if he doesn't exist anymore?

                          GORDON
           He must. He must.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

          Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
          houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
          dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
          picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you - money first -

           YUPPIE (O.S.)
           Goddammit, you took my wallet!

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
          her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
          grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.

                          SELINA
           Get out.

                         

                          YUPPIE
           She took my wallet!
          Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.

                          SELINA
           Now.
          She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
          Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.

                          SELINA
           I told you not to try it with the
           assholes, Jen.

                          JEN
           They're all assholes.

           40.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Okay, the assholes who hit.

                          JEN
           I don't know what he's so upset
           about, he only had sixty bucks in
           here.

                          SELINA
           Probably the watch.

                         

                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Watch?
          Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

          Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
          pulls out. Checking his tracker.

                         

                         

          EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER

          Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
          Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.
          Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...

                         

                          PAPARAZZI
           Another stiff too old to climb out
           of his sports car.

                          PAPARAZZI 2
           No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
           where you been hiding?
          Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
          - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not sure if my assistant put me
           on the guest list -

                          GREETER
           Right through here, Mr. Wayne...

           41.

                         

                         

          INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

          A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
          confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
          He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
          wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
          Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
          only concession to fancy dress.

                          WAYNE
           Miss Tate, isn't it?

                          MIRANDA
           Even before you became a recluse,
           you never came to these things...

                          WAYNE
           True. Proceeds go to the big fat
           spread, not the cause. It's not
           about charity, it's about feeding
           the ego of whichever society hag
           laid it on.

                          MIRANDA
           Actually, this is my party, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           Oh.

                          MIRANDA
           And the proceeds will go where they
           should, because I paid for the big
           fat spread myself.

                          WAYNE
           That's very generous of you.

                          MIRANDA
           You have to invest to restore
           balance to the world. Take our
           clean-energy project...

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sometimes the investment doesn't
           pay off. Sorry.

           42.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
           Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
           about the world doesn't spend half
           his fortune on a plan to save it...
           (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
           it fails that he goes into
           hiding...
          Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
          Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.

                          WAYNE
           Mind if I cut in?
          Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
          Selina by the waist. She glares at him.

                          WAYNE
           You don't seem very happy to see
           me.

                          SELINA
           You were supposed to be a shut-in.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Felt like some fresh air.

                          SELINA
           Why didn't you call the police?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I have a powerful friend who deals
           with this kind of thing. (Admires
           her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
           cat burglar.

                         

                          SELINA
           Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

                          WAYNE
           Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
           Who's your date?

                          SELINA
           His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
           diamonds behind, though. Worried
           they'd get stolen.

           43.

                         

                          WAYNE
          It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
          wouldn't want these folks realizing
          you're a crook not a social
          climber.

                         

                          SELINA
           (flash of anger)
          You think I care what anyone in
          this room thinks about me?

                         

                          WAYNE
          I doubt you care what anyone in
          this room thinks about you.

                          SELINA
          Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
          don't know a thing about me.

                          WAYNE
          Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
          here from your walk-up in Old Town
          - modest place for a master jewel
          thief. Which means either you're
          saving for your retirement - or
          you're in deep with the wrong
          people.

                         

                          SELINA
          You don't get to judge me because
          you were born in the master bedroom
          of Wayne Manor.

                          WAYNE
          Actually, I was born in the Regency
          Room.

                          SELINA
          I started off doing what I had to.
          Once you've done what you had to
          they'll never let you do what you
          want to.

                          WAYNE
          Start fresh.

                         

                          SELINA
          There's no fresh start in today's
          world. Any twelve-year-old with a
          cell phone could find out what you
          did. Everything we do is collated
          and quantified. Everything sticks.
          We are the sum of our mistakes.

           44.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Or our achievements.

                          SELINA
           The mistakes stick better. Trust
           me.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You think that justifies stealing?

                          SELINA
           I take what I need to from those
           who have more than enough. I don't
           stand on the shoulders of people
           with less.

                          WAYNE
           Robin Hood?

                          SELINA
           I'd do more to help someone than
           most of the people in this room.
           Than you.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you're assuming too much.

                          SELINA
           Or maybe you're being unrealistic
           about what's really in your pants
           other than your wallet.

                          WAYNE
           Ouch.

                         

                          SELINA
           You think all this can last?
          Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.

                         

                          SELINA
           There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
           You and your friends better batten
           down the hatches, because when it
           hits you're all gonna wonder how
           you ever thought you could live so
           large and leave so little to the
           rest of us.

                          WAYNE
           Sounds like you're looking forward
           to it.

           45.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           I'm adaptable.

                          WAYNE
           These pearls do look better on you
           then they did in my safe...

                         
          Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
          of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
           But I still can't let you keep
           them.

                         
          The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
          looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears

          Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
          strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
          moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
          Thermos.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You've got the wrong leg, sir.

                          WAYNE
           You start with the good limb so it
           learns your optimum muscle
           patterns.
          Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
          - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
           Now we tighten it up.

                         
          Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
          tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.

                          ALFRED
           It is terribly painful?

           Not bad at all.

                         
          Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
          Wayne across the bridge to the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne, if you're considering

           hear some rumors surrounding Bane.

           I'm all ears.

                         

                          ALFRED
           There is a prison. In a more
           ancient part of the world. A pit.
           Where men are thrown to suffer and
           die. But sometimes, a man rises
           from the darkness. Sometimes...the
           pit sends something back.

           Bane.

                          ALFRED
           Born and raised in a hell on earth.

           Born in a prison?

           No one knows why. Or how he
           escaped. But they know who trained
           him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your

           mentor.

                         
          Wayne takes this in. Shocked.

                          ALFRED
           He plucked Bane from a dark corner
           of the earth and trained him in the
           blackest disciplines of combat,
           deception and endurance. Just like
           you.

                          WAYNE
           Bane was a member of the League of

           That was then. And you can strap up
           your leg and put the mask back on.
           But it won't make you what you
           were.

           say he is, then this city needs me.
          The Batsuit emerges from the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
           Your resources, your
           knowledge...not your body. Not your
           life. That time has passed.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
           Alfred. And I failed.

                          ALFRED
           You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
           Batman, you can't afford to.

                          WAYNE
           That's what you're afraid of - that
           if I go back out there I'll fail.

                         

                          ALFRED
           No. I'm afraid that you want to.

          INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

          A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...
          Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.

                         

                          TRADER 2
           You can't short the stock because
           Bruce Wayne goes to a party -

                          TRADER 1
           Wayne coming back is change. Change
           is either good or bad.

                          TRADER 2
           On what basis?

                         

                          TRADER 1
           I flipped a coin.
          Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
          there negotiating with a Trader.

                         

                          TRADER 3
           No. Rye. I told 'em rye.
          Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
           Alright, I'll take it.

                         
          He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
          At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
          wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
          face.

                         

           FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
           Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
           a camera.) We need faces for
           cameras.

                         
          In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
          the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
          At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
          man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
          the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
          gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
          home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
          floor.
          At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
          The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.

           50.

                         
          In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
          pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.

                         
          Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
          - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
          moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
          Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
          Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
          lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
          Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
          floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
          screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...

                         

                          TRADER 1
           This is a stock exchange, there's
           no money you can steal -
          He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...

                         

                          BANE
           Why else would you people be here?
          Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
          floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
          man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.

                         

                          BANE
           Enter your password. Or I send
           these men to your home.

                         
          Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.
          Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs
          it into the computer - figures race across the screen...

          dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the
          darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die...

                         
          And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -

                          VETERAN COP

          Food Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back - sees
          streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up.

                         
          The engine chokes and dies. The Trader jumps off, shouting
          for the cops. Food Guy turns, pulling his gun. SMASH! - Food
          Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as
          BATMAN races by on the Bat-Pod.

          Batman pulls up, overlooking the intersection - pulls a

          and fires.

          Shoeshine Man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks,

           exist in any database? Little too
           good to be true.

                          CATWOMAN
           You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
           prototype stage -

                         

                          DAGGETT
           That's why I bought them. But they
           had nothing. It was a gangland
           myth.

                         
          Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
          drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not
          Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
          Daggett by the throat, threatening him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Stay back!
          They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
          onto his gun.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'm not bluffing!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           They know...

                         
          All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
          it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.

                          BATMAN
           They just don't care.

                         
          As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
          forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
          fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
          fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
          another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
          miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.

           62.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           You've got to be kidding.

                          BATMAN
           No guns. No killing.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Where's the fun in that?
          As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
          the far edge.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Come on!
          Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
          She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
          sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
          Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
          gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
          cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
          hisses shut, taking bullets from above.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           My mother warned me about getting
           into cars with strange men -

                          BATMAN
           This isn't a car.
          Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
          downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
          but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
          the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

                         

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           See you around -
          Batman steps down after her.

                         

                          BATMAN
           You're welcome.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had it under control.

           63.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Those weren't street thugs - they
           were trained killers. I saved your
           life. In return I need to know what
           you did with Bruce Wayne's
           fingerprints.
          Catwoman looks at him. Considering.

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne wasn't kidding about a
           'powerful friend'. I sold his
           prints to Daggett. For something
           that doesn't even exist.

                          BATMAN
           I doubt many people get the better
           of you.

                          CATWOMAN
           Hey, when a girl's desperate...

                         

                          BATMAN
           What were they going to do with
           them?

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know. But Daggett seemed
           pretty interested in that mess at
           the stock market.
          Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
          searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Miss Kyle -?
          But she is gone.
           So that's what that feels like.

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

          Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
          at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
          brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
          water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
          Alfred brushes water off his suit.

                          ALFRED
           Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell
           the neighbors you got yourself a
           new leaf-blower?

           64.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           We bought all the neighbors.
          Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.

                          ALFRED
           From the look of the television
           coverage, you seem to have your
           taste for wanton destruction back.

                          WAYNE
           (pulls out USB drive)
           I retrieved this.

                          ALFRED
           Shouldn't the police be gathering
           the evidence?

                         

                          WAYNE
           They don't have the tools to
           analyze it.

                          ALFRED
           They would if you gave them to them

                          -

                          WAYNE
           One man's tool is another man's
           weapon.

                         

                          ALFRED
           In your mind, perhaps. But there
           aren't many things you couldn't
           turn into a weapon.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred. Enough. The police weren't
           getting it done -

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps they would've if you
           haven't made a sideshow of
           yourself.

                          WAYNE
           Perhaps you're upset you were
           wrong.

                          ALFRED
           Wrong?

           65.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           You thought I didn't have it in me.
          Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.

                          ALFRED
           You don't. You lead a bloated
           police force on a merry chase with
           some fancy new toys from Fox. What
           about when you come up against him.
           What then?

                         
          Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...

                          WAYNE
           I'll fight harder, I always have.

                         

                          ALFRED
           When you had something to fight
           for. What are you fighting for now?
           Not your life.
          Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
          hand.

                          ALFRED
           Take a good look. At his speed, his
           ferocity, His training. I see the
           power of belief. Of the fanatic. I
           see the League of Shadows
           resurgent.

                          WAYNE
           You said he was excommunicated.

                         

                          ALFRED
           By R¯'s al Gh¯l. Who leads them

                          A U
           now?

                          WAYNE
           R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of

                          A U
           Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's
           just a mercenary, and we have to
           find out what he's up to.
          Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Trades of some kind. Coded...
          The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.

           66.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Is that -?

                          WAYNE
           Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.

                         
          Wayne pulls out the USB, rises.
           Get this to Fox - he can crack the
           code and tell us what trades they
           were executing.

                         
          Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

          As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'll get this to Fox. But no more.
          Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've sewn you up and set your
           bones...but I won't bury you. I've
           buried enough members of the Wayne
           family.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You'd abandon me?

                          ALFRED
           You see only one end to your story.
           Leaving is all I have to make you
           understand: you aren't Batman
           anymore - you have to find another
           way. You used to talk about
           finishing. About life beyond that
           awful cave -

                         

                          WAYNE
           Rachel died knowing we'd decided to
           be together. That was my life
           beyond this cave and I can't just
           move on. She didn't. She couldn't.

                         
          Alfred considers this. Looks away.

                          ALFRED
           What if he had? What if she wasn't
           intending to make a life with you?

           67.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           She was, I can't change that -

                          ALFRED
           What if, before she died, she'd
           written a letter? Explaining that
           she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
          Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -

                          ALFRED
           And what if, to spare you
           pain...I'd burned that letter?
          Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.

                          WAYNE
           Why would you say such a thing?

                          ALFRED
           Because I have to make you
           understand.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You're lying.

                          ALFRED
           Because you are as precious to me
           as you were to your own mother and
           father and I swore to them that I
           would protect you and I haven't.

                          WAYNE
           You're lying!

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've never lied to you. Except when
           I burned Rachel's letter.
          Wayne turns on the old man, furious.

                         

                          WAYNE
           How dare you use Rachel to stop me!

                          ALFRED
           I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.
           Maybe it's time we all stopped
           trying to outsmart the truth and
           just let it have its day. I'm
           sorry.

           68.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
           world, then shake hands?!

                          ALFRED
           No. I know what this means -

                          WAYNE
           What does it mean, Alfred?!

                          ALFRED
           It means your hatred. It means
           losing the person I've cared for
           ever since I heard his first cries
           echo through this house. But it
           might also mean saving your life.
           And that is more important.

                         
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to
          say and says it quietly and calmly.

                          WAYNE
           Goodbye, Alfred.

                          (QUIET)
           Goodbye, Bruce.
          Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.

                         

                         

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Wayne is woken by the doorbell.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing
          gown, he can't resist one tentative.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred?
          But Alfred is gone.

                         

                         

          INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised.

           69.

           Answering your own door?

                          WAYNE
           Yes. Could you decode the trades on
           that drive?

                         
          Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:

          BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...

                         

                          FOX
           I didn't need to. Page three.
          Wayne turns the page:

          WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...

                         

                          FOX
           It seems you made a series of large
           put options on the futures
           exchange. Verified by thumb print.
           The options expired at midnight
           last night.
          Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.

                          FOX
           Long term we may be able to prove
           fraud, but for now...you're
           completely broke. And Wayne
           Enterprises is about to fall into
           the hands of John Daggett.

                          WAYNE
           The weapons - we can't let Daggett
           get his hands on Applied Sciences -

                          FOX
           Applied Sciences is shut up tight,
           and off the books. The energy
           project is a different story.

                          WAYNE
           Miranda Tate. We need to convince
           the board to get behind her. Let's
           show her the reactor -

                          FOX
           We're meeting her there in
           thirty-five minutes. You better get
           dressed.

          EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY

          A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the
          towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.

                          MIRANDA
           You brought me out here to show me
           a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?

                         

                          FOX
           Bear with me, Miss Tate.
          They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.

                         

                         

          INT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS

          Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her.

                          FOX
           Keep your hands and feet inside the
           car at all times.
          He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
          as the office becomes an elevator into -

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

          They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...

                          MIRANDA
           This is it, isn't it?

                         

                          FOX
           The reactor is beneath the river so
           that it could be instantly flooded
           in an event of a security breach.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Is Bruce Wayne really that
           paranoid?

                          FOX
           I'm gonna plead the fifth on that
           one.
          Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
          figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I thought you might like to see
           what your investment built.

           71.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           No radiation, no fossil fuels.
           Free, clean energy for an entire
           city.

                          WAYNE
           If it worked. It doesn't.
          Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
          electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
          Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.

                          WAYNE
           Ignition, yes. But no chain
           reaction.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You've built a lot of security
           around a damp squib.
          Nothing.
           About three years ago a Russian
           scientist published a paper on
           weaponized fusion reactions. One
           week later your reactor started
           developing problems... (Looks at
           Wayne.) I think this machine works.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Miranda, if it were operational,
           the danger to Gotham would be too
           great.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Would it make you feel better to
           know that the Russian scientist
           died in a plane crash six months
           ago?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Someone else will work out what Dr.
           Pavel did. Someone else will figure
           out how to turn this power source
           into a nuclear weapon. I need you
           to take control of Wayne
           Enterprises and this reactor.

                          MIRANDA
           And to do what with it?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Nothing. Until we can find a way to
           guarantee its safety.

           72.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And if we can't?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Decommission it. Flood it.

                          MIRANDA
           Destroy the world's best chance for
           a sustainable future?

                         

                          WAYNE
           If the world's not ready. Yes.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce, if you want to save the
           world you have to start trusting
           it.

                          WAYNE
           I'm trusting you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Doesn't count. You have no choice.

                          WAYNE
           I could've flooded this chamber any
           time in the last three years. I'm
           choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
           that's not the easiest thing for
           me. Please.
          His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.

                         

                          FOX
           We have a board meeting to get to.

          The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
          seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.

                          DAGGETT
           I'd like to point out that we have
           a non-board member here. Highly
           irregular, even if it is his family
           name above the door...
          All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.

                          DAGGETT
           Into the ground, sir. Anybody
           disagree? Check the value of your
           shares this morning. Gambling on
           crazy futures didn't just lose Mr.
           Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a
           lot of money. He needs to leave.

                         

                          FOX
           I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.

                         
          Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.

                          DAGGETT
           Let's get down to business.

          INT. LOBBY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of
          Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters.

                          REPORTER
           Wayne, how's it feel to be one of
           the people?!

          Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.

           BLAKE (O.S.)
           Looks like you need a lift.
          Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.

          INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

          Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.

                          DAGGETT
           How the hell did Miranda Tate get
           the inside track on the Wayne
           board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
           Was she sleeping with Wayne?

                          STRYVER
           Not that we know of -

                          DAGGETT
           Clearly you don't 'know of'
           anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!

                         

                          STRYVER
           We told him it was urgent -

                          DAGGETT
           Then where is the masked -

                         

           BANE (O.S.)
           Speak of the devil...
          Daggett turns. Bane is already there.

                          BANE
           ...and he shall appear.

                          DAGGETT
           What the hell's going on?

                          BANE
           The plan is proceeding as expected.

                          DAGGETT
           You see me running Wayne
           Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
           Your stock exchange hit didn't
           work, friend. And now you've got my
           construction crews working all
           hours around the city? How's that
           supposed to help my company absorb
           Wayne's?

                         

                          BANE

                          (TO STRYVER)
           Leave us.

                          DAGGETT
           You stay right there! I'm in
           charge!
          Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.

                         

                          BANE
           Do you feel in charge?
          Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.

                         

                          DAGGETT
           I've paid you a small fortune -

                          BANE
           And that gives you power over me?

                         
          Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.

                          DAGGETT
           What is this?

                          BANE
           Your money and infrastructure have
           been important. Till now.

                          DAGGETT
           What are you?

                         

                          BANE
           Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
           borrowed time you've all been
           living on...

                         
          Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
          hands...

                          DAGGETT
           You are true evil...

                         

                          BANE
           I am necessary evil.
          Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.

          INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.

                          BLAKE
           When you began...why the mask?

                         

                          WAYNE
           To protect the people closest to
           me.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You're a loner with no family.

                          WAYNE
           There are always people you care
           about. You just don't realize how
           much until they're gone. (Collects
           himself.) The idea was to be a
           symbol. Batman could be anybody,
           that was the point.

                          BLAKE
           It was damn good to see him back.

                          WAYNE
           Not everybody agrees.

                          BLAKE
           They'll figure it out in the end.

                          WAYNE
           Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

                          BLAKE
           Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
           of tunnel records and a flashlight.
           I could use some help.

                          WAYNE

           (smiles, sheepish)
           Actually, no.
          Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
          The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

          Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.

                         

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you, money first.

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           I don't think so.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.

                          SELINA
           He's not a mark.
          Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.

                          SELINA
           And he doesn't have a cent to his
           name, anyway.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
          embarrassed.

                          SELINA
           Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
           it's more that you've got right
           now.

                          WAYNE
           Actually, they're letting me keep
           the house.

                         

                          SELINA

                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           The rich don't even go broke same
           as the rest of us, huh?

           78.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           (spots her bag)
           Vacation?

                          SELINA
           Let's just say that I've incurred
           the wrath of some people less
           susceptible to my charms than you.

                          WAYNE
           My powerful friend hopes to change
           your mind about leaving.

                          SELINA
           And how would he do that?

                          WAYNE
           By giving you what you want.

                          SELINA
           It doesn't exist.

                          WAYNE
           He says it does. He wants to meet.
           Tonight.

                          SELINA
           Why?

                         

                          WAYNE
           He needs to find Bane. He thinks
           you'd know how.

                          SELINA
           Tell him I'll think about it.
          Wayne nods, starts to leave.

                          SELINA
           Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all
           your money.

                          WAYNE
           No, you're not.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for -

           79.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.

                          FOLEY
           Can we help you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           John Daggett's body was found in a
           dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
           might like to know.

                         

                          GORDON
           Why?

                          BLAKE
           Because Daggett's name is all over
           the permits I pulled to map the
           tunnels under Gotham.
          Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.

                         

                          BLAKE
           MTA maintenance, sewer
           construction...

                          GORDON

                          (TO FOLEY)
           Where did you get to with the
           tunnel searches?

                          FOLEY

                          (TO BLAKE)
           Remind me to tell the detail to
           keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
           We've had teams down there, but
           it's a huge network -

                          GORDON
           Get more men, work a grid. I want
           him found.

                          FOLEY
           Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
           on it.

                         
          Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.

                          GORDON
           This is good work. Lose the uniform
           - you're working for me now. We
           could use some hotter heads around
           here.

           80.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           This could just be a coincidence.

                          GORDON
           You're a detective now, son, you're
           not allowed to believe in
           coincidence anymore.
          Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)

          Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
          driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Nobody's answering.
          Wayne turns to find Miranda there.

                          WAYNE
           No. I'm on my own now.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Do you have keys?
          Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Never needed them...
          She takes his hand.

                          MIRANDA
           Let's find a window.

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)

          They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
          rain.

                          MIRANDA
           Fox worked the board like you've
           never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
           and he's not happy.
          Wayne sets down the newspaper:

          FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM

           81.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Hope you don't like me for your
           money.
          Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Suffering builds character.
          Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           I'll take care of your parents'
           legacy, Bruce.
          Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Who's this?
          Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...

                          MIRANDA
           Where's Alfred?

                          WAYNE
           He left. Taking everything.
          Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
          again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.

                          MIRANDA
           What's that?

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SHEEPISH)
           I think my power's been shut off.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER (NIGHT)


                         
          Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.

                          WAYNE
           You're pretty good at that.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           When I was a child we had almost
           nothing. But on the nights we had a
           fire, we felt very rich indeed.
          She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.

           82.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I assumed your family was wealthy.

                          MIRANDA
           Not always. Not when I was young.

                         
          He traces a scar on her shoulder.

                          MIRANDA
           An old mistake.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I've made a few myself.
          She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.

                          MIRANDA
           More than a few... (Smiles.) We
           could leave. Tonight. Take my
           plane. Go anywhere we wanted.

                          WAYNE
           Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
          She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
          other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.

                         

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

          Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
          her for a moment, then slips out...

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.

                         

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT


                         
          The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and
          main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons.

                         

          INT. MIA TUNNEL - LATER


                         
          Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...

                          CATWOMAN
           Don't be shy.

                         
          ...Batman is there.

           83.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne says you can get me the
           'Clean Slate'.

                          BATMAN
           That depends.

                          CATWOMAN
           On what?

                          BATMAN
           On what you want it for. I acquired
           it to keep it out of the wrong
           hands.

                          CATWOMAN
           Still don't trust me, huh? How can
           we change that?

                          BATMAN
           Start by taking me to Bane.

                          CATWOMAN

                          (SHRUGS)
           You asked.
          Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
          into a service tunnel...

                         

                         

          INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.

                          CATWOMAN
           From here, Bane's men patrol the
           tunnels...and they are not your
           average brawlers.

                          BATMAN
           Neither am I.
          Catwoman swings into a -

                         

          INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.

                          CATWOMAN
           He's behind you.

           84.

                         

                         

                          MERCENARY

                          (SPINS)
           Who?
          Batman hangs upside down behind him.

                         

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Me.
          Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
          Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
          off his feet by darkness - he screams...
          Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
          Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.

                          CATWOMAN
           Just a little further.
          A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
          is deep inside.

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had to find a way to stop them
           trying to kill me.

                          BATMAN
           You've made a serious mistake.

           BANE (O.S.)
           Not as serious as yours, I fear.
          Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.

                          BATMAN
           Bane.

                          BANE
           Let's not stand on ceremony here,
           Mr. Wayne.

                         
          Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.
          Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
          his fist.

                          BANE
           Peace has cost you strength.
           Victory has defeated you.

           85.

                         

                         
          Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
          Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
          chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
          flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.

                         

                          BANE
           Theatricality and deception are
           powerful agents...to the
           uninitiated.
          Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.

                         

                          BANE
           But we are initiated, aren't we,
           Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
           you betrayed us...

                         

                          BATMAN
           Us? You were excommunicated. From a
           gang of psychopaths.

                          BANE
           Now I am the League of Shadows,
           here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's

                          A U
           destiny...
          Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
          waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
          Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.

                         
          Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
          Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...

                          BANE
           You fight like a younger man.
           Nothing held back. No reserves.
           Admirable. But mistaken.
          Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
          turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.

                         

                          BANE
           You think darkness is your ally.
           But you merely adopted the dark. I
           was born in it. Formed by it...

                         
          In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...

                          BANE
           I didn't see the light until I was
           already a man. And by then it was
           nothing to me but blinding...

           86.

                         

                         
          Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
          his grasp.

                          BANE
           The shadows betray you, because
           they belong to me...

                         
          Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
          pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
          Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
          chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...

                          BANE
           I will show you where I've made my
           home while preparing to bring
           justice. Then...I will break you.

                         
          A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through
          cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST
          over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing:
          Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's
          weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.

                          BATMAN
           No...

                          BANE
           Your precious armory. Gratefully
           accepted. We will need it.

                         

          INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment...

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches.

                         

                          BANE
           I wondered which would break first
           - your spirit...

                         
          Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him

          HIGH.
           ...or your body.
          Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
          with a horrific CRACK.

           87.

                         

                         
          In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
          pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
          Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the
          hollow eyes of his trophy...

                         
          Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -

           FADE TO BLACK.

                          FADE IN:

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Blake's cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows.
          Nothing.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY

          Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat,
          bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab.

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (INTO RADIO)
           Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him
           I've got a line on the
           Congressman's kidnapping.

                         
          Blake pulls out to follow.

                         

          INT. TERMINAL, GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop
          staring at her - ducks down a service hallway.

                         

          INT. SERVICE HALLWAY, AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying
          make-up.

                          UNIFORM
           Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your
           ticket and identification, please.

                         
          Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.

                          SELINA
           Would you mind?

           88.

                         

                         
          She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the
          brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his
          head.

                         

                         

          INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the
          far end - turns - Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand.

                         

                         

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in.

                          BLAKE
           I showed your picture to the
           Congressman and guess what?

                          SELINA
           Don't tell me, still in love?

                          BLAKE
           Head over heels. Pressing charges,
           though.
          Blake lays a police file down with a thump.
           You've made some mistakes, Ms.
           Kyle.

                         

                          SELINA
           Girl's gonna eat.

                          BLAKE
           You have an appetite. Why run? You
           can't hide from us with this
           record.

                          SELINA
           Maybe it's not you I'm running
           from.

                          BLAKE
           Who then? Bane? What do you know
           about him?

                         

                          SELINA

                          (QUIET)
           That you should be as afraid of him
           as I am.

           89.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           We can offer you protection...
          Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
          off the tape, moves to the door.

                         

                          BLAKE
           When I spotted you, I was looking
           for a friend...Bruce Wayne.
          Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Did they kill him?

                          SELINA
           I'm not sure.

                         
          And we -

                          CUT TO:
          BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights:
          LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -

                         

          INT. STONE CELL - DAWN

          Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in
          the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is
          painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting
          at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.

                          WAYNE
           Why didn't you just kill me?

                         

                          BANE
           You don't fear death. You welcome
           it. Your punishment is to be more
           severe.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SCATHING)
           You're a torturer...

                          BANE
           Yes. But not of your body. Of your
           soul.
          Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.

           90.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Where am I?

                          BANE
           Home.

                         
          Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
          sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
           Where I learned the truth about
           despair. As will you. (Rises.)
           There is a reason that this prison
           is the worst hell on earth...
          Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
          hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
          well...
           Hope. Every man who has rotted here
           over the centuries has looked up to
           the light and imagined climbing to
           freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
           like shipwrecked men turning to sea
           water from uncontrollable thirst,
           many have died trying. I learned
           that there can be no true despair
           without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
           as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
           its people hope to poison their
           souls. I will let them believe they
           can survive so that you can watch
           them clamber over each other to
           stay in the sun...
          Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
           You will watch as I torture an
           entire city to cause you pain you
           thought you could never feel again.
           Then, when you have truly
           understood the depths of your
           failure, we will fulfill R¯'s al

                          A
           Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy

                          U
           Gotham. And when it is done...when
           Gotham is ashes...then you have my
           permission to die.
          Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.

                         

                         

          EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - DAY

          A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks
          up at the formidable grey building.

           91.

                         

          INT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

          Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls.

                         

                          GUARD
           We're locking her up in here?

                          WARDEN
           The Dent Act allows non-segregation
           based on extraordinary need. First
           time she broke out of women's
           correctional she was sixteen.
          Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...

                         

                          HUGE INMATE
           Little closer, baby...

                          SELINA
           Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?

                         
          Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands
          between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his
          arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...

                          WARDEN
           She'll be just fine.

                         

                         

          INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

          Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           I don't see the need for a board
           meeting on the energy project -

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce got a lot of things right.
           Keeping the board in the dark
           wasn't one of them...
          Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...

                         

                         

          INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

          The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table - Bane.

                          BANE
           This meeting is called to order.
          Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.

           92.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Chair and President. I also need
           one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,
           would you care to nominate?

                         

                          FREDERICKS
           No. I volunteer.
          The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
          Mercernaries round the three up.

                         

                          FOX
           Where are you taking us?

                          BANE
           Where you buried your resources.
           The bowels of Gotham.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Gordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated
          position as Blake watches.

                         

                          GORDON
           So you think our friend is gone
           again?

                          BLAKE

                          (GRAVE)
           This time...he might not be coming
           back.
          Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.

                         

                          FOLEY
           Okay, Commissioner, you were right.

                          GORDON
           What's happened?

                         

                          FOLEY
           Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne
           Enterprises board. He let most of
           them go, but took three down into
           the sewers.

                         

                          GORDON
           No more patrols, no more hide and
           seek. Send every available cop
           down there to smoke him out.

           93.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           The Mayor won't want panic -

                          BLAKE
           So it's a training exercise.

                         
          Foley looks at Gordon.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry for not taking you

                          SERIOUSLY -

                         

                          GORDON
           Don't apologize for believing the
           world's in better shape then it
           is...just fight to make it true.

                         
          Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.

                          GORDON
           Not you. You're telling me the
           Batman's gone. So you chase up the
           Daggett leads, any way you can.

                         
          Blake nods.

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his
          parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the
          wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He asks if you would pay us to let
           you die. I told him you have
           nothing.

                          WAYNE
           Do it for the pleasure.

                         
          The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.

                          PRISONER
           They pay me more than that to keep
           you alive.

                         
          A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully
          to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong
          Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other
          Prisoners.

           94.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He will try the climb.
          Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant
          grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.

                         
          Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot
          leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as
          Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he
          swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong
          Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Has anyone made it?

                          PRISONER
           Of course not.

                         
          The Blind Prisoner barks at him.

                          WAYNE
           What does he say?

                         

                          PRISONER
           He says there is one who did. A
           child...
          INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.

                         

                          PRISONER
           A child who had been born in this
           hell...

                          WAYNE
           Bane.

                         

                          PRISONER
           An old legend. Nothing more.
          The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Don't.

                          PRISONER
           Whatever they want you to
           see...it's happening soon.

          EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

          A SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing
          boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of
          Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking
          weapons, using flashlights...

                         

          INT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel
          follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox.

                          BANE
           Turn it on.

                         
          Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.

                          BANE
           I only need one other board member.
           There are eight more waiting
           upstairs.

                         

                          FOX
           I won't do it.
          Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Alright, stop.
          She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
          beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.

           96.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Lucius, you'll kill this man and
           yourself, and barely slow them
           down.
          Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
          Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel
          is transfixed.

                         

                          BANE
           Do your work.
          Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages.
           Take them to the surface. People of
           their status deserve to see the
           next era of western civilization.
          Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.

           We're seeing literally thousands of

                          MAYOR
           A training exercise, that's all. If

          The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds...

           I've been to half Daggett's cement

           poured for underground

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Anything strange about the
           pourings?
          Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Honestly, Commissioner, I don't
           know anything about civil
           engineering.

                         

                          GORDON
           But you know about patterns. Keep

           (to his men)
           Pull the core out of the reactor.

                         

           DR. PAVEL

                          (HORRIFIED)
           You can't. This is the only power
           source capable of sustaning it - if
           you move it, the core will decay in
           a matter of months.

                          BANE
           Five, by my calculations.

                         

           DR. PAVEL
           And then it will go off.

           Pavel, I hope so.

                          WORKER
           Boss is about to leave.
          Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Hey.
          The Driver turns.

                          BLAKE
           That was you outside the stock
           exchange, right?

                          DRIVER
           When?

                         

                          BLAKE

           were trying to pull onto Castle
           Street and your truck shut them
           out.

                         

                          DRIVER
           Oh yeah. You're that cop -

                          BLAKE
           Detective, now.

                         
          Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...

                          BLAKE
           And as a detective...I'm not
           allowed to believe in coincidences

                          ANYMORE -
          Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
          knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him.
          The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the
          Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires
          behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one
          catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,
          gasping, kneels beside the Driver.

                          BLAKE
           What were you doing?! What?!

                         
          The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses
          is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.

          Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some
          empty barrels...
           Commissioner, they've got
           Polyisobutylene here... (Looks

           'The things we did in Harvey's name
           brought desperately needed security
           to our streets... But I can no
           longer live with my lie. It is time
           to trust the people of Gotham with

          Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd.
           Do you accept this man's
           resignation?

                          BLAKE
           These men, locked up in Blackgate
           for eight years, denied parole
           under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.

                          GORDON
           A lie to keep a city from burning
           to the ground. Gotham needed a
           hero, someone to believe in -

                          BLAKE
           Not as much as it does now. But you
           betrayed everything you stood for.

                         

                          GORDON
           (looks at Blake)
           There's a point. Far out there.
           When the structures fail you. When
           the rules aren't weapons anymore,
           they're shackles, letting the bad
           get ahead. Maybe one day you'll
           have such a moment of crisis. And
           in that moment, I hope you have a
           friend like I did. To plunge their
           hands into the filth so you can
           keep yours clean.

                          BLAKE
           Your hands look pretty filthy to
           me, Commissioner.

           He was the prison doctor. A
           morphine addict who incurred the

           Including your masked friend.

                          PRISONER
           Many years ago, during a time of
           plague, Bane was attacked by other
           prisoners. The doctor's fumbling
           attempts to repair the damage left
           him in perpetual agony. The mask
           holds his pain at bay.

                          WAYNE
           Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was
           he born here?

                         

                          PRISONER
           The legend is that there was a
           mercenary working for the local
           warlord who fell in love with his
           daughter. They married in secret.

                         
          The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms.

                          PRISONER
           When the warlord found out, he
           condemned the mercenary to this
           pit. But then exiled him instead.

           warlord's daughter had secured his
           release, but he couldn't know the
           true price of his freedom. She had
           taken his place in the pit.

           Innocence cannot flower

           This is Bane's prison now. Bane
           would not want this story told.
          The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled
          upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine.
           You have a protruding
           vertebra...I'm going to force it
           back...

          The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams.

           You stay like this. Until you
           stand.

          Following Selina through rooms strewn with trash, empty
          bottles and sleeping partygoers. She spots a family
          photograph, glass smashed. A hand lands on her shoulder.

                          JEN
           Who's that?

                         

                          SELINA
           This was someone's home.

           Now it's everyone's home.

                         
          Selina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by.

                          JEN
           'Storm's coming', remember? This is
           what you wanted.

                         

                          SELINA
           No. It's what I thought I wanted.

          The Prisoner unties the rope from Wayne's chest. Wayne
          stands. Just. Then walks.

           Why build yourself?

           Here? There? What's the difference?
          Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body...

                         

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

          Wayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed
          Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners
          gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the
          light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners
          get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands.
          Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the
          next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS.
          His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet -
          the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The
          Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner
          lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away.

                         

                          PRISONER
           I told you it could not be done.

                          WAYNE
           You told me a child did it...

          older now, moves to the climbing wall
           A child born in hell.
          INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down
          - making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off
          Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn.

           hardened by pain...

          The 18-wheeler pulls up. A line of Gothamites waits

          Three plain-clothes Special Forces Men emerge from the

          they exit.

           How can we trust you?

                          SPECIAL FORCES 1
           Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones,
           Special Forces.

                         

                          GORDON
           Captain, glad to have you here.

           120.

                         

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           How many of you are there?

                          GORDON
           Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly.
           But the men trapped underground
           number almost three thousand.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What kind of shape they're in?

                         

                          GORDON
           They've been getting water, food.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could we break them out?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries
           guarding the outflow south of
           Ackerman Park, blow the rubble,
           you've got a hole big enough for
           ten at a time. I'm in contact with
           my partner - they're waiting for
           the day.

                          SPECIAL FORCES 2
           Men who haven't seen daylight for
           three months?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Men with automatic weapons who
           haven't seen daylight in three
           months.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What about the bomb? The satellites
           can't see any radiation hot
           spots...

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

          Blake scouts with Jones. A rumble makes them turn.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           They keep it on a truck - it must
           have a lead-lined roof. They move
           it constantly.

           CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.)
           But you know the truck?

           121.

                         

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           They've got three of them. The
           routes don't vary much.
          Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street.
          Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger
          counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers
          stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What about the triggerman?

                          GORDON
           No leads. It's a bluff - Bane
           wouldn't give control of that bomb
           to someone else.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We can't take that chance. Until we
           have the triggerman, we just track
           the device, smuggle men over -

                          BLAKE
           While Gotham lives under a warlord,
           like in some failed state?

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Dial it back, officer. This
           situation is unprecedented. We
           can't do anything to risk millions
           of lives.

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (TO GORDON)
           Aren't you gonna tell him?!

                          GORDON
           Captain, things are more
           complicated than you think. There's
           somebody you need to meet. Blake?
          Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.

          Blake leads them into empty offices. Cots and makeshift
          furnishings line the offices and corridors.

                          BLAKE
           I was up here looking for a vantage
           point. Found the people who run the
           corporation who owns it living
           here.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Which corporation?

           FOX (O.S.)
           Wayne Enterprises.
          Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd
           like you to brief the Captain.
          Captain Jones indicates Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           Miss Tate is fully aware of the
           situation.

                          MIRANDA
           And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
           have to take responsibility for it.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Why?

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Because, Captain, we built it.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           You built the bomb?

                         

                          FOX
           It was built as a fusion reactor.
           The first of its kind. Bane turned
           the core into a bomb, then
           disconnected it from the reactor.

           123.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           And here's the important part.

                          FOX
           As the device's fuel cells decay,
           it's becoming increasingly
           unstable...until the point of
           detonation.

                          BLAKE
           The bomb's a time bomb.

                         

                          FOX
           And it will go off. In twenty-three
           days.
          Captain Jones reels at this news.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Bane's revolution is a sham. He's
           watching Gotham rearrange its
           deckchairs while the whole ship's
           going down. Your appeasement plan
           might not be as practical as you
           thought.
          Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could you disarm it?

                          FOX
           I don't know, But I could reconnect
           it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We'd have to let the Pentagon know.

                          WAYNE
           My body makes the jump.

                          BLIND PRISONER

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           Survival is the spirit. The soul.

                          WAYNE
           My soul's as ready to escape as my
           body.

                         

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Fear is why you fail.

                          WAYNE
           I'm not afraid. I'm angry.

                         
          Wayne throws punches...focused.

                         

          INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners
          look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts
          climbing, determined.
          He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
          it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
          face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
          A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
          at Wayne, hanging upside down.

                          SKINNY PRISONER
           Shouldn't you get him down?
          The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.

           126.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He'll keep.
          As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -

          looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.

           THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.)
           And why do we fall?

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT

          Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.

                          BLIND PRISONER

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           You do not fear death. You think
           this makes you strong. This makes
           you weak.

                          WAYNE
           Why?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           How can you move faster then
           possible? Fight longer than
           possible? If not from the most
           powerful impulse of the spirit. The
           fear of death. The will to survive.
          Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.

                          WAYNE
           I do fear death. I fear dying in
           here while my city burns with no
           one there to save it.

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Then make the climb.

                          WAYNE
           How?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           As the child did. Without the rope.
           (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find
           you again.
          Wayne considers this.

           127.

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - MORNING

          Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
          folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.

                          PRISONER
           Supplies for your journey?
          Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
          Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
          Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
          to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
          makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
          below the Prisoners start a low chant.
          As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
          EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
          circle up to the opening above...
          Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
          breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
          again...then he jumps.

                         
          Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
          And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
          The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
          ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.
          He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached
          to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

          A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,
          industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down
          into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is
          Stryver, Daggett's functionary.

                          STRYVER
           I want to see Bane! There's been a
           mistake! Take me to Bane!
          Fox watches him dragged upstairs...

           128.

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - MOMENTS LATER

          A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.

                          STRYVER
           There's been a mistake! Where's
           Bane?!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           There's been no mistake, Mr.
           Stryver.

                         
          Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.

                          CRANE
           You are Philip Stryver, executive
           vice-president of Daggett
           Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)
           The same Philip Stryver who for
           years lived like a prince off the
           blood and sweat of people less
           powerful?

                         

                          STRYVER
           Call Bane! I'm one of you!
          Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.

                          CRANE
           Bane has no authority here. This is
           merely a sentencing hearing. The
           choice is yours, death or exile.
          Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
          'Death'.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Exile.

                          CRANE

                          (SMASHES GAVEL)
           Sold...to the man in the cold
           sweat!
          Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY

          Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the
          ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering.

           129.

                         

                         

                          BLACKGATE INMATE
           Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -
           you're dead in minutes.

                          STRYVER
           Has anyone made it?
          The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
          ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking...
          Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.

                         

                         

          INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit
          around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch.

                         

                          GORDON
           Where the hell are they? It's not
           like we have a lot of time, here.

                          COP
           How long?

                          GORDON
           The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've
           got about eighteen hours to do
           something.

                         

                          COP
           To do what?

                          GORDON
           We mark that truck. Get a GPS on
           it, then we can start thinking
           about how to take it down.
          The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops.
          Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.

                         

                          GORDON

                          (LOW)
           That's it?
          Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.

                         

                          GORDON
           Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?!
          Gordon heads for the door.

           130.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           You shouldn't be out on the streets

                          -

                         

                         

          EXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

          Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.

                          FOLEY'S WIFE
           Jim. He's not here -

                         
          Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.

                          GORDON
           You're sending your wife to the
           door when the city's under
           occupation?!
          Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.

                          FOLEY
           Wait in the kitchen, honey.

                         

                          GORDON
           What did you do, bury your uniform
           in the backyard?

                          FOLEY
           Jim, you saw what they did to those
           Special Forces.

                          GORDON
           You forgotten all the years we went
           out on patrol with every gangbanger
           wanting to plant one as soon as our
           backs were turned?

                          FOLEY
           This is different and you know it.
           These guys run the city - the
           government's done a deal with them

                          -

                          GORDON
           Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a
           vice. That's not a deal -

                          FOLEY
           You move against Bane, the
           triggerman's gonna hit the button -

           131.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           You think he's given control of
           that bomb to one of 'the people'?!
           You think this is part of some
           revolution? There's one man with
           his finger on the button - Bane.

                          FOLEY
           We have to keep our heads down
           until they can fix this. If you
           still had family here maybe you'd -

                         

                          GORDON
           This only gets fixed from inside
           the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,
           I'm not asking you to walk down
           Grand in your dress blues. But
           we've got to do something before
           this maniac blows us all to hell.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -

                         

                          GORDON
           Keep your head down? What's that
           gonna do tomorrow, when that thing
           blows?

                          FOLEY
           You don't know that's going to
           happen.
          Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           I hear you're looking for men,
           Commissioner.
          Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           How about me, instead?

                          GORDON
           Miss Tate, I can't ask you -

                         

                          MIRANDA
           My company built it.

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne built it.

           132.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And he wanted to destroy it. It was
           me who didn't listen. Please.
          Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.

                         

                          GORDON
           Let's go.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two
          Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.

                          GANGBANGER
           You steal from us, you little
           bastard?
          They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
          apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is
          grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.
          Selina catches the apple.

                         

                          SELINA
           You boys know you can't come into
           my neighborhood without asking
           politely.

                         
          Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him
          stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,
          howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.

                          SELINA
           Never steal anything from someone
           you can't outrun, kid.

                          KID
           Now you're gonna take it.

                         
          Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.

                          SELINA
           Just tax.
          She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.

                         

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           Pretty generous, for a thief.
          Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
          but weathered. Beard, work clothes.

           133.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           You came back. I thought they'd
           killed you.

                          WAYNE
           Not yet.

                          SELINA
           If you're expecting an apology -

                          WAYNE
           It wouldn't suit you. I need your
           help.

                          SELINA
           And why would I help you?

                         
          Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.

                          WAYNE
           For this. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          SELINA
           You're gonna trust me with that?
           After what I did to you?

                          WAYNE
           I admit I felt a little let down.
           But I still think there's more to
           you. In fact, I think for you -
           (indicates USB) this isn't a tool,
           it's an escape route. You want to
           disappear. Start fresh.

                         
          She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.

                          SELINA
           Start fresh? I can't even get off
           this island.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I can give you a way off. Once
           you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I
           need you to find out where they're
           holding him. Then take me in.

                         

                          SELINA
           Why do you need Fox?

                          WAYNE
           To save this city.

           134.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Who says it needs saving? Maybe I
           like it this way.

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you do. But tomorrow that
           bomb's going off.

                          SELINA
           Get your powerful friend on the

           I'm trying. But I need Fox.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY


                         
          Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking
          down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.

                          GORDON
           Stay further up the block. (Points
           at Men.) They're gonna cross the
           street and try and slow the truck
           down. As it approaches, hit this
           button. If the needle hits two
           hundred - give me the signal and I
           mark the truck. Okay?

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (OVER RADIO)
           Heads up.

                         
          Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end
          of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men
          walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the
          road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the
          signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS
          locator at the lower part of the truck...

                         
          Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.

                          GORDON
           Got it.

                         
          They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an
          ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.

                          MERCENARY
           Commissioner Gordon, you're under
           arrest.

           135.

                         

                          GORDON
           On whose authority?

                          MERCERNARY
           The people of Gotham.

                         
          Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and
          the other Cops being rounded up and led away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY


                         
          Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come
          down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They
          kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to
          his aid.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 1
           Find this one a spot, he's got a
           big day tomorrow.
          They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 2
           We all do. It's not every day you
           bag Bruce Wayne...
          Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods
          at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda
          comes over.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce?

                         

                          FOX
           You picked a hell of a time to go
           on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           How long until the core ignites?

                         

                          FOX
           That bomb goes off in twelve hours.

                          WAYNE
           Unless we can connect it to the
           reactor.

                          FOX
           If you can get it there. I'll find
           a way to plug it back in.
           (Indicates Miranda.) Can you get
           Miranda out?

           136.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Not tonight. I'm sorry.

                          MIRANDA
           Do what's necessary.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (TO FOX)
           Tonight I need you.

                          FOX
           What for?

                          WAYNE
           To get me back in the game.
          Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to spoil things, boys, but
           Bane wants these guys himself...
          The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
          up.

                          WAYNE
           I won't forget about you.

                          MIRANDA
           I know.

                         

          EXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman
          spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to
          the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.

                          FOX
           I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           He should be so lucky.
          And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.

                         

                         

          INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

          Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.

                          WAYNE
           Any move I make against Bane or the
           bomb - the triggerman sets it off.

                          FOX
           They can't be using radio or cell -
           too much interference. Infrared
           doesn't have the range. It could
           only be micro-burst long wave...
          Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment:
          mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...

                          WAYNE
           Could you block it?

                          FOX
           Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance
           mount from the Bat. You remember
           where you parked?
          Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING (LATE DAY)

          Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides.

                          CRANE
           The charges are espionage and
           attempted sabotage... Do you have
           anything to say in your defense?

                          GORDON
           No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort
           of due process is this?

                          CRANE
           More than you give Harvey's
           prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt
           is determined, this is merely a
           sentencing hearing. What's it to
           be, death or exile?

                          GORDON
           Crane, if you think we are going
           willingly out onto that ice, you've
           got another think coming.

                          CRANE
           Death, then?

           138.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           Looks that way.

                          CRANE
           Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By
           exile.

                         
          He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men,
          indicates Miranda.

                          BANE
           Bring her to me.

          Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath

                         

                          LUCIUS
           I think it's time to talk about my

          Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun
          sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.

                          FOX
           She fly pretty well?

                          WAYNE
           Even without the autopilot...

                          FOX
           Autopilot? That's what you're there
           for.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - NIGHT


                         
          Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.
          A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,
          then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...
          Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of
          liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Light it up.

           139.

                         

                         
          Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -
          jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the
          ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a

          BAT...

          Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.

          A Mercenary nervously approaches Bane's back.

           Sir?

                         
          Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.

                          MERCENARY
           You think it's really him?

          Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them
          moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a
          dark figure. The figure steps into the light - it is
          Blake...

          EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

          Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open
          manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb
          out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake
          is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,
          sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops
          onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman
          takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is
          finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.

                          BLAKE
           You missed a spot.
          Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.

                         

                          BATMAN
           If you're working alone, wear a
           mask.

                          BLAKE
           No one cares who I am.

                          BATMAN
           The mask is not for you. It's to
           protect the people you care about.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Huh. And you always seem to know
           where those people are. How is
           that?

                          BATMAN
           I lost someone once. Since then I
           break into their homes when they're
           sleeping and implant a tracking
           device on the back of their neck.

                         
          Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses
          Blake a mini-mine.

          They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
          the blasts barely move any rubble.

                         

                          BLAKE
           No offense, but you got anything
           bigger in that belt?

                          BATMAN
           That's to warn the men on the other
           side.
          Batman disappears into the shadows.

                          BLAKE
           But how do we -?
          KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.

                          BLAKE
           Okay.

                         
          Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but
          glad to be alive and carrying guns...

                          BLAKE
           What now?

                         

                          BATMAN
           All-out assault on Bane...but you
           need to get the people you care
           about across the bridge.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          BATMAN
           In case we fail. Lead an exodus
           across the bridge. Save as many
           lives as you can.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you need me here?

                         

                          BATMAN
           You've given me an army. Now go.
          Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.

           142.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Thank you.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Don't thank me yet.

                          BLAKE
           I might not get a chance later.

                         
          Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at
          his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,
          revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up.

                          CATWOMAN
           Oh, you shouldn't have...
          She hops on, feeling the controls.

                         

                          BATMAN
           The mid-town tunnel's blocked by
           debris, but the cannons give you
           enough firepower to make a path for
           people.

                         
          Catwoman marvels at the controls...

                          BATMAN
           To start it, you -

                         

          VARROOOM!

                          CATWOMAN
           I got it.

                         

                          BATMAN
           We've got forty-five minutes to
           save this city -

                          CATWOMAN
           No, I've got forty-five minutes to
           get clear of the blast radius,
           because you don't stand a chance
           against these guys.

           143.

                         

                          BATMAN
           With your help I might.

                         
          She shakes her head.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'll open that tunnel, then I'm
           gone.

                         
          He looks at her.

                          BATMAN
           There's more to you than that.
          She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to keep letting you down.
          He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.
           Come with me. Save yourself. You
           don't owe these people anymore -
           you've given them everything...

                          BATMAN
           Not everything. Not yet.

                         
          Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the
          bike and takes off.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT


                         
          Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the
          tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN


                         
          The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the
          op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the
          building, forming up into an opposing line.
          A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.
          The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -
          until two Tumblers arrive.

                          VOICE

                          (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

           DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED

           UPON.
          The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.

           144.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           There's only one police in this
           city.
          He steps forward. The line follows.

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.

                         

                          BANE
           Open fire.

                         

          EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into
          the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter -
          WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and
          BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES
          and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until
          they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is
          filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel
          blockage...the dust settles. Her path is clear.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon heard the fighting. Checks the box. Nervous.

                         

                          GORDON

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and
          right. A space clears - he is face the face with the
          Batman...

                         

                          BANE
           You came back. To die with your
           city.

                          BATMAN
           No. I came back to stop you.

           145.

                         

                         
          Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head.
          Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side.
          Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in
          a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck
          smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in,
          blasting at the Guards. Gordon opens the back - empty. No
          bomb. Wrong truck.

                          GORDON
           That's impossible... Come on! Cut
           over to Fifth!

                         
          They sprint for the next parallel avenue...

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Fox hurries into the reactor - starts throwing switches...

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - CONTINUOUS

          Blake leads the boys out of the home - points down the
          street.

                          BLAKE
           Knock on doors, spread the word -
           the bomb's going to blow! Get out
           by the South Street tunnel, or over
           the bridge! Do two blocks, then get
           back to the bus!
          The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the
          bus.

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler
          roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.

           146.

                         

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane SMASHES backwards through the door, Batman on him.
          Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries
          guarding Miranda move towards them -

                         

                          BANE
           Stay back. He is mine -
          Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but
          Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the
          tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane
          bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a
          hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.

                          BATMAN
           Give me the trigger! You'd never
           give it to an ordinary citizen -
          Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through
          pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for
          relief.

                         

                          BANE
           I broke you. How have you come
           back?

                          BATMAN
           You thought you were the only one
           who could learn the strength to
           escape?
          Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.

                         

                          BANE
           I never escaped - R¯'s al Gh¯l

          Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street.
          His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the

          the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on...

          Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the

                          MIRANDA/TALIA
           My mother named me Talia before she

           Goodbye.
          Then is overrun.

           He saw only a monster who could
           never be tamed. Whose very
           existence was a reminder of the
           hell he'd left his wife to die in.
           He excommunicated Bane from the
           League of Shadows. His only crime
           was that he loved me. I could not
           truly forgive my father...
          Talia looks at Batman, cold.
           Until you murdered him.

          She hits the button - nothing.

                         

                         

          EXT. FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS

          A light on the metal box is blinking. Gordon hangs on -

                         

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Talia turns, furious.

                          BATMAN
           Your knife may have been too
           slow...
          A Mercenary steps forward -

                          MERCENARY
           The truck's under attack -
          Talia looks around, mind racing.

                          TALIA
           Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a
           way to block my signal. No matter -
           (Looks at watch.) He's bought
           Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at
           Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We
           must secure the bomb until it
           detonates.
          Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a
          Mercenary - points it at Batman.

                          TALIA
           Not yet... I want him to feel the
           heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of
           twelve million souls you failed.
          Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes,
          tenderly.
           Goodbye, my friend.
          Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the
          Mercenaries.

           150.

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers
          pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars,
          cops.

                         
          Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia's
          Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way.

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the
          rounds in the barrels.

                          BANE
           You'll have to imagine the fire -

                         
          He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face.
           We both know I need to kill you
           now.
          He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the
          lobby by cannon fire.
          Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.

                          CATWOMAN
           The whole no-guns thing? I don't
           feel as strongly about it as you
           do.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off,
          marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A
          Uniform shouts through the loudhailer -

                          UNIFORM
           Stay there! What are you doing?!

                          BLAKE

                          (PULLS BADGE)
           Blake, MCU - I'm getting these boys
           to safety -

                         

                          UNIFORM
           Safety?! You're gonna get us all
           killed. Anyone crosses this bridge
           they blow the city -

           151.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           It's gonna blow anyway. We need
           this bridge open right now.

                          UNIFORM
           No one leaves the island. Orders -

                          BLAKE
           Whose orders? Bane's?

                          UNIFORM
           Police Department's.

                          BLAKE
           Haven't you heard the shooting? The
           Batman's battling it out with Bane

                          -

                         

                          UNIFORM
           The Batman's dead. Look, Officer -

                          BLAKE
           It's Detective -

                         

                          UNIFORM
           Well, Detective, you take one more
           step, we have to shoot you. Two
           more steps, we have to blow the
           bridge.

                         

                          BLAKE
           (to the boys)
           Wait for me back at the bus.
          The Boys walk back down the bridge...

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Talia's convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each
          flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down...

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Batman looks at Catwoman.

                         

                          BATMAN
           I need you on the ground, me in the
           air, we have to force that convoy
           east, to the entrance to the

                          REACTOR -

           152.

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Catwoman roars down the steps on the Bat-Pod.

                         

          INT. BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon climbs into the back of the truck - the bomb is
          there, heating up. He looks at the countdown - nine
          minutes...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake turns back to the Uniform.

                          BLAKE
           Your orders are out of date! The
           situation's changed! Listen, I'm a
           cop like you. And I'm walking out
           there. Please don't shoot me.
          Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the
          ground. A rolling battle ensues. Catwoman targets the rear
          of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the
          junctions, trying to force the convoy east...
          The Tumbler's gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman. She
          swerves to avoid heavy fire.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots.

                          UNIFORM
           Son-of-a-bitch! (To his partner.)
           Blow it! Before he reaches the line

                          -
          His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake -

                         

                          UNIFORM
           Get down! We're blowing the bridge!
          As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him
          blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.

           153.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge
          crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the
          air. Catwoman dodges around it, uses the Bat-Pod cannons to
          take out another Tumbler... The countdown ticks away...seven
          minutes.

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          As Fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye -
          something is wrong...

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap.

                          BLAKE
           You idiots! You sons of bitches!
           You're killing us!!

                         

                         

          INT. BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately
          strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers. He dives back inside,
          moves to the front of the trailer - looks at the bulkhead,
          gauging the driver's position. Starts firing blind through
          the bulkhead -

                         

          INT. CAB, BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bullets fly through the cab. The driver takes one, falls
          forward, dead. Talia takes the wheel - bullets keep coming.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Blake races back. Father Reilly has the boys in a huddle,

                         PRAYING -

                          BLAKE
           Father! Get the boys on the bus -

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           But there's nowhere to go, son.

           154.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          The Bat spins down in front of the black truck, forcing it
          into a hard right turn...

                         

                         

          INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Talia watches the navigation screen.

                          TALIA
           Pushing us to the entrance of the

           reconnect the core.

                          (OVER RADIO)
           Can they?

                         
          Talia smiles.

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Fox runs to a ladder. Alarms sound. As he hits the ladder he
          turns. A massive rumble builds - water SMASHES into the
          reactor, flooding in from both directions.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler. She blasts it
          again and again - it flips diagonally into the path of the
          black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side. Both
          vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel.

                         

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

          Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as
          a wave smashes into him, painfully...

           155.

                         

                         

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to
          expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod.

                          GORDON
           Give me a hand!
          The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try
          and grab the core but it is too hot.
           Let's get a cable on it and drag it
           out! Come on, we're almost there -
          Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
          Dying.

                          TALIA
           Fox showed me how to operate the
           reactor core. Including the

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.

                          TALIA
           There is no way to stop this bomb.
           Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at
           Batman.) My father's work is done.

                         
          Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -
          Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to
          attach a hoist from the Bat.

                          GORDON
           What're you doing?

                          BATMAN
           Two minutes. I can fly it out over
           the bay...

                         
          Catwoman is at his side as he works.

                          CATWOMAN
           Rig it out to fly over the water,
           then bail -

           No autopilot.
          She takes this in. He stands to face her.

                          CATWOMAN
           You could've gone anywhere. Been
           anything. But you came back here.

                          BATMAN
           So did you.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           I guess we're both suckers.
          She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
          to the Bat, Gordon alongside.

                         

                          GORDON
           So this is the part where you
           vanish, only this time you don't
           come back?

                         
          Batman opens the canopy.

          Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus.

                          BLAKE
           You think they need to hear that in
           their last seconds? You think I'm

           I never cared who you were -

                         

                          BATMAN
           And you were right.

                          GORDON
           But shouldn't the people know the
           hero who saved them?

                          BATMAN
           A hero can be anyone. That was
           always the point.

                         
          Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
           Anyone. A man doing something as
           simple and reassuring as putting a
           coat around a little boy's
           shoulders to let him know that the
           world hadn't ended...
          The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers

                         -
          INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
          around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
          loving.
          Gordon looks up to the cockpit -

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne?
          - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
          out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
          tunnel mouth.

                         
          The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
          building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
          there's no power to get over it.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake shouts into the bus -

                          BLAKE
           Heads down! Heads down, now!

           158.

                         

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Blake, they need to make their
           peace.
          Blake turns to him, furious.

                         

                          BLAKE
           They're children! They have no
           peace to make -
          An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
          startled, turns to the children on the bus.
           Get down! This is it!
          The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
          Blake.

                         

                          LITTLE BOY
           No. That's Batman!
          Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
          Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
          dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
          of the river...the bay...the ocean...
          Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
          - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
          over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...

                         
          As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
          inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
          boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see a beautiful city and a
           brilliant people rising from this
           abyss...'
          Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see the lives for which I lay
           down my life, peaceful, useful,
           prosperous and happy...'

                         

                         

          EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is
          Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is
          there, whose face we do not yet see...

           159.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           'I see that I hold a sanctuary in
           their hearts, and in the hearts of
           their descendants, generations
           hence. It is a far, far better
           thing that I do, than I have ever
           done...'
          Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
           'It is a far, far better rest that
           I go to than I have ever known.'

                         
          Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
          Alfred. Tears streaming.
          Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
          Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
          family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
          Thomas and Martha Wayne.

                          ALFRED
           I'm so sorry. I failed you. You
           trusted me, and I failed you.
          And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.

                         

          EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side.

                          GORDON
           Can I change your mind about
           quitting the force?

                         

                          BLAKE
           No. What you said about structures.
           About shackles. I can't take it.
           The injustice. (Gestures at
           gardens.) I mean...no one's ever
           going to know who saved an entire
           city.

                          GORDON
           They know. (Off look.) It was
           Batman.

           160.

                         

                         

          EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY

          Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue
          being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in
          granite. We move in on the stone face...

                         

           VOICE (V.O.)
           Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to
           reflect his more modest estate...

                         

                         

          INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

          The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small
          group.

                          LAWYER
           Nonetheless, there are considerable
           assets to dispose of... The
           contents of the house are to be

                          SOLD -
          He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake.

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Movers carefully bring artworks and furniture out of the

           LAWYER (V.O.)
           - to settle the estate's accounts.
           The remainder is left in its
           entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...

          Blake shifts. Out of place. The Lawyer continues.

                          LAWYER
           The house and grounds are left to
           the city of Gotham, on condition
           that they never be demolished,

          Different movers carry bunk beds into the huge house.

           LAWYER (V.O.)
           And that they shall be used for one
           purpose, and one purpose only...
          A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children
          towards the house. The children look up at the house,
          wide-eyed.
           The housing and care of the city's
           at-risk and orphaned children.
          A sign reads:

           My clerk will help anyone with the
           smaller correspondences and
           instructions...
          Blake approaches the Clerk. She smiles.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, John.

                          CLERK

                          (CHECKS LIST)
           Nothing here.
          Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.

                          BLAKE
           Try my legal name.

                         
          The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.

                          CLERK
           Yup, here it is.

                         
          She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various
          items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.

                          CLERK
           You should use your full name. I
           like that name... Robin.

           162.

                         
          Blake smiles, embarrassed. Leaves.

                          LAWYER
           Any word on the missing item?

                          CLERK
           No, not yet.

                          LAWYER
           Well, they'd better leave no stone
           unturned... We can't just put a
           string of pearls on the manifest as
           'lost'.

          Fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor. Two
          Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit.

                          TECH 1
           Why worry about the stabilization
           software? This whole autopilot
           system's obsolete -

                          FOX
           Please, I just need to know what I
           could've done to fix it.

                          TECH 2
           But Mr. Fox, it's already been
           fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software
           patch...six months ago.

                          FOX

                          (CONFUSED)
           Check the user ident on the
           patch...

                         
          Tech 2 types some more keys. Looks surprised.

                          TECH 2
           Huh. Bruce Wayne.

                         
          Fox turns away from the rotor, an idea starting to form...

                         

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Blake sits in his car looking at a GPS device, puzzled.
          Beside him, the sports bag, open. In it is a piece of paper
          with coordinates, on top of some climbing rope and shackles.
          Blake gets out of the car with the bag. Follows the GPS into
          the trees.

          Blake finds a large waterfall... He checks his GPS,

          brunette in pearls. Selina. Alfred pays his bill, content.
