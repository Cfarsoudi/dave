15 Minutes

 
	FADE IN

	on the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words
	on the side of the plane.

	INT. AIRPLANE

	ANGLE DOWN

	on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
	Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
	the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
	pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
	to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
	The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
	him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
	small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport
	is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in
	CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

				EMIL (V.O.)
		Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I
		say.  Don't open your mouth.

				OLEG (V.O.)
		Okay.

	INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

	CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are
	split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
	visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An
	unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. 
	Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His
	eyes are alert, cunning and smart.

	OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not
	tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. 
	(The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)

				EMIL
		Don't fool around.

				OLEG
		Okay.

	Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
	take a picture of himself.

				EMIL
		Did you hear what I said?

				OLEG
		I want to document my trip to America.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Next.
			(Emil steps up)
		Could I see your documents, please?

				EMIL
		Yes sir.

	He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
	image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What is your intended purpose of your
		visit to the United States?

				EMIL
		Two weeks holiday.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		How much money are you carrying with
		you?

				EMIL
		I have five-hundred dollars.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the
		FIS area!

	Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
	Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
			(to Emil)
		Is he with you?  Are you travelling
		together?

				EMIL
		Yes.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Please join us.
			(to Oleg)
		Come on forward.

				EMIL
		Is there a problem?

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		No, you're travelling together.  I want
		to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
		you?  Can I take a look at your
		documents?
			(takes Oleg's passport)
		Are you related?

				OLEG
		Yes...he's my friend.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Okay.  You're a Czech national and
		you're a Russian national.  How do you
		know one another?

	Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.

				EMIL
		We are both from Prague.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		How long are you planning to stay?

				EMIL
		Two weeks.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

				EMIL
		He doesn't speak English.

				OLEG
		I speak English.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		Then answer my questions.  Where were
		you planning to stay during the two
		weeks that you're here?

				OLEG
		New York.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Yes, we're in New York now.  But where
		are you planning to stay in New York?

				OLEG
		A cheap hotel.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What are you coming here to do?

				OLEG
		I'm here for movies.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Movies...to be in the movies or to see
		movies?

				OLEG
		Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I
		see movie at school called "It's a
		Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. 
		Ever since I want to come to America. 
		Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A
		land where anyone can be anything. As
		long as they are white.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Excuse me?

				EMIL
		He made joke, bad joke.  First time on
		airplane...

	The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Well, they've got valid visas, but they
		don't have much money.  Uh... and I'm
		not...uh, I think there's a possibility
		they may be coming to live and reside.

				SUPERVISOR
		Look how long the line is.  We gotta
		move 'em out.  I'll take them down to
		secondary.

	Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
	bar.  EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
	his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. 
	Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.  Not only
	is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
	he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
	the subject of several magazine articles.  There's even been
	a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.  Leon has been
	with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.

	Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
	reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story."  Hawkins is also
	the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
	Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

	Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. 
	Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war
	story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.

				EDDIE
		So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
		we got Emergency Service with the heavy
		weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I
		say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
		go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the
		sudden I turn around and a kid with a
		shotgun let one go.  Right where I was
		standin'.  That coulda been it.  I
		coulda had my head blown off and for
		what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,
		takes the safety off and it's over.  If
		I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
		a bad habit - I would've had my head
		blown off.

				HAWKINS
		Jesus Christ.

	PAULIE, the owner, walks up.

				PAULIE
		Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?

				HAWKINS
		Another martini.

				LEON
		Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

				EDDIE
		Vodka tonic.

				LEON
			(rethinks it)
		Maybe you could just put in a shot of
		Martell?

	Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
	vodka.

				LEON (CONT'D)
			(of Eddie's story)
		It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid
		kid.

				EDDIE
		What's the kid gonna say - sorry? 
		Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. 
		Like last week - we were at the morgue
		and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
		here - liver there - his heart in a pan. 
		Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
		dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who
		knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3
		or some shit and shot him and now you
		can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
		human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. 
		Sooner or later.  That's me.  

				HAWKINS
		Sooner or later that's everybody.  

				EDDIE
		Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like
		that.  I mean, what do I got left? 
		Coupla articles.  A medal or two. 
		Plaque here and there and in a coupla
		years no one remembers me anymore.

				HAWKINS
		I think you're getting a little moody
		there, Eddie.

				EDDIE
		I'm not moody.

	Hawkins and Leon share a look.

				HAWKINS
		Isn't he a little moody?

				LEON
		Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in
		love.

				HAWKINS
		In love?  With who?

	Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. 
	Takes a seat next to Eddie.  Eddie asks Hawkins.

				EDDIE
		How old are your kids?

				HAWKINS
		My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. 
		Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're
		thinking about having a kid!  How old
		are you?  Never mind. 
		Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
		cliche you hear about kids - they change
		your life, they make you a better
		person, they make you whole...
			(beat)
		It's all true!  Before I had kids when
		friends talked about their kids, I
		wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I
		right, Leon?

				LEON
		Absomotherfuckin'lutely.  You can have
		all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody
		so much as looks sideways at my four
		girls -- I'd kill 'em.  
			(takes out his wallet)
		You haven't seen my youngest have you?

	As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Yeah?

				HAWKINS
		Paulie, you've got kids, right?

				PAULIE
		My kids don't talk to me anymore but
		they were great when they were young.

				LEON
			(into the phone)
		Sure it's him?  Great!
			(collapses the phone)
		Unique's home.

	They all rise from the table.

				EDDIE
		Paulie, I need the cure.

				PAULIE
		Step into my office.

	Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.

				HAWKINS
		So you got your kids listening to Opera? 
		You still singing in the church on the
		weekends?

	INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

	Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've
	been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I
		understand that.
			(to Emil)
		And what kind of work do you do?

				EMIL
		I am butcher.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		You're a butcher?  What do you use pig
		intestines for?

				EMIL
		You stuff sausage in it.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		And what do you do with the bones?

				EMIL
		Dog food.

	Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
	Control for their detainment.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Are you married?

				EMIL
		No.  Are you proposing?

	ANGLE UP

	through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us...

	INT. MENS ROOM

	Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
	full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
	eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.

				EDDIE
		Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? 
		What are you doin' Saturday?

	Leon enters.  Eddie turns.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I'm gonna propose.

				LEON
		When?

				EDDIE
		Tomorrow.  At lunch.

				LEON
		You ready?

	Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns.

				EDDIE
		The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

	Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
	action.  Each stands with an old suitcase.

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the
		movies!

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Don't speak Russian!

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Why?  Why do I always have to speak to
		you in Czech?

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Because I don't like your ugly language. 
		I heard enough of it in school!  Now
		speak Czech or English.  And don't fool
		around anymore.  You almost got us
		thrown out!

	Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This
	is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring
	inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A
	videocamera's pointed out in the street.

				OLEG
		Look.  New videocameras.  Color
		viewfinder.  Image stabilization. 
		Solarization.  Night vision.

				EMIL
		We have no money.  Come on.

	Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. 
	Emil slides into the cab.

				CABBIE
		Where you wanna go, buddy?

	Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the
	return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
	Cabbie.

				EMIL
		Here.

	Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg
	hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
	coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut 
	and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling
	out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Go!

	Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
		

	EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY

	Eddie's car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.

				HAWKINS
		So what's unique?

				EDDIE
		Not what.  Who.

	Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
	covered in blood.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was
		taking too long to put her make-up on. 
		they were late for a party.  Stabbed her
		with a beer bottle.

				HAWKINS
		That's unique.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

	Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.

				LOOKOUT
		Top floor.  Back room.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the
		news and I look good.  But the problem
		with becoming a star is downtown.  They
		shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

	As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. 
	Waves them off.  They hurry away.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees
		are killing me.  Stay behind me.

				HAWKINS
		You're worried for my safety.  I'm
		touched.

	Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
	the fire escape.

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		Ready?

				EDDIE
		Keep them out of my way.

				HAWKINS
		Okay.  You ready?

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

	Eddie closes in.

				HAWKINS
			(into his cell phone)
		COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,
		LET'S MOVE IT!

	Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
	the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
	the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where
	he lands dropping his gun.

	Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.

				EDDIE
		What's your rush?  Going to a party?

				UNIQUE
		Why you chasin' me, man?

				EDDIE
		I don't know.  You always come outta
		your house that way?

				UNIQUE
		It's not my house, man.  I don't live
		here.

				EDDIE
		Well, sounds like burglary to me.

	Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.

				UNIQUE
		I know you man.

	An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a
	mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.

				HAWKINS
			(to Eddie)
		Any chance we can do that again?

				EDDIE
		Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first
		time.
						

	EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY

	The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg
	gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
	into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks
	back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.

				EMIL
		Turn that off!  Get the bags.

				OLEG
		Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a
		dog.

				EMIL
		For five years I paid for your
		stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
		rest of my life if I say so.
			(challenging)
		Unless you refuse, Oleg.

	Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
	he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the
	occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		There.  5RW.

	Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks
	and Emil pushes it open.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY

	The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
	stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack
	pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl.

				OLEG
		What?

				EMIL
		Smell like chemicals...for smoking
		drugs.

	Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
	down the dirty hallway to a corner door.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS -
	a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. 
	He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg
	films him...

				MILOS
		Emil???!

				EMIL
		Surprise!  Surprise!

	Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
	comely wife.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears
	plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina
	has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
	apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
	bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with
	kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is
	a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The
	following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)

				EMIL
		Your sister said she didn't know where
		you were so you shouldn't write to her
		with return address if you're hiding. 

				MILOS
		Did you hurt her?

				EMIL
		You know me...I never hurt anybody. 
		Where's the money?

				OLEG
		Hello, Tamina.

	Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks
	at Oleg.

				MILOS
		Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
			(to Emil)
		Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were
		caught.
			(of Oleg)
		It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank
		clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going
		to wait!!!

				EMIL
		Milos.  Get my money!

	Oleg videotapes the scene.

	CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR

	All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
	obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
	around her.

				MILOS
			(nervously)
		We spent it!

				EMIL
		Ha. Ha.

				MILOS
		Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. 
		You think I'd be working if I had
		money?!

	Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
	KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
	throat.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		Emil.  Put down the knife.

	Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		Emil.  I'll help you.

	Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
	him by talking softly.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		I can get you a job.

				EMIL
		A job?

				MILOS
		Yes, the money is good.

				EMIL
		As a plumber?!

				MILOS
		It's easy to learn.

				EMIL
		A job??  As a plumber???  You think I
		come to America to work!

				MILOS
		We started over, you can too.

				EMIL
			(furious)
		You spent all the money while I was in
		prison?  Now you tell me to get a job
		fixing toilets?!?

	Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
	it toward Milos' chest!

	Oleg videotapes it.  Then lowers the camera - shocked that
	Emil killed Milos.

	Blood sprays Tamina's face.  She tries to run but Oleg grabs
	her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
	floor.  He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
	Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!

	THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR

	flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. 
	Emil kicks the bedroom door open.  Sees the window leading to
	the fire escape.  He dashes to it.  Sees four flights down -
	the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.  Barefoot.  Her hair still
	wet.  

	She looks up.  She is beautiful and terrified.  She runs
	down the alley.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		She saw!

	Emil hurries toward the bathroom.  She just got out of the
	shower.  Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. 
	Emil grabs the purse.  Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.  He
	opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Daphne Hanlova.

	There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
	arrived - June 16, 1998.  Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
	STAY.  Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
	blank pages.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Six month visa.  Still here two years
		later.  They'll deport her if she goes
		to Police.

	Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
	shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
	floor.  He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
	and bottles aside.

				OLEG
		What are you looking for?

	Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.

				EMIL
		I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.

	Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
	darkness.
		
		EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

	A face comes from the darkness.  It's an athletically
	handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.  He's in a
	tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. 
	He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.  A sensitive man of rugged
	honesty.  He runs down the hill in a hurry.  A MUGGER steps
	in his path.

				MUGGER
		Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare
		twenty?

				JORDY
		Look, I don't have time for you, get out
		of my way!!

				MUGGER
		Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
		money?

	The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
	grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
	manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
	behind his back.  With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
	BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
	the mugger's head.  Jordy displays his shield.

				JORDY
		Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you
		happy?

				MUGGER
		Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry
		guns.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah?  Guess again.

	Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
	pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
	credit cards.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Nice - how many people you ripped off
		tonight?!  Get up!

	As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You couldn't listen to me, could you?

	Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.  Cuffs him so his face is
	pressed up against the bark.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I'll send a cop back for you.

				MUGGER
		Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like
		this.  Some freak'll come by and stab
		me!

	Jordy jogs off across the park.

				MUGGER (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Come back!!

	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.  Radios CRACKLE.  There's
	a crowd growing.  Jordy pushes his way through.  The top
	floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
	reduced to smoking ruins.  The trees are covered in debris
	and soot.  Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.

				LOUIE
		Lieutenant - take up your line and
		relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
		floor.

				JORDY
		Hey, Louie, were you first due?

				LOUIE
		Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
		'cause you got two roasts on the top
		floor but you don't hafta investigate
		cause homicide is up there.

				JORDY
		Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't
		make it a crime scene yet.

				LOUIE
		Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.

				KORFIN (O.S.)
		Yo, Jordy!

	BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
	with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
	turnout coat.

				KORFIN (CONT'D)
		Where you been, man?  We got a
		celebrity!

				JORDY
		I heard.  Who the hell let them up
		there?

				KORFIN
		I don't know, you think Eddie will give
		me his autograph?

				JORDY
		You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody
		suspicious?

				KORFIN
		Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah, why?

				KORFIN
		'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
		now!

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,
	smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by
	what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
	charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
	listening to Leon.

				LEON
		So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
		position - that they were doin' each
		other but were so whacked out of their
		heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
		lit it up, and they got fried.  What do
		you think, Eddie?

	Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.

				EDDIE
		I don't know.  We got the experts here. 
		Show them what you found - I hope you
		don't mind, we came over to see if we
		could help.

	Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
	celebrity.

				KORFIN
		Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -
		Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
		you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

				JORDY
		Could you put out the cigar?  Part of
		the job is picking up scents.

				EDDIE
		Oh, sure.

	Eddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar
	holder and pockets it to finish later.

				LEON
		Well, I found - check it out - crack
		pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

	Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin
	shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

				KORFIN
		Sorry, bro.

				JORDY
		Hey, that's great you guys got it all
		wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
		through the routine?  It gives us
		somethin' to do.

				EDDIE
		No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

				LEON
		No.  Go ahead.

				JORDY
		Thanks.  Appreciate it.

	Jordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no
	respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie
	rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
	living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
	charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.

				KORFIN
		Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
		good patterns - about thirty minutes
		old.

	Jordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white
	rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The
	glove comes out white.

				JORDY
		Mouth's clean, too.

				KORFIN
		Clean?

				JORDY
		Don't blow your nose!

	Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
		burn 'em out.  Let it run.

				KORFIN
		But you knew that, right?

	Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy
	turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other
	room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.

				JORDY
		So the way you see it, two crack heads
		burned themselves up?

				LEON
		That's what it looks like to me.

				JORDY
		And while they're burning up, they're
		still goin' down on each other?  You got
		to hand it to them.

				LEON
			(realizes he's wrong - blows it
			 off)
		Yeah, well, some people got their
		priorities straight.

	Leon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
	pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
	heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth
	inside.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		What was that?

				JORDY
		Evidence.  Of a homicide.

	That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You know what that is, right?

				EDDIE
		No, what is it?

				JORDY
		Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
			(to a fireman joking a wall)
		Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole
		in the floor?

				CAMELLO
		No problem.
			(to Eddie and Leon)
		Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna
		back up a little more.  Don't wanna get
		your pants wet.

	Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
	set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello
	hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
	bodies and Korfin explains:

				KORFIN
		They have not soot in their mouths,
		which means they weren't breathin'
		before the fire and that usually means
		they were deceased - and this piece of
		cloth that my partner found means they
		were wrapped up in something, probably
		doused with a flammable liquid and
		positioned like this on the bed.  To the
		untrained eye, it looks like an
		accident.

	Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
	something.

				LEON
		What's he looking for?

				EDDIE
		A timer.

	Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
	on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from
	Jordy and moves to Eddie.

				KORFIN
		Here you go.  A big double homicide.

	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
	arriving.  Jumps out. 
	Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.  They open the
	trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.

				KORFIN
		You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
		timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

				JORDY
		He knew all along.

				KORFIN
		What??

				JORDY
		That's why he was so quiet.  He was
		testing us.

	Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
	inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
	microphone at Eddie.  She's smart, aggressive and respected
	by her peers.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective, does it look like a murder?

				EDDIE
		We don't know that yet.  It's much too
		early.  There's a lot to be done.

				NICOLETTE
		How many victims are up there?

				EDDIE
		There are two bodies found at this
		point.

				NICOLETTE
		Can we go up to the crime scene?

				EDDIE
		You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

				NICOLETTE
		Is it drug related?

				EDDIE
		We don't know.  When I have more I'll
		let you know.

	Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
	Eddie's hand.  She barrels on...

				NICOLETTE
		Detective...what's that you're holding
		in your hand?  Evidence?

	Mike pans up to Eddie's face.  Other reporters arrive,
	hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash
	as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in
	the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
	HANDLOVA.  She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress. 
	She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a
	glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the
	crowd - but Daphne is gone.

				KORFIN
		What?

				JORDY
		There was a woman - I think she wanted
		to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
		shit!  Oh no!

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER

	Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. 
	Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
	now NAKED!

				MUGGER
		You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped
		me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me
		all over, it was disgusting.

	Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.

				JORDY
		I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

	Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You okay?

				MUGGER
		A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you
		for this!  You violated my civil rights!

				JORDY
		Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob
		me!  I could arrest you right now! 
		You're lucky you're walking away from
		this.  Now get outta here.

	Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around
	himself cursing - hurrying away.
		

	EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT

	Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
	sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
	the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
	trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down
	twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he
	angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. 
	He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
	behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has
	been talking to a FATHER.

				ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
		So you slept with your son's wife! 
		What's that all about?

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		I take full responsibility for sleepin'
		with my daughter in law.  I had low self
		esteem, I thought I had to compete with
		him.

	Emil reaches for his dictionary.

				EMIL
			(mutters)
		Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

	He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
	esteem.

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		Losin' my job and everything, caused my
		behavioral disorder.
			(turns to his son)
		Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

	The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates...

	Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
	in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
	rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time -
	as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
	between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's
	wearing Milos' Rolex. 
	Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
	earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil
	looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Turn that fucking thing off!

				OLEG
			(Czech)
		I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos
		die.  It's just like a move but realer.

	Emil grabs the videocamera.
			(Czech)
		Don't break it!  Don't break it!

				EMIL
		Speak English!

				OLEG
			(English)
		You said speak Czech!

				EMIL
		How you erase this?

				OLEG
		I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

	Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
	bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the
	camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. 
	Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.

				EMIL
		Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill
		him.
			(noticing)
		What's this?

	Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a
	picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
	ESCORTS - and a number.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Worldly escorts?

	Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
	finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the
	number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the
	background.

				SEXY VOICE
		Hi?

				EMIL
		Hello?

				SEXY VOICE
		Are you looking for companionship?

	Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.

				OLEG
		Whore?

				EMIL
		I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European
		girl?  A Czech girl?

				SEXY VOICE
		Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
		girl.

				EMIL
		I take her.  Send her!

	EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

	Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
	returning.

				JORDY
		Now that you know him, maybe you can get
		extra work in the next movie they make
		about him.

				KORFIN
		Yeah?

				JORDY
		Maybe you can be his stand-in.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

	The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
	the high of fighting a fire.  Korfin and Jordy walk toward
	the TV room.  The TV is on in the background.  We can see
	Nicolette interviewing Eddie.  He holds up the paint can.

				CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
		What the hell is that??  You gave Eddie
		Flemming the evidence?!

	They turn.  DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
	of the arson squad - comes over.  Duffy's tough, Irish and
	very political.

				DUFFY
			(pointing to the TV)
		Who did cause and origin?

				JORDY
		Who do you think, Chief?!

				DUFFY
		Then why didn't you talk to the
		reporter?

				JORDY
		'Cause we got more important things to
		do, like finding out who did it.

	They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.

				DUFFY
		Don't you guys understand?  It's all
		about image.  The better we look the
		more money I get to pay you guys
		overtime.

				KORFIN
		Yeah, right.

				DUFFY
		What was that, Korfin?

				KORFIN
		I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As
		soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
		alert the media.

				DUFFY
		You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve
		this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

	They all head upstairs.

	INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter.  There are posters of
	pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls.  GARCIA - a
	Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.

				GARCIA
		Hey guys, I got your torch.  He just
		gave a full confession.

	A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
	turns.  He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly
	scratched cross etched in his forehead.  He craves attention.

				MAX
		It's my fire!  Screw homicide.  I'll
		tell you guys everything!

	Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin.  They sit across from
	each other.  Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
	bothering to stop.

				JORDY
		What's that on your forehead, Max? 
		That's a nice attention getter.

				MAX
		Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist
		like you!  Now, are you guys gonna
		arrest me, or not?

				JORDY
		How did you start the fire this time?

				MAX
		I used an accelerant.

				JORDY
		Yeah?  What kind?

				MAX
			(to Jordy)
		Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about
		your wife leavin' you.

				KORFIN
		Max.

				MAX
			(continuing)
		...Yeah, and with your old man dying
		last year you - what's it?  Just you and
		the dog now?

				KORFIN
		Max!  

				MAX
		Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
		your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a
		big shot downtown.

	Jordy pops out of his seat.

				JORDY
		That's it!  You're outta here.

	Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.

				MAX
		That's it.  I'm suing.

				KORFIN
		Get in line.

	Korfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia
	who is laughing.

				JORDY
		What's so funny.  How does he know so
		much about me?  Who tells him my life
		story?

				GARCIA
		He hangs around downstairs.  The guys
		talk to him.  He's a joke...

				JORDY
		He's no joke!  One day he's gonna
		graduate from trash can fires and do
		something big.

				GARCIA
		Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the
		station.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT

	As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen,
	accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
	America's highest rated 'news magazine' show.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and
		this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you
		an exclusive interview with Stephen
		Geller - who horrified the nation two
		years ago when he went berserk and
		murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
		shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's
		claim, spoken softly and articulately,
		is that he is the victim.  According to
		Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
		day were not his fault but were the
		fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to
		believe...watch.

				EMIL (O.S.)
		Louder.

	VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
	on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Louder.

	Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
	volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
	interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's
	sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
	stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
	background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird
	dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the
	paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.

				STEPHEN GELLER
		This had nothing to do with shoes that
		didn't fit or my relationship with my
		father who, as you know, made a fortune
		selling penny loafers in the fifties. 
		These people died because of the
		criminal actions of my doctor.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Your doctor?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that
		I stay on my medication.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		...so you feel absolutely no
		responsibility for killing these people?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		It was my finger that pulled the
		trigger, but I'm not morally
		responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what
		I was capable of.  How could I know. 
		I'm not a doctor.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		You seem very savvy for a man who's been
		found mentally incompetent to stand
		trial.

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a
		year away from getting my masters in
		Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life
		has been permanently disrupted.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you
		selling paintings now for quite a lot of
		money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you
		call it, jump started your career as an
		artist?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Look, I'm in here.  You call this a
		career move?

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		And isn't there a movie in the works
		about you?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		We're in negotiations, that's correct.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent
		criminals from profiting from their
		crimes?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		That doesn't apply to me because I'm not
		a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I
		wasn't convicted.

	Emil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.

				EMIL
		I love America.  No one is responsible
		for what they do.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
	to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Get in the bathroom!

				OLEG (O.S.)
		Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

				EMIL
		Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
		shut up!

	Emil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom,
	closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks
	down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
	sticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants
	cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
	and opens it.  It's not Daphne and she's not world class.

				HONEY
		Hi, I'm Honey.

				EMIL
		Where's Czech girl?

				HONEY
		Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. 
		I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm
		a Czech girl.

	She enters.  Closes the door behind her.

				HONEY (CONT'D)
		Now I like to get business out of the
		way before we get down to pleasure.  Why
		don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

				EMIL
		I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you
		know her?

	Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey.  During the rest of
	the scene Oleg films her.  Honey begins to undress.

				HONEY
		It's an outcall service run out of an
		apartment.  I don't meet the other
		girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

				EMIL
		Where is escort service?

				HONEY
		That's confidential.  Could you put the
		money on the dresser?

				EMIL
		I like to talk to the person who runs
		the service.  Can you give me address?

				HONEY
		Look.  Do we have a problem here? 
		There's no reason to have a problem. 
		I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You
		wanna Czech girl? 
		After I'm done with you, you won't miss
		her.  Now why don't you pay me?

	She starts to unfasten Emil's belt.

				EMIL
			(stopping her)
		Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just
		give me the address and then you go.

				HONEY
			(suddenly hard as nails)
		Look, man, I don't give a shit if you
		want sex or not, but you're payin' for
		my time.

	Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
	the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
	furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.

				EMIL
		Give me the address!!

				HONEY
		Alright, alright - don't hurt me! 
		Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

	Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
	with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil's face!

	Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame.  He
	WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
	the door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut!  Emil turns blindly,
	rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.  Honey darts
	toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
	Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.  Horrified, she turns around as
	Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
	tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
	her!  Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.  Oleg
	films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...

	THE KITCHEN KNIFE

	As Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. 
	Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around
	her face.  Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN
	INTO:
		
		INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	DAPHNE, a sketch of her face.

				JORDY (O.S.)
		Her lips are fuller than that.  You can
		see 'em a mile away.

	WIDER

	Food containers are scattered all over the place.  The female
	COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy.  Stacks of failed sketches
	sit beside her.

				COMPOSITE ARTIST
		What about her cheek bones?

				JORDY
		Her cheek bones are prominent and her
		eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when
		I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she
		was looking to get away.  But she was
		absolutely beautiful.

	The composite artist looks at Jordy.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I gotta good look at her.

	Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is
	watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the
	landlord of the 7th Street brownstone.  Garcia is also on the
	phone.  The other investigators are gone.  Working late into
	the night.  Everybody's exhausted.  It's almost dawn.

				KORFIN
		-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long
		have they been livin' in your building?  
			(writes 4 YEARS on his pad)
		Alright, I'll be in touch when we know
		somethin'.
			(to Jordy)
		Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were
		quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord
		don't know who your girl is.

				JORDY
		How long they been livin' here?

				KORFIN
		You hear that question, Garcia?

				GARCIA
		Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
		they've been here illegally.

				KORFIN
		Well, they're definitely permanent
		residents now.

				GARCIA
		I got the owner of the plumbing company
		Milos worked for.

				KORFIN
		Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go
		see him in the morning.

				JORDY
		You go home.  I'm takin' your car and
		goin' back to the crime scene.

				KORFIN
		Aren't you tired?

				JORDY
		If I go home I won't be able to fall
		asleep anyway.

	Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness
	and heads for the door.  Korfin falls in behind him.  As they
	pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.

				KORFIN
			(of the picture)
		She keepin' you up?  Like to meet her,
		huh?  She'd make you forget your ex
		wife.  Cure your insomnia.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN

	CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
	what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment.  The roof has
	been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
	through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.

				EDDIE
		Okay to smoke?

	Jordy turns, surprised.  Eddie sits on a singed chair.  He
	pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton
	soup' container, smoking a cigar.  On the arm of the armchair
	is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
	crime scene and the burned bodies.

				JORDY
		It's your crime scene now.  You can do
		what you want.

				EDDIE
		Watch the news?

				JORDY
		Nah, I musta missed it.

				EDDIE
		Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys
		the credit.

				JORDY
		Well, just so you know, I don't care
		about that stuff.

				EDDIE
		Nah, why should you?

				JORDY
		I don't even watch TV.

				EDDIE
		Good.  Good.  Commendable.

	Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.

				JORDY
		Did you get a report from the M.E.?

				EDDIE
		Sure.  But I would like to ask you
		something.  You got a problem with me?

				JORDY
		If you found me steppin' on your crime
		scene - it might piss you off, too.
			(then)
		What about the report?

				EDDIE
		You were right, they were both dead
		before the fire.  The male was stabbed
		so hard the killer broke off the tip of
		the knife in his spine.  That's usually
		an indicator of something personal.

	Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie.

				JORDY
		The Super said he'd seen her before but
		she didn't live here.

				EDDIE
		Pretty.

				JORDY
			(acts as if he didn't notice)
		Hmmmm.

				EDDIE
		Maybe you don't care about that either.
			(beat)
		Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

				JORDY
		Who says she's a suspect?

	Jordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on.

				EDDIE
		What would you call her?

				JORDY
		Look, I'm not even sure she has anything
		to do with this.  I saw her outside
		after the fire - thought it was a lead. 
		Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was
		visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

	Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.

				EDDIE
		Obviously they weren't having sex.  As
		you pointed out.  So why go through all
		the trouble of putting 'em like that?

	Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.

				JORDY
		Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone
		trying to send a message.  Burial rites
		are taken very seriously in Eastern
		Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. 
		Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
		it's like condemning them to hell.

				EDDIE
		Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? 
		Hungary?

				JORDY
		Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been
		fighting the Germans and the Russians
		for a thousand years.  These are very
		intense people and they take things
		personally.

	Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.

				EDDIE
		Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? 
		Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay.
			(to Jordy)
		We've got another murder - in a hotel on
		Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said
		the room was rented by a Russian...

	Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch. 

				JORDY
		I'll come with you.

				EDDIE
		There wasn't a fire.  There'll be
		nothing for you to do.

				JORDY
		I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll
		learn something.

				EDDIE
		This isn't homicide school.

				JORDY
		My parents are from Poland.  I can help
		with the Eastern European angle.

				EDDIE
		You're Polish?

				JORDY
		My folks are.

				EDDIE
		Stay here.
						

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY

	Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
	picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST.  Eddie's photo is on
	the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires. 
	Underneath his picture the caption reads, "DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
	FLEMMING'S ON IT."  The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
	standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
	front page.  The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
	Oleg himself.

				OLEG
		This is second day in America.  First
		day was very exciting.  Full of thrills
		and chills.  Over there, is co-star of
		my new movie, Emil!

	He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.

				EMIL
			(to vendor)
		Who is he?

				VENDOR
		New York's finest.  This is his case.

	The VENDOR - picks up People.  Stephen Geller is on the
	cover.

				VENDOR (CONT'D)
		This all you want?  

				EMIL
		Do you know how much killer gets for
		movie rights?

				VENDOR
			(People)
		In here, says he wants a million.

				EMIL
		Million?!  The killer gets one million
		dollars for a television interview?

				VENDOR
		Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
		serial killer - half a million for his
		interview.  And how much you think
		Monica got for writing book about the
		President coming on to her?  It pays to
		be a killer or a whore in this country. 
		Look, you want magazine or not?

				EMIL
		Yes.  Both.

				OLEG
		And these.

	Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. 
	Emil pays for everything.

				EMIL
			(to Oleg)
		Get a taxi.

	Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
	and hails a taxi.  As Emil collects his change he sees an old
	BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.  The light's blinking
	WALK.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Let me help.

	Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.

				BLIND WOMAN
		Thank you, son.

	Emil watches her walk on.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	The hotel room is a hive of activity.  GIL is dusting the
	dresser for prints.  Another officer is stripping the bed and
	putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.  As Eddie
	enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
	the doorway taking pictures.

				EDDIE
		Where is she?

				LEON
		Takin' a bath.

				EDDIE
		Any I.D.?

				LEON
		Still unknown but we're running prints. 
		Kid over there caught the case.

	Jordy enters.  Leon steps in his way.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Sorry...PD only.

				EDDIE
		It's okay.

	Eddie walks over to a young detective.  TOMMY CULLEN, only
	26, is excited to meet Eddie.

				TOMMY
		Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you. 
		Nice to meet you.  Here's what we got. 
		A girl in there, figure her to be a
		prostitute, looks like she was fighting
		for her life.  She's got defense wounds
		on her hands.  Right this way - in the
		bathroom.

				EDDIE
		After you.

	Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.  There's blood
	splattered all over the walls and the floor.  Honey's topless
	body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. 
	MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
	body.

				TOMMY
		Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

				JORDY
		Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. 
		Who said he sounded Russian?

				TOMMY
		The clerk?

				EDDIE
		Check the switchboard, see what phone
		calls were made from this room.

				TOMMY
		I'll do it.

	Tommy heads out.  Eddie takes out his cigar holder.  Slides
	out what's left of his cigar.  Re-lights it.  Looks down at
	Honey's body in the bathtub.  Gil's dusting the tub for
	prints.

				MURPHY
		Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub
		is dry except for the blood.

				EDDIE
		Any of you guys take a piss lately?

	Gil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Do the seat for me.

	Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie
	stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the
	unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Only one guys checked in?

				LEON
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide
		school?  Here - make yourself useful.

	Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Our killer...our killer's standing here
		slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. 
		The blood is splattering this way.  It's
		on this wall...
			(pointing to the right of
			 Jordy)
		And there's some specks over here.
			(to the left of Jordy)
		There's nothing here because someone was
		standing right here.  Someone big.  And
		he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. 
		He wouldn't walk out of here like that.
			(turning to Murphy)
		Murphy, what kind of knife you think
		we're talking about here?

	Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
	blood-splattered wall.

				MURPHY
		If you look here where he missed and hit
		the wall you see that the marks aren't
		deep but they're kinda wide... not your
		everyday kitchen or pocket knife.

				EDDIE
		What if the tip was broken off?

				MURPHY
		Could be.  Then we should find it here
		somewhere.

				EDDIE
		I think we've already found it.

	Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
	detective, returns.

				TOMMY
		There was only one call from this room
		last night.  I dialed it.  It's an
		escort service.

				LEON
		Did you identify yourself?

				TOMMY
		Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.

				EDDIE
		Call communications and get an address
		on that number.

	Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
	address on it.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Good work.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY

	Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.

				JORDY
		You goin' to the escort service?

				EDDIE
		You got any better ideas?

				JORDY
		Mind if I ride along with you?

				EDDIE
		This has nothing to do with your fire.

				JORDY
		But what if it does?  You might need my
		help.

	As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.

				MAN
		Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
		my son?

	EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY

	Jordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
	the man's back.

				EDDIE
		I'll let you know what happens.

				JORDY
		This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in
		your way - we can talk the case over.

				EDDIE
		Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. 
		If you win you can come with me.  If you
		don't win, you don't come.

				JORDY
		I'll call it... tails.

	Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads.

	Jordy flips the coin and it's heads.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Heads.  See, you lost twice.
			(beat)
		Okay.  Get in.

	Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy
	can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the
	sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time
	lets Jordy get in.


				WHIP PAN TO:

	INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door.  Eddie knocks
	and flips a coin to Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Oh here.  A souvenir.

	Jordy takes the quarter.  Not understanding what Eddie means. 
	He looks at the quarter.

				JORDY
		Two heads.

				EDDIE
		Better than one.

	Eddie suckered him with the coin toss.  Jordy reacts.  Eddie
	laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth.  Knocks again.  We hear
	ROSE HELLER.

				ROSE (O.S.)
		Who's there?

				EDDIE
		Police.  We'd like to ask you a few
		questions.

				ROSE (O.S.)
		I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna
		contact my attorney...

				EDDIE
			(commands)
		Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective
		Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

	Rose reacts.  Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
	door!  

				ROSE
		You!  I've seen you on TV!

	Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.

				ROSE (CONT'D)
		C'mon in.  C'mon in!

	INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	They enter.

				ROSE
		Just a minute.  Shit.  And I don't have
		a camera.  Hold on a second.

	Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
	in Afrikaner.  We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door.  Eddie
	looks around - taking in the place.  FOUR GIRLS are on
	phones.  Two girls take orders for customers.  The other two
	work the phone sex lines.  Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
	Eddie and Jordy:

				ROSE (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				EDDIE
		We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of
		your girls was killed last night at the
		King Edward Hotel.

				ROSE
		Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?

				JORDY
		Do you remember the man who called?

	Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.

				ROSE
		Yeah.  He wanted a girl from
		Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
		'cause once they get there, you know, it
		doesn't really matter - Honey was
		killed...?  Poor girl...

				EDDIE
		Do you have any Czech girls working for
		you?

				ROSE
		No.

				EDDIE
		Did you tell him you did?

	A BUTCH GIRL enters.  Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.

				ROSE
			(Afrikaner)
		Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

				EDDIE
		What are you saying?

				ROSE
		Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me
		about her, too.

	Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.

				JORDY
		This her?

				ROSE
		Yeah.  Sort of.  I tried to recruit her,
		gave her my card.  She said she'd think
		about it but I never heard from her.

				BUTCH GIRL
			(Afrikaner)
		Beautiful eyes.

				EDDIE
		Who came by looking for her?

				ROSE
		He said he was her cousin.  I told him
		where she works.  They were just here.

				EDDIE
		Describe him.

				ROSE
		Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second
		guy with him was...shorter, with a
		wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn
		his videocamera off me.

				EDDIE
		He had a videocamera?  Where is she? 
		Quickly!

				ROSE
		She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon
		on 63rd and Madison.

	EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

	As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.

	INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

	Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
	astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up
	his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well.

				EDDIE
		Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. 
		Hair salon.  Ludwig's. 

				JORDY
			(overlapping)
		I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 
		63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be
		there already.

	Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer
	he was holding between his legs - finishes it.

				EDDIE
		You thirsty?

				JORDY
		I'm on duty.

				EDDIE
			(drinking)
		So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and
		you cover the back.

				JORDY
		Of course.

				EDDIE
		Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I
		was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a
		door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
		yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! 
		What'd you dream about?

				JORDY
		I wanted to run up to a building on
		fire, kick in the door, rush into the
		smoke and save a kid.

				EDDIE
		Then I guess we're doin' this the right
		way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a
		burning building I'll gladly let you go
		first.

	Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.

	INT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY

	We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon -
	it's big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.

				OLEG (O.S.)
		Daphne Handlova?

				RECEPTIONIST
		Daphne?  In the back.  Probably
		shampooing a customer's hair.

	Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the
	owner, is with her.

				LUDWIG
		Why are you messing with your hair color
		again?  You're going to kill your hair. 
		You won't look good with black hair.

				DAPHNE
		I want to do it, alright?

				LUDWIG
		Well, then do it after work.  A
		customer's waiting.

	He leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns
	on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She
	backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!

	TO THE BACKYARD

	There's a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. 
	Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the
	corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen
	knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
	the broken tip against her throat.

				EMIL
		I...I have a temper.

	She looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		When I lose it, I lose control.  I
		didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole
		from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to
		prison, they beat me.  I still didn't
		tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos
		like a brother...

	The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
	softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
			(in English)
		I'm not a killer.

	The back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as
	Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil
	leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.

				LUDWIG
		Daphne, will you be coming back to work?

				DAPHNE
		In a minute, Ludwig.

	Ludwig leaves.

				EMIL
		Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a
		whore.  But washing hair?  This is no
		job for a woman as beautiful as you. 
		They should be washing your hair.

	Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
	it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		I don't want to kill you.  But if you
		talk, I will.
			(whispers)
		I thought you'd want these.

	He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit.  Oleg
	follows.  Jordy arrives.

				JORDY
		...Daphne?

	She says nothing.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I'm a fire marshal.  You remember me
		from the other night?  You are Daphne,
		right?

	She says nothing.  Eddie arrives.  Daphne turns.  Recognizing
	Eddie.

				EDDIE
		You don't have to be afraid.  We're here
		to protect you.  Come with me.  We want
		to talk to you.  You speak English
		alright?

	Eddie looks at Jordy.  Takes Daphne by the arm.
		
		EXT. LUDWIG'S SALON - CONTINUOUS

	As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
	her hand.  He reaches for her hand.  Opens it.  It's a
	brushed gold necklace.

				EDDIE
		Did he give you these?  Was he just
		here?

	Eddie searches the streets.  Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
	corner.  Oleg is videotaping him.  Leon and Tommy pull up. 
	Korfin behind.  They all pop out.  Eddie grabs Leon -
	squeezes his arm - quietly.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		The other side of the street.  The guy
		with the videocamera.
			(back to Jordy)
		Don't look - put her in the car.
			(to Leon)
		Stay this side.

				LEON
			(back to Tommy)
		Stay with her.

	They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
	attention of Oleg and Emil.

	A VIDEO CLOSE-UP

	of the scene from across the corner.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Put the fuckin' camera down!  Let's go!

	Emil starts to flee.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

	What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
	Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
	Emil.  Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
	breath.

				EDDIE
		Split up!

	Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. 
	Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. 
	They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
	missing him.  Emil seems to have disappeared.

	Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the
	corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon
	crashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the
	gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. 
	People are running from the scene.  Emil takes Leon's wallet. 
	He is distracted by LAUGHTER.  Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.

				OLEG
		Emil, look!

	Oleg swivels with the videocamera.  Korfin is running toward
	them - pushing through the crowd.  Emil FIRES!  Korfin is
	blown backwards.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		Perfect!  Cut.  Print!

	Eddie arrives.  Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
	blood.  Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,
	shot in the side.  Jordy cradles his partner.

				EDDIE
		Are you hit?

				LEON
		No.  I'm okay.

				JORDY
			(to Korfin)
		Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

				KORFIN
		It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

				JORDY
		Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

	Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. 
	Cars screech out of the way!  Eddie crouches, taking aim at
	Emil, who is almost two blocks away.  It's an impossible
	shot, out of range.

	But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two
	blocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
	astonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. 
	Runs.  Eddie holsters his weapon.  Pulls out a handkerchief. 
	Dabs Leon's wounds.

				LEON
		He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming
		the whole time!

				EDDIE
		I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't
		worry, we'll get those fuckers.
						

				DISSOLVE TO:

	EMS VEHICLE

	Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
	an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon's
	bloody face.  Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
	restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
	her cameraman.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective - can you tell us what
		happened here?

				EDDIE
		I can't talk right now.  We have some
		things to take care of.

	Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of
	Nicolette.

	Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
	maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is
	where Eddie and Jordy are headed.

				NICOLETTE
		I understand, but I noticed that the
		Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this
		somehow related to the fire department?

				EDDIE
		I really can't give out any information
		right now at this point.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  But I do understand that your
		partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. 
		Is that correct?

				EDDIE
		He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll
		be fine.

				NICOLETTE
		Do you have the suspect in custody?

				EDDIE
		Um...now is not a good time, okay. 
		Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. 
		I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
		Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

				NICOLETTE
			(to cameraman)
		Alright, cut, cut, cut.

	Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
	shoulder.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
			(to Eddie)
		Eddie, are you okay?

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.

				EDDIE
		Alright?

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.

				EDDIE
		Alright.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.

	Eddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her,
	then enters.

	INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY

	Jordy talks to Daphne. 

				DAPHNE
		I told your partner, I can't help.  I
		didn't see anything.

				EDDIE
		C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know
		these people?

				DAPHNE
		Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower
		was broken, she let me use theirs.

				EDDIE
		Go on.

	She says nothing.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Whether you tell us or not, we'll find
		out.  Better if it comes from you.

				DAPHNE
		If I tell you, will you arrest me?

				EDDIE
		Arrest you for what?  Why would we
		arrest you?

	She still hesitates.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

				JORDY
		She just saw two of her friends killed! 
		They probably threatened her.

				EDDIE
		Is that all there is?

	She looks at Eddie.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Are you here illegally?  Don't worry
		about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. 
		They won't deport you.

				DAPHNE
		No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

	She clams up.

				JORDY
		Why not?

				EDDIE
		Something back home?

	Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across
	from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her.

				DAPHNE
		...my little sister and I shared a flat -
		I came home one night and a man was
		raping her.  His gun was on the chair...
		He came at me and I shot him.

				JORDY
			(optimistic)
		Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

				DAPHNE
		Yes, but he was a cop.

				EDDIE
		A cop?

				DAPHNE
			(beat)
		I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like
		the South here.  The Police is right, a
		civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

				EDDIE
		Look, we can help you but right now we
		have to deal with what's happening here. 
		Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

				DAPHNE
		You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

				JORDY
			(to Eddie)
		Can I talk to you?

	Eddie steps away with Jordy.  Keeping his eyes on Daphne. 
	She tries to listen.

				EDDIE
		She's fucked.  Even if that story is
		true.

				JORDY
		Raw deal.

	Eddie tilts his head.  Measures Jordy.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I
		get, they're all yours.  Just let me
		have a first crack at her.

				EDDIE
		You wanna talk to her alone?

				JORDY
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		What would your girlfriend think of
		that?

				JORDY
		I don't have a girlfriend.

				EDDIE
		My point exactly.

				JORDY
		I'm serious here.

				EDDIE
		So am I.

				JORDY
		C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're
		a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

				EDDIE
		You're her Savior?  Is she the kid
		you're gonna save from the burning
		building?

				JORDY
		You know what I'm saying here.

	Eddie looks at his watch.  Thinks it over.  Measures Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a
		head start.  You take her to the station
		house.  Don't let her out of your sight. 
		She's the only warm body we got left.

				JORDY
		Hey.  I'm a professional.

				EDDIE
		Women like that have a way of turning
		professionals into amateurs.

	He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.

	INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY

	Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
	stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
	pink flesh taken out of his ankle.  Emil grabs some toilet
	paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
	with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle.  He grits teeth
	in pain.  The lights go out.  Then Oleg adjusts the
	fluorescent light above the sink.

				OLEG
		Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's
		more moody... like a scene from THE
		THIRD MAN.

				EMIL
		Shut up.

				OLEG
		Does it hurt?

	Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.

				EMIL
		This is nothing.

	Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.

				OLEG
		Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

				EMIL
		Don't want to film this?

	We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
	expression, it's horrible.

	INT. JORDY'S CAR - DAY

	Daphne rides in the backseat.  Jordy's watching her in the
	rearview.

				DAPHNE
		Now I become custody of police
		department?

				JORDY
		If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
		they'll help you with your situation.

				DAPHNE
		I will if they don't send me back.

				JORDY
		They won't until this is over.

	She looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling
	her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.

				DAPHNE
		Are you married?

				JORDY
		Divorced.

				DAPHNE
		Do you live alone?
			(beat)
		I've been in these clothes since...the
		killings.  Could we stop at your place? 
		I could take a shower...before I go into
		custody?

	Jordy looks at her.  Can't quite tell if she's trying to
	manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
	all the shit starts.

				JORDY
		I can't take you to my place.

				DAPHNE
		Somewhere else?

	Jordy looks at her...
		

	EDDIE

	Staring right at us.

				EDDIE
		I want to talk to you about something
		serious.

	He holds up the diamond engagement ring.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I want to live the rest of my life with
		you...I don't know you've been married
		before and I've never been married, but
		I do love you, and...

	Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
	proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. 
	Leon's blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
	tonic.

				PAULIE
		She's here.

	Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. 
	He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and
	hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps
	Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his
	coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens
	himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
	drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie
	hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
	exits.  Paulie follows.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	It's lunchtime...it's crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a
	table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
	the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. 
	Gives him a kiss on the cheek.

				NICOLETTE
		Hey, honey.

				EDDIE
		Hey.

	She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
	down across the table.  There's a long pause - they just look
	at each other.

				NICOLETTE
		What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at
		me?  I just wanted a statement.

				EDDIE
		I can't...I can't answer you just
		because you want me to answer you!

				NICOLETTE
		You didn't have to embarrass me in front
		of my colleagues.  You could give me
		something.

				EDDIE
		Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you,
		sweetheart?  Oh...

				NICOLETTE
		Stop it.

				EDDIE
		Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
		the cameras and say, do you mind if we
		just work something out?

				NICOLETTE
		Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't
		patronize me.

				EDDIE
		I'm not.

				NICOLETTE
		Yes you are.  I'm not just some
		reporter.  I don't just stick a
		microphone in your face.  You could give
		me something.

				EDDIE
		Yeah, well you took the camera and put
		it right down on the evidence.  That
		was...

				NICOLETTE
		That was good.  You were holding the
		evidence.

				EDDIE
		You were merciless.  You didn't give a
		shit if you got me or not.

				NICOLETTE
		Well, who was it that taught me how to
		do that?  Huh?

				EDDIE
		You're ruthless.

				NICOLETTE
		You're not so bad yourself.

	They look at each other.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		C'mere.

	They kiss.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Look at this.  You have blood on your
		shirt.  Whose is it?

				EDDIE
		Could be Leon's.

				NICOLETTE
		Jesus.  And last week you came over with
		blood on your shoes.  What am I going to
		do with you?

	Eddie takes her hand.

				EDDIE
		You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes
		might look nice with another pair of
		shoes next to them in the closet.

	She looks at him.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		You know, Nicky, I've been married twice
		before.  My first wife was a
		professional woman, didn't have time for
		children.  My second wife...I never
		wanted to go home to her.

	Nicolette's phone rings.  Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
	phone.

				NICOLETTE
		What are you doing?  What are you
		saying?

	Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.  Eddie stares at it.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Eddie?

	Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Don't worry about the damn phone.  I
		won't answer it.

				EDDIE
		Answer the phone.

				NICOLETTE
		No.  Tell me what you want to say.

				EDDIE
		Answer it.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for
		a second.  They only call me when it's
		an emergency.  Just hold that thought.
			(into the phone)
		Can you call back?

				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
		We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get
		in a cab.

				NICOLETTE
		What're you talking about?

				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
		Katie.  We don't know where she is.  We
		can't find her.  You gotta anchor the
		5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now.

				NICOLETTE
		What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.

	The line disconnects.  She collapses the phone.  Turns to
	Eddie.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They
		want me to anchor tonight!

				EDDIE
		That's good.

				NICOLETTE
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		Well, that's great.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go
		now, we're in the middle of something
		here.

				EDDIE
		No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

				NICOLETTE
		No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to
		know what you're talking about.  You
		know, the shoe thing and the marriages
		and...

				EDDIE
		I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it
		tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll
		talk.  We'll talk.

				NICOLETTE
		Promise?

				EDDIE
		I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be
		great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just
		imagine that, uh... Just look into the
		lens and imagine you're talking to me.

				NICOLETTE
		Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're
		not patronizing me.

				EDDIE
		Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

				NICOLETTE
		I love you.

	They kiss.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Okay, til tonight.

				EDDIE
		Tonight.

				NICOLETTE
		You promise?

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I promise.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by
		my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
		and maybe just test them out next to
		yours...How's that... Would that be a
		good thing.

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.

				EDDIE
		See you later.  Good luck.

				NICOLETTE
		Thank you.

				EDDIE
		Don't be late.

	She walks out.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY

	Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire
	station is empty.

				JORDY
		The men are out of quarters - practicing
		putting out fires.

				DAPHNE
		So...the station is empty?

				JORDY
		Yeah.  This way.

	He gestures toward the stairs.

	INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes
	never leaving Jordy's.

				JORDY
		You considered becoming a prostitute?

				DAPHNE
		Yes, I considered it.

				JORDY
		Did you ever turn tricks before?

				DAPHNE
		No.

				JORDY
		What about back home?

				DAPHNE
		No.

	Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no
		one.  I couldn't get a job because you
		have to have a green card to get work. 
		They approached me - I could've made a
		lot of money.  I considered it, but...
		it's not who I am.  They pay me below
		the table at Ludwig's.

				JORDY
		So you were never a prostitute?

				DAPHNE
		What are you asking me?

				JORDY
		I'm just trying to find out who you are.

	She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's
	hinting.

				DAPHNE
		Can you let me go?

	She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
	kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning
	and backs up slightly.

				JORDY
		Showers are this way.

	Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
	closer.

				DAPHNE
		You could shower with me.

	Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks
	away.  Gestures towards the showers. 
	Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the
	showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are
	lined with shower stalls.

				JORDY
		I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.

	He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the
	window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the
	street.

	JORDY

	gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He
	checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We
	follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he
	notices the window.  It's open.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

	He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns -
	looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through
	the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over -
	quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain
	aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding
	herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Are you alright?

	Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.

				DAPHNE
		I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

				JORDY
		I know.

				DAPHNE
		You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was
		desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a
		cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to
		me when I got to prison?

				JORDY
		They're not gonna send you right back.

				DAPHNE
		I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. 
		Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this
		time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look
		anyone in the eyes. 
		Always afraid that someone would find
		out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

	He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.

				JORDY
		You can trust me.

	She embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a
	moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her.
		
		INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY

	CLOSE UP

	on a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets
	down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands
	abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls
	back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.  He is
	taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his
	teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed
	over in pain.  He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews
	them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a
	beer.

	Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the
	"People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller. 
	Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the
	videocamera tilts back up to his face.

				OLEG
		What is it?

				EMIL
		The video of Milos and Tamina - I told
		you to erase it.

				OLEG
		I did.

				EMIL
		And the whore's murder?  You didn't
		erase that either, did you?  Don't lie,
		I won't be angry.

				OLEG
		Why not?

				EMIL
		Put the camera down, Oleg.

	Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil
	removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks
	up Eddie Flemming's name.

				OLEG
		What is that?

				EMIL
		What does it look like?  It's an address
		book!

	Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.

				OLEG
		Let me get a shot of it.

				EMIL
		Sit down!

				OLEG
		This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

	Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		Why won't you be angry at me for keeping
		my movie?

	Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps
	away.  Oleg follows.
		

	INT. PRECINCT - DAY

	It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's
	desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more
	aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting
	Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns
	and sees Jordy and Daphne.

				DUFFY
		Hey.  Warsaw.

	Jordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench.

				JORDY
		Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

				DUFFY
		I came to see how the investigation was
		going.
			(looks at Daphne)
		I called and you're not here.  I wait up
		at the station and you don't even show
		up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my
		call.  Where the hell have you been?!

	Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne.

				JORDY
		Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. 
		We stopped there... so she could get
		cleaned up.

				DUFFY
		What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

				JORDY
		I let her take a shower.

				DUFFY
		A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

				JORDY
		No!  Nothing happened.

				DUFFY
		Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a
		homicide witness to take a shower after
		your partner was shot?  Are you out of
		your fucking mind??  Are you having that
		much trouble gettin' dates?!

				EDDIE (O.S.)
		I told him to take her there.

	Jordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy -
	the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward
	Hotel - is coming out of the back office.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Tommy, get her outta here.

	Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.

				TOMMY
		This way, ma'am.

				EDDIE
		There was too much press hangin' around
		there.  I didn't want her face on the
		news.  So I told him to take her to a
		quiet area until things settled down.

				DUFFY
		Oh.

				EDDIE
		It was my decision, not his.

				DUFFY
		Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
		and every now and then I'd like to be
		included in decisions.

				EDDIE
		Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
		the press conference.  How about that? 
		The case is all yours.

				DUFFY
		Oh yeah...?  Alright.

				EDDIE
			(to Jordy)
		I'm ready to be briefed.
			(to Duffy)
		Excuse us.

				DUFFY
			(to Eddie)
		Yeah, sure.
			(to Jordy)
		Beep me when you're ready for the press
		conference.

				JORDY
		Will do, Chief.

	Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk -
	toward the back and to his office.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Eddie, I...

	Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Wait.

	INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM'S SQUAD - DAY

	A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. 
	Eddie enters with Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Guys...give me a few minutes?

	They empty out.

				JORDY
		Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't
		touch her.

				EDDIE
		Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna
		believe you didn't...including me.

				JORDY
		I took her there for a shower and that's
		it.

				EDDIE
		Just a shower?

	Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look.

				JORDY
		Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing
		happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably
		think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

				EDDIE
		No, I don't think you were a fool, I
		just think you were stupid about it.  I
		mean, to say the least, you outta know
		better.  You don't know her well enough. 
		She's got the potential to fucking hang
		you even if she suggests that you made a
		pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can
		deny it all you want, but it will not
		make one fucking bit of difference. 
		You're dead.

				JORDY
		I told you, you know, I thought I was
		doing the right thing, you know, I think
		she's innocent.

				EDDIE
		Well, it's not up to you to decide
		whether she's innocent or not.  Don't
		you understand, that's why you're a
		professional.

				JORDY
		But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a
		limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda
		heard her there.  Tellin' her whole
		story...I believed her.

				EDDIE
		How you go out on a limb for somebody is
		by giving her a number of an Immigration
		lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an
		Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help
		her. 
		But you can't get involved in her like
		that.  You're gonna jeopardize your
		career, your life and you're gonna
		jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you
		another piece of advice.  Maybe you
		don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a
		little secret - the whole fuckin' world
		watches television.  And when you get
		out there, they know your face.  And the
		little fame, the little fuckin' itty
		bitty fame that I get in this city makes
		it a lot easier for my job.  And I get
		more done because of it.

	Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.

				JORDY
		Why'd you help me back there with the
		Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like
		that?

				EDDIE
		You know, I don't know.  I like you. 
		You remind me of a puppy I used to have. 
		He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
		still kept him.

	Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out.  He sticks it in
	his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the
	match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The
	homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.
		

	INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the
	door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials.

				EDDIE
		It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did
		they check the hospitals?  Airports? 
		Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We
		should be all over everywhere - with
		dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys
		are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...

	He looks at the flowers.  Decides to put the case behind him
	for a moment.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I'll call you later.

	He HANGS up.  Arranges the flowers in a vase.  So they look
	perfect.  Sets them on the coffee table.  Fills out a card,
	writes, "Nicky, I love you. 
	Will you marry me?"  He sticks the card in the flowers -
	turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
	the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself a
	drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
	flowers.  There's a knock at the door.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Coming!

	Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.  But the hallway is
	empty.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky!?!?

	No answer.  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
	his hand.  Walks toward the elevator.  Doesn't notice the
	shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. 
	Eddie turns.  No sign of anyone.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky?!

	He walks back toward his apartment.  Turns and locks the
	door.  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
	head with a gun.  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD!

	A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE

	as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
	to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.  Emil is sitting
	in front of him.  On the coffee table alongside him are the
	flowers in a vase.  They've ransacked the place.  Emil has
	Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money.  He's smoking
	one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond
	engagement ring and card.  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
	positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.  He moves to the
	corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
	Eddie's face.

				EMIL
		So...who's Nicky?

				EDDIE
		What do you want?

				EMIL
		Your opinion.
			(leaning forward)
		You see, they going to make a movie
		about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

				EDDIE
			(sarcastic)
		What's your accomplishment.

				EMIL
		I kill someone famous.

				EDDIE
		Then do it, asshole.

				EMIL
		Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who
		plays you will want to die like hero.

	Eddie looks at the videocamera.  Emil answers Eddie's look.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		So tabloids don't have to do re
		enactments.  They going to have real
		movie this time.

				EDDIE
		If you kill me and film it you're
		putting a noose around your neck.

	Emil turns to Oleg.

				EMIL
		Turn it off.

	Oleg obeys.  Emil turns to Eddie.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy
		men would film their murders?
			(gestures to Eddie)
		So we kill someone famous and if we are
		caught, we are sent to mental hospital. 
		But what good is money there?  Because
		once in hospital I say I not crazy. 
		Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see
		psychiatrists.  They must certify we are
		sane and because of your - what is law
		called?
			(Eddie says nothing)
		Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double
		Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same
		crime twice.  We come out free, rich and
		famous!

				OLEG
		Good idea!

				EDDIE
		You really think you'll be able to fool
		a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin'
		stupid are you?

				EMIL
		Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry
		baby talk shows all day long.  Not only
		will Americans believe me, they'll cry
		for me.
			(laughs)
		So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
		like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? 
		Maybe you can propose to her now?

	Eddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on
	Eddie's cigar.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Okay.  He has nothing to say.
			(signaling Oleg)
		Start the camera!

				OLEG
		Cut!

	Emil looks at Oleg.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say 'action!'

	Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what I have to put up
	with."  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		And...action!

	Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddie
	suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,
	backing out of Eddie's reach.

				EMIL
		Bad last moment - I cut that out.

	Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's
	left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
	gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standing
	and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over
	into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
	Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.

	Oleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around
	with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
	him to the wall.

	Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
	Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
	with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
	repeatedly.

	Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
	from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
	onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and
	leaving Oleg on the sofa.

	Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
	in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
	gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
	not clear in the darkness who has the gun.

	Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
	videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
	as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
	toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
	window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.

	Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
	toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
	the stomach.

	Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
	STOMACH.

	Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
	the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got
	stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be
	dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain
	is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
	close up.

	Emil looks at Eddie.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Die.  Die.

	Emil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
	off, suffocating him.
		

	BLACKNESS

	We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
	feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,
	in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. 
	We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
	tiny pixel on a TV screen.

	WIDENING

	further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's
	an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
	dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
	over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
	his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with
	the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio
	from Eddie's funeral.

				NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
		..Detective Flemming was one of the most
		decorated NYPD detectives in the history
		of New York.  He made several thousand
		arrests during his career, including the
		famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by
		the community in which he served.  His
		partner eulogized him...

	Leon is at the mic. 

				LEON (ON T.V.)
		...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
		and my partner...he taught me the
		meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man
		in every sense of the word.  I'll miss
		him...
			(choking on tears)
		Sleep well, brother.

	Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace."  Oleg PANS from the TV
	and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -
	carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long
	hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
	pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. 
	Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,
	the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
	table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
	revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	It's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many
	who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black
	ribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake -
	boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet
	has been laid out.

	Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He
	greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.

				HAWKINS
		Awful...what an awful day.  He was New
		York City.

	Hawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's
	Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him.

				TOMMY
		I never got to tell him how much I
		admired him.

				HAWKINS
		I know, son, I know.  We all loved him.

	Hawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of
	the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves
	to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at
	him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. 
	Definitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins.

				NICOLETTE
		You know...you know he was gonna propose
		to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd
		written out to me.  And a ring
		box...these fuckers that killed him -
		have my ring.  They have my diamond
		engagement ring...

	Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.

				HAWKINS
		I know.

				NICOLETTE
		What do you mean you know?  He told you
		he was gonna propose to me?

				HAWKINS
		Well, he...

				NICOLETTE
			(overriding)
		I want to hear everything he said.

				HAWKINS
		I'm trying to tell you.

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.  Go ahead.

				HAWKINS
		That morning.  He was talking to me and
		Leon about marriage.

				NICOLETTE
		Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. 
		He started making overtures - talking
		about little shoes next to his in his
		closet but I got a call to anchor - and
		I walked out on him.  I walked out on
		him when he was trying to ask me to
		marry him!!

	Nicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		I'd never had a great relationship
		before.  I'd never made great choices
		with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to
		know.  He was older, my parents told me
		I was nuts to get involved with him. 
		But he was so great to me.  Always
		encouraging, telling me I could do
		anything...
			(beat)
		He was the one.  You know, I'd give up
		everything - everything - for just a
		little more time.  I would've spent
		fifteen minutes with him if that's all I
		knew I had.

	She's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him
	off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A
	woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.

				MAGGIE
		Robert...?

				HAWKINS
		What are you doing here?

				MAGGIE
			(holding a cellular)
		You've got a call.

				HAWKINS
		I can't talk to anybody right now, can't
		you see I'm busy!  I can't talk
		business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.
			(to Paulie)
		Get her a whiskey.

				MAGGIE
		Trust me, you'll want to take this call.

	Robert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.

				HAWKINS
		Hello?  Who is this?
			(listens)
		How do I know this is you?

	Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. 
	Backs away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he
	looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		Where?

	We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
	theater.  Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws
	glances into the theater.

				EMIL
		Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the
		Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my
		next film.

				HAWKINS
			(low)
		Look asshole.  I've been threatened by
		better than you.

				EMIL
		No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened
		you.

				HAWKINS
		I'll meet you on one condition - I get
		exclusivity and you surrender to me.

				EMIL
		We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock
		gives you time to go to bank.  Three
		hundred thousand dollars.

				HAWKINS
		What?  It doesn't work that way.

				EMIL
			(incensed)
		If you don't want my film - I'll call
		another show.  And they will show it.

				HAWKINS
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

				EMIL
		Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk
		about surrendering.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the
	phone back to Maggie.  She's looking at him.  Excited. 
	Hawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY

	Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin's arm is in
	a sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their
	dress uniforms.  Korfin walks over to them.

				KORFIN
		How was it?

				JORDY
			(numb)
		Not good.

	Jordy's quiet.  Dazed.  Nobody can believe Eddie's gone.

				DUFFY
			(nods to Daphne)
		Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

				KORFIN
		Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

				DUFFY
			(to Korfin)
		Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let
		her pick up her clothes and take her
		straight to Hoover Street.  You got
		that?

				KORFIN
		Yeah.

	Jordy looks at her.  Duffy sees them hold each other's look.

				JORDY
		Chief - mind if I take her?

				DUFFY
		Okay.  But not water sports.

	Duffy walks out.  Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. 
	Korfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello
	who points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.

				MAN
		Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?

				JORDY
		Yeah.

				MAN
			(shoving papers in Jordy's
			 hand)
		Consider yourself served.

	Jordy opens the papers.  Korfin puts Daphne in the car. 
	Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.

				KORFIN
		Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the
		department and the city of New York for
		10 million?  Who is Zwangendaba?

	Jordy remembers...and gets more depressed.

				JORDY
		The mugger.
						
		EXT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	It's an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. 
	Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering
	her to the door.  He is edgy.  Jumpy.  Looking around.

				DAPHNE
		Are you alright?

				JORDY
		I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

				DAPHNE
		I'm sorry.

	He looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the
	front door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls
	Daphne out of the way.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
			(in Czech to the man)
		Hello.  How are you?

	INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of
	flowers are outside Daphne's apartment.

				JORDY
		What's this?

	She takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne
	reads: "Good luck with all your troubles.  I'm here if you
	need me...Ludwig."

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Is he your boyfriend?

				DAPHNE
		Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

				JORDY
		If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

				DAPHNE
		If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest
		you find another girlfriend that isn't
		going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

	They're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension
	strong.

				JORDY
		A good Immigration lawyer could stall
		the process.  Eddie recommended one.

				DAPHNE
		No matter what happens...I'm glad I met
		you.

				JORDY
		I'm glad I met you.

	They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. 
	Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. 
	They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the
	hall.  Jordy clears his throat.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Let's get your stuff.

	He opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to
	her.  Gestures that it's okay to enter.

	INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	It's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. 
	The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking
	the same thought.  Another kiss. 

				JORDY
		You better get packed.

				DAPHNE
		Right.

	She holds his look.

				JORDY
		Do you have coffee?

				DAPHNE
		In the kitchen.

				JORDY
		I'll make some for us.

				DAPHNE
		I'll get my clothes.

	She heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He
	flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -
	SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO
	THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		Jordy!!!

				JORDY
		No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!

	Jordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows
	the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices
	a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it
	at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne
	SCREAMS!

				DAPHNE
		That's not mine!

	WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames
	leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
	because it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy
	CAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and
	JORDY'S HAND.

	He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. 
	Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it
	under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He
	hurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before
	the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. 
	Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
	chair through the window.

				JORDY
		Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!

	Too late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in
	the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along
	the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,
		make it quick, we're trapped!  8th
		Avenue and 44th Street.

	He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy
	kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that
	under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. 
	Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
	water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. 
	She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top
	of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.

				DAPHNE
		Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!

	Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		They were here!

	This freaks her out.  They were in her home.  She starts to
	panic.

				JORDY
		Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get
		down!

	He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.  In it is a CAN OF
	GASOLINE.  A virtual bomb.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Oh Jesus!

	Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing?

				DAPHNE
		Pouring it out!

	She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.  The
	FIRE is raging outside the bathroom.  The bathroom door is
	beginning to smoke and burn.  They are trapped.

	Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
	wall to the ceiling.  He throws his feet against the wall for
	leverage.  Pulls with all his might to break it loose.  It's
	creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		Oh shit!

	Jordy looks over.  The gasoline she's pouring out - is not
	going down the drain.  It's stopped up.  As soon as the fire
	gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!

	Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. 
	Daphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break
	it off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. 
	SOAKING THE WALLS.  They point the pipe toward the door,
	soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. 
	Trying to stop the fire from coming in.  He and Daphne are
	drenched.  And trapped.

	Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.  Starts SMASHING the wall
	behind them.  The wall to the adjacent apartment.

	VIDEO POV

	Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. 
	CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.

	OLEG

	is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.  Tenants from
	Daphne's building are fleeing down the fire escape.  Emil
	stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited.  He turns the
	camera on himself.

				OLEG
		This is great film!  You can see fire
		right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire
		Marshal is here.  Everything is so
		messy.  Everything is so crazy right
		here!  Look at this fire!  We made it! 
		90% of people who die in fire die from
		eating smoke.  So most likely they all
		die from eating smoke.

	The CAMERA PANS to Emil.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		And this is the man who started the
		fire.  Say something to your fans, Emil!

	Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens.

	DAPHNE'S BATHROOM

	Filled with smoke.  You can barely see Jordy or Daphne. 
	Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom
	in the apartment next door.  The smoke has a place to escape. 
	There's a 7-year old KID in there.  Standing in the bathroom. 
	Terrified.

				JORDY
		Get back!  Get out of the bathroom! 
		Run!

				7-YEAR OLD KID
		The hallway is on fire!

				JORDY
		It's okay.  I'm a fireman.  I'm going to
		help you.  Get back!  Now!

	Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom
	door catches fire.  It's seconds before the whole room will
	blow up.

	OLEG

	Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Fire engines have arrived.  The street is filled with
	gawkers.  Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
	the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
	with the other.  Carefully guarding his bandaged hand.  A
	fireman grabs the kid.  Another grabs Daphne.  Garcia and
	Korfin run to Jordy.

				GARCIA
		Jordy!  What the hell happened?!

				KORFIN
		Are you alright, man?  Lemme see the
		hand!

				JORDY
		Where's Daphne?  Daphne?

	He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes
	through the crowd.

				VOICE
		Isn't she a beauty?  She's my fire, look
		at that loom-up on her!

	Jordy turns - it's Max.  The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
	threw out of his office.  As a news crew arrives, Max turns
	to the cameras.

				MAX
		I did this!  I did this!  Take my
		picture!  I'm Max!  Max Gornick!

	Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away.

				JORDY
		Get outta here!

				KORFIN
		What the hell happened?

				JORDY
		They were inside.  They booby trapped
		her apartment!

	Korfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the
	b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING.

				DUFFY
		What the hell are you talking about??? 
		They're gonna do what?

	Jordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and
	is freaked.

	INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT

	JORDY'S POV

	as he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still
	wet.  The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still
	in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
	producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.

				TOMMY
		Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?!

				MAGGIE
		He's not on the premises!

				LEON
		I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it
		here this minute.

				MAGGIE
		Any request for the video must be
		directed to "Top Story's" attorney -
		Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you
		his number.

	Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes
	past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward
	Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries
	to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.

				LEON
		Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,
		I'll get a warrant for your arrest and
		shove it so far up your ass it'll come
		outta your mouth!

				MAGGIE
		I want your shield number!

				HAWKINS (O.S.)
		Viewer discretion advised!

				MAGGIE
			(pointing at the TV)
		You want the tape?  There it is!

	Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
	which is mounted in the lobby.  The "Top Story" logo flashes
	on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.

				HAWKINS
		What we are about to broadcast is very
		graphic footage...

	Everyone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a "Top
	Story" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins
	jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out.

	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT

	POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
	popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
	table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the
	glass - looking into the lens.

				EMIL
		America!  Who says you can't be success
		in America?  I arrived with nothing,
		knowing nobody - now look - I am a
		success story!

	The videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks
	suspiciously.

				OLEG
		You are success story?  I am success
		story!  Why do you say I and not we?

				EMIL
		Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a
		hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't
		you?  I gave you half of what they gave
		me.  Look - here we are!

	Emil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in
	Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
	watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins
	is introducing his show.

				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
		Good evening.  Welcome to "Top Story". 
		Tonight, I present to you material of a
		graphic and violent nature never before
		seen on television.  And I do so with a
		heavy heart.  You will be first-hand
		witness to the slaying of celebrated New
		York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
		Flemming.  It would be only normal to
		ask, why?  Why are we showing something
		so journalist, I must show it.  A
		democracy survives through the freedom
		of its media, and if we cannot see what
		is happening then we don't deserve our
		democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie
		Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I
		watched this footage and vowed to fight
		this violence with every molecule of my
		being from this day onward.  Hopefully,
		this will have a similar effect on you. 
		One final word, this material is
		absolutely not appropriate for children.

	The restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch.

				OLEG
		In movie they make of us, who do you
		think would act me?

				EMIL
		The one who got caught in the bathroom.
			(beat)
		George Michael.

	Emil laughs.  Oleg doesn't.

				OLEG
		I'm serious.

				EMIL
		Shut up.  Look!

	Emil points towards the TV.  "Top Story" is continuing.  The
	scene cuts to Emil's video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to
	the chair.  The light illuminating his face.

				OLEG (O.S.)
		This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say 'action.'
			(beat)
		And 'action!'

				EMIL
		Bad last moment - I cut it out.

	Emil looks at Oleg - furious.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		I told you to cut that out before we
		handed in the tape!

				OLEG
		Be quiet.  Watch.

	Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
	Eddie's temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then
	knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
	the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
	Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie
	and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the
	way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. 
	Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and
	he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The
	blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
	light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down
	for a CLOSE-UP.

				EMIL
		Die.  Die.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

	Hawkins' van drives across Times Square.  Jordy's car
	following.  We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast
	on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.  People stare up - stunned.

	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

	The dinner patrons are watching TV.  Shocked.  Emil glares at
	Oleg.

				EMIL
		Why did you leave that stuff in about
		you being the director?

				OLEG
		Because I am the director.  Don't you
		realize, if it wasn't for my film, for
		my talent, my idea to do this - no way
		would we be sitting here right now.

				EMIL
		Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

	Oleg tenses.  Emil laughs.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Aren't you just the cameraman?

	Oleg doesn't laugh.

				OLEG
		I'm serious...this - this is a great
		American film.  Full of violence and
		sex.  And I want my credit.

				EMIL
		Credit?

				OLEG
		Yes.  Before we hand in the next video -
		I put titles on it and my credit is
		going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

				EMIL
		Yes.  But there's only one problem - you
		want credit but the problem is - I don't
		share credit.

	Oleg is pissed.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		You got that?

				OLEG
		No, I don't get that!

				EMIL
		You think you are a director?  You are a
		fucking little, small Russian piece of
		shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate
		you.

	Emil slaps Oleg across the face.  Oleg stands up.  Emil
	suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the
	trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!  Emil squeezes off a
	shot through the crowded restaurant.  Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
	runs through the restaurant, escaping.  It's chaos. 
	Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
	confident, tough criminal attorney.

	Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
	pressing it to his wound.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Oh, hello.

	Cutler accesses the situation.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Are you my attorney?
			(extends his hand to Cutler)
		I'm Emil.  I'm insane.

				CUTLER
		I'm not your lawyer until I see the
		money.

				EMIL
		Here.  I have your money.

	Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.  Cutler
	opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. 
	Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
	aside.  Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
	freaking.  He's lost the most important thing in his life.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Oh no!  No!  Shit!

				CUTLER
			(follows Emil - reaching out to
			 him)
		Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit
		down.  What do you need?  What are you
		looking for?

				EMIL
		He has the camera!  He took the movie!

	Jordy comes in, gun raised.

				JORDY
		Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands
		up!  Drop it!

	Emil puts his hands in the air.  Immediately drops the gun!

				EMIL
		I give up!

	Jordy is disappointed!  He didn't want to take Emil alive. 
	Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
	Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head.

				CUTLER
		This man is unarmed, officer.  He's
		surrendered.

	Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		What are you hitting him for?

				JORDY
		Turn that camera off!

	Jordy handcuffs him.  Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
	appearing more hurt than he is.

				EMIL
		No.  Keep filming...

	Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
	that moment why he's surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up -
	dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
	favoring his ankle.

				CUTLER
			(to Emil)
		Don't say anything.

				EMIL
		Where are we going?

				CUTLER
		I'm coming with you.

				EMIL
		Yes.  Yes, come with me!

				CUTLER
			(to Jordy)
		I'm invoking rights - this man is
		represented by counsel.  I'm coming with
		him.

	The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything. 
	Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he's in the video
	footage.

				JORDY
		Turn that camera off!

	EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

	As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. 
	Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
	to his car.  Leon grabs Emil.

				LEON
		I'll take him.

				JORDY
		No way!  He's mine!

				LEON
			(holding on to Emil, squeezing
			 his arm hard)
		We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

				JORDY
		He's my collar!

				LEON
		Well, he killed my partner!

				JORDY
		He's yours but I take him in!  I'll
		drive him to the precinct, you can have
		him but I'm walkin' him in.

	Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
	custody.

				LEON
		Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll
		follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him!

	Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are
		goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile
		when they put you down!

	Cutler hurries to Emil's side.

				CUTLER
		Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his
		taunting!
			(to Leon)
		He's represented by counsel.  You want
		to speak to someone - you speak to me!

				TOMMY
		Out of the way, counselor.

	Tommy shoves Cutler aside.

				CUTLER
		Don't you put your hands on me,
		Detective.

	Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon
	turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.

				LEON
		And you, you'll pay for what you did!

				HAWKINS
			(low)
		This footage will work in your favor. 
		When the jury sees this - no matter what
		Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

	Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.

				LEON
		You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of
		yourself.

				HAWKINS
		If I didn't put it on somebody else
		would!  I was his friend!

				LEON
		Don't give me that fucking shit.

	The cameras are rolling.

				MURPHY
		Don't get into it on TV.

				LEON
			(yells to other cop cars)
		Alright, let's get going!

	Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already
	behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
	seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away.
		
	INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT

	Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the
	lights.

				TOMMY
		What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose
		everybody!

	Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
	Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
	lane - having lost the police.

				TOMMY (CONT'D)
		Where are you goin'??  This ain't the
		way to the station!

	Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.

	EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy pulls off on 130th Street.  They are way uptown in the
	middle of nowhere.  The car drives down a dark street.  
	Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
	no people around.

	EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The car slows down.  Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's
	going on.  Jordy stops at a dead end.  Pulls open the back
	door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
	deserted tunnel.

				TOMMY
		Jordy...??? Listen to me.  You can't do
		this.  This isn't the way to do things.

	Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.

				JORDY
		Were you a fireman?  That how you knew
		how to rig the apartment?

				EMIL
		My father was.  He gave me many lessons
		about fire.  Now it's my friend.

				JORDY
		Tommy, take a walk.

				TOMMY
		What are you gonna do?

				JORDY
		Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna
		get caught!  That's why he videotaped
		Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna
		get off.

				TOMMY
		Don't stoop to his level!

	Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.

				JORDY
		Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

				TOMMY
		Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

				JORDY
			(erupting)
		GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR
		AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
		KILL YOU, TOO!!!

	Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car.  Climbs behind
	the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
	the darkness.  Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol.  The one Emil
	took from Eddie.  Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
	left.  Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in
	Emil's belt.  He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
	center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and
	throws them aside.  Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
	around to face him.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Get your hands up!  Get your hands up!

	Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
	same place he put Emil's.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You wanna be a real American?  Go for
		your gun.

	Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for
	the gun.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Pull the gun!  You want to be famous? 
		Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and
		make more money.

	Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.

				EMIL
		You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. 
		Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you
		never shot anybody in your life.

				JORDY
		You'll be my first.

	Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
	Emil's eyes.

				EMIL
		C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh,
		look, you're sweating.  You don't have
		the balls.

				JORDY
		Get down on your knees.

	Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech.  SIRENS
	fill the air.  Police cars come flying down the street.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Where's your partner?

				EMIL
		The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. 
		Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

	Leon runs up.  Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill
	Emil.

				LEON
		Gimme your gun, Jordy.  We all want him
		dead but you can't do it this way.

	Emil is still smiling.  Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
	face.  Knocking him to the floor.  He jumps in his car and
	speeds away.
		
		INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of
	Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg's room.  Jordy
	follows behind him - gun aimed at his back.

				WAITER
		Do you really need me?

				JORDY
		Keep your mouth shut.  Don't mess this
		up.

	They reach the room.  Jordy flattens himself against the
	wall.  The waiter KNOCKS.

				HOOKER'S VOICE
		Who's there?

				WAITER
			(nervous)
		R-room service.

	A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
	out at the waiter.

				HOOKER
		Come in.

	Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
	the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom
	door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the
	bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He's hooked
	up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
	footage of the fire.

				OLEG
		Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. 
		No cuts.
			(excited)
		And look.  Look at that transition. 
		That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?!

	Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.

				JORDY
		Don't move!

	Oleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and
	picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of
	the hookers for protection.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Drop the girl!  Drop her!!

	Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into
	the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes
	out into the

	HOTEL HALLWAY

	Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down
	the stairwell.

	EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

	Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs
	through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases
	him, gun in hand!

	Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic,
	cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. 
	Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. 
	Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his
	underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He's holding
	the camera in his hand.  It's on.

				JORDY
		STOP!  STOP THAT MAN!

	A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking
	him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into:

	INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door.

				TICKET TAKER
		Hey, come back here!

	The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy
	counter.  Jordy rushes in the door.

				JORDY
		Where is he?  Where'd he go?

				TICKET TAKER
		Middle door.

	Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle
	door - and enters the theater through the far door.

	INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

	Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It's a
	night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. 
	He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle.

				DRUNK'S VOICE
		Kill him!  Kill the bastard!

	Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.  Others start
	YELLING for blood!

				AUDIENCE
		Shoot him!  SHOOT!

	A GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes
	the shots are coming from the screen.

				OLEG
		Look!  Over here!

	Jordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
	film Jordy's death with a videocamera. 
	Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
	the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
	and heads, bounding for the screen.

				JORDY
		Everybody down!  Stay DOWN!

	Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the
	audience don't realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg
	leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. 
	Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES
	back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a
	clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy
	raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! 
	Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has
	disappeared.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

	SIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as
	they enter.

	CLOSE ON TV

	A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie
	theater.

				REPORTER (ON T.V.)
		...and the wild chase through Times
		Square ended with the suspect, Oleg
		Razgul, escaping.  The fire department
		has identified the fire marshal involved
		in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.

	The channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same
	story.

				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
		In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's
		attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for
		handling sensational cases - claims his
		client is unfit to stand trial.

	INT. JAIL CELL - WIDER - DAY

	Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell.  Watching TV
	through the bars.  She is in the fire department's holding
	cell in Brooklyn.

				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
		In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
		not the alleged mastermind behind the
		murders. 
		According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was
		being directed by his partner, who
		threatened to kill him if he didn't
		follow Mr. Razgul's orders.  Cutler told
		reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in
		fact stab his client.

	The scene CUTS TO Cutler's press conference.

				CUTLER
		My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. 
		What's happened is not his fault.  Emil
		was under the influence of his partner. 
		At the trial, you'll see that my client
		will be vindicated...

	INT. BELLEVUE - MENTAL OBSERVATION UNIT - DAY

	The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set.  We are now in an
	interview room, a guard is posted outside the room.  Emil
	sits at a small table - with Cutler.  Emil is dressed in
	Bellevue clothes.  He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. 
	Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler.

				CUTLER
		I brought you some letters.  It's really
		fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to
		buy you clothes, another sent a check. 
		Another wants a check.

				EMIL
		You bring the cigarettes?

				CUTLER
		Oh, sure.

	Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in
	Emil's mouth and lights it for him.  Emil has never smoked
	before.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		How're they treating you, alright
			(Emil is nonresponsive)
		I want to get the cuffs off... but
		there's a little bit of a problem. 
		Things out there are very negative right
		now for us.  We gotta change that
		around.  Perception is very, very
		important.  Perception is reality.  I
		know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's
		important that I get that message out. 
		Cause that's our only defense in this
		case.

	Emil leans forward.  Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
	between his lips.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		I want you to focus on three things:
		fear...

	He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		...delusions and paranoia.

				EMIL
		I was all of these.

				CUTLER
		Well, you didn't appreciate the severity
		of it until recently.  No question about
		that.

				EMIL
		What about Oleg?

				CUTLER
		Disappeared.  They're looking
		everywhere.  Maybe he went back to
		Czechoslovakia.

				EMIL
		No, he is here.  Shit...

				CUTLER
		Don't worry about him.  Think about
		yourself.

				EMIL
		What about my movie rights?  Book
		rights?

				CUTLER
		Look, I haven't really focused on that
		kind of thing.

				EMIL
		What's your cut?  How much?

				CUTLER
		I would say...half.  Half is fair.

				EMIL
			(laughs)
		No.  No way.

				CUTLER
		But it's...

				EMIL
		Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call
		another lawyer.  This is the biggest
		case of your life.  Don't try to
		negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or
		no.

				CUTLER
		This is not about money, Emil.  I need
		your trust in me.

				EMIL
		What else do you need?

				CUTLER
		I need to know about your background.  I
		need to know about your upbringing.  Why
		you're here.

				EMIL
			(indicating cigarette)
		Give me another one, please.

	Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth.  Lights it.

				CUTLER
		Tell me about yourself.  What you did as
		a young boy... what your parents were
		like.

				EMIL
		My father always degraded me.  Killed my
		self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

				CUTLER
		Your mother was blind?

				EMIL
		Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. 
		She went to fucking black market doctor
		to induce me.

				CUTLER
		Back in the Czech Republic?

				EMIL
		Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
		drugs which made her go blind.  And my
		father blamed me for her blindness...

				CUTLER
		Your father blamed you for your mother's
		blindness?

				EMIL
		Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
		born.  Put it out.  Can you put the
		cigarette out?

	Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes
	it.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		That's what he did to me.  He put
		cigarettes out on me.

				CUTLER
		Your father put cigarettes out on you?

				EMIL
		Out on my back when I was a small boy.

				CUTLER
		Can I see your back?

	Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS
	ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
	CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		Oh, Jesus.

				EMIL
		I'm abused.  Don't you think?

				CUTLER
		I don't think it's abuse, I think it's
		torture.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy
	stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can
	see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a
	subpoena in his hand.

				DUFFY
		The public doesn't have any idea what we
		do and now you're going to define our
		image!  This is going to be our Rodney
		King!

				JORDY
		What was I supposed to do?  The guy
		tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop
		back - I just forgot.

				DUFFY
		Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a
		tree?!

				JORDY
		Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
		guy was no innocent civilian.

				DUFFY
		Well this is gonna end your career and
		probably mine.

				JORDY
		End my career?

				DUFFY
		How are you going to fight this?  Maybe
		if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd
		been on the front page, as a hero, this
		thing would be easier to fight.  You'd
		have the good to weight against the bad! 
		It's unfortunate that I have to make
		decisions based upon your press coverage
		but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme
		your shield.

				JORDY
		But Chief?  Over this??

				DUFFY
		There's nothing to talk about.  Get a
		good lawyer.  You're suspended until
		your trial.

	Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops
	his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun
	- looks at it.

				DUFFY (CONT'D)
			(pats Jordy's shoulder)
		I know you got backup at home.  Drop it
		off.

	Jordy sighs and exits.

	INT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY

	Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In
	another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
	U.S. ATTORNEYS.

				STERN
			(to Jordy)
		Look, what don't you understand?  We've
		got a good relationship with the Czech's
		and the State Department doesn't want to
		cause an incident.

				JORDY
		But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!

				STERN
		They've got her testimony on videotape. 
		And even if they do take her to court
		immediately after she'll be extradited. 
		The Czechs want her back.  She shot a
		cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
		Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
		Republic?  How would you feel if the
		Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!

	Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers
	his voice.

				STERN (CONT'D)
		And just between us...I was married to a
		redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are
		like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from
		both.

	Jordy gives him a look.

				STERN (CONT'D)
		You want to see her - go ahead.

	Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The
	assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.

				JORDY
		We're gonna fight the extradition.

	Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.

				DAPHNE
		Forget about me.  You have enough
		problems of your own.

				JORDY
		...Do you really want me to forget about
		you?

				DAPHNE
		I don't want to drag you down with me.

				JORDY
		Daphne, I...

	Daphne touches her finger to his lips.

				DAPHNE
		Shhhh.

	She leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes,
	trying to find a smile.

	EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY

	It's weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
	frazzled.  She's trying to go through her stand up.  But
	she's unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.

				NICOLETTE 
		...and today with his partner who he
		blamed for the crimes still at large,
		Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His
		lawyer will argue that he is mentally 
		unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News
		has also learned that later this month,
		Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing
		in court.  He will be arraigned on
		charges of violating the civil rights
		of...Zwangen...Zwagen...

				MIKE
		Zwangendaba.

				NICOLETTE
		Goddamn assholes everywhere. 
		Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. 
		I'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again. 
		5-4-3-2-1...

	She starts over.

	INT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jordy's on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with
	his dog, ZACK.  Jordy's eyes are glazed.  He's drunk, his
	eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or
	Daphne. 
	His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. 
	As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
	seeps through her broadcast.

				NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
		Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
		descendent of the African King from whom
		he takes his name...

	Jordy's face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy
	picks up.

				JORDY
		Hello?
			(listens)
		No comment.

	He hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Hello?
			(listens)
		No!

	Jordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert
	Hawkins' face fills the screen.  He is standing across from
	someone - in a park - interviewing him.

				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
		He robbed you?

	The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
	suit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He
	stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
	tree.  He's appearing on "Top Story".

				ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
		That's right, I encountered him right
		here.  I was just askin' for change an'
		he whips out his big gun an' pushes me
		up against that tree, whereupon he takes
		my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'
		me there all exposed...

	The phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
	the table and throws it through the window:

	BACK TO TV

	as the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him
	is a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. 
	The reporter stands in front of the jail.

				REPORTER
		...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
		won't have to worry about how he is
		going to pay for his defense.  He has
		received movie offers and been in

		concerning the rights to his life story.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Oleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy.


	INT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

	Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see
	the TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He
	stares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head.

	EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

	Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the
	park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. 
	Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
	Rykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
	and sticks it in his pocket.

	CLOSE ON METER

	to $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.

				TAXI DRIVER
		I can't believe this guy got off. 
		Unbelievable.

	Jordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he
	crams it into the slot.

				JORDY
		Whatever's leftover, keep.

	Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is
	coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is
	sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with
	rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up
	and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand
	grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.

	HIGH WIDE SHOT

	Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. 
	All are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:

	HAWKINS

	and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
	frazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she
	looks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a
	disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -
	anxious - looks at his cameraman.

				HAWKINS
		He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he
		comes through the crowd.  Do you hear
		me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.

	THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP

	Cutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
	the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
	car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
	POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at
	Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:

				CUTLER
		...my client was suffering from a major
		illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
		during times of intense stress, as a
		result of paranoid and psychotic
		delusions - there was impairment of his
		ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
		This is a victory for the mentally ill!

	Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on
	Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,
	the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? 
	Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam
	in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
	cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
	place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler
	continues:

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		...before Emil boards the police boat
		and heads for Rykers Island where he
		will be checked into the psyche ward, I
		want to say one last word to you all...
		As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
		Razgul into committing these murders,
		yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
		free man, filming gruesome murders... My
		client and I hope he is brought to
		justice in the near future.

	They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
	Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch
	obsessively.

				HAWKINS
		Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!

	Jordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. 
	Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts.

				JORDY
		You think this is funny??  What the hell
		are you laughing at?

	Emil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the
	jacket.

				CUTLER
			(to a nearby escort)
		Officer, keep this man back, he's
		assaulted my client on previous
		occasions.

	A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.

				JORDY
		This is it?  This bastard kills the best
		cop this city ever had and we do
		nothing?

				CUTLER
		You may not like it marshal, but that's
		the law.

				JORDY
		And what about the other victims??  What
		about their families?  He'll end up in
		some country club nuthouse while his
		lawyer sells his rights to the movies
		and we just stand here and do nothing? 
		We let this scumbag walk?

	Jordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. 
	Gets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly.

				EMIL
		Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm
		insane.

	Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the
	cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:

	A VIDEO POV

	as it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame
	tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who
	he's been waiting for.  His face lights up.

				HAWKINS
		I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where
		is it?  Where is the tape?

	IT'S OLEG

	In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.

				OLEG
		It's all in here.  All in here.

	MEANWHILE JORDY

	has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice
	cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:

				HAWKINS
		Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some
		interesting evidence, something you
		should look at!

	Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he
	continues introducing his broadcast:

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
		UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
		proving Emil Slovak was not insane! 
		Hard to believe...watch!

	Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
	videocamera up in the air.

				OLEG (ON VIDEO)
		He knew exactly what he was doing - all
		of this was planned!  It's all here in
		my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. 
		Look!

	Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
	of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:

				EMIL (ON VIDEO)
		...so we kill someone famous and if we
		are caught, we are sent to mental
		hospital...

				CUTLER
			(points to Oleg)
		Officers, there's your killer, do your
		duty, arrest him!

	The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
	reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the
	press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy
	notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE
	CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
	killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He
	yells at Oleg!

				EMIL
		Traitor!!

				OLEG
		No.  You are the traitor.  You are
		murderer.  I am director.  Action!

	Oleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:

	BANG!

	Oleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings
	his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. 
	Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
	escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He
	swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are
	screaming.  It's CHAOS.

	Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. 
	He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
	her head.

				CAPTAIN
		Drop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!

				EMIL
		I'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back
		away from me!

	We hear Jordy's voice above Emil.

				JORDY
		Let her go.  Let her fucking go!!

	The captain is screaming at all his men.

				CAPTAIN
		No one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do
		not fire!  No officer will fire his
		weapon unless I say so!
			(to Emil)
		Let the woman go!

	Cops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still
	aiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn't
	lowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.

				CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
		Holster your weapons!  Back away.  That
		is an order!  No officers will fire!

	Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
	Emil.

				EMIL
		Tell him to put his gun down!

				JORDY
		Let her go!  Let her go!!

				EMIL
		If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking
		kill her.

	Jordy doesn't lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The
	reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
	their lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! 
	Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.

				JORDY
		Let her go.

				NICOLETTE
		Shoot!  Shoot him!!

				EMIL
		Shut up!

	Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:

				CAPTAIN
		No on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer
		will follow.  No officer will shoot!

	Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.

				NICOLETTE
		Shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!

				EMIL
		Shut up!

	Everyone is screaming at once.  It's mass chaos.  The captain
	is trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with
	their weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still
	pointed at Emil. 
	Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.  He's
	pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to
	get the best coverage.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he
		lowers his gun.

	He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away
	towards the police boat.

				NICOLETTE
		Don't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot
		him!

	Jordy won't take his gun off him.

				JORDY
		Let her go.  Let her go.

	The captain is yelling at Jordy.

				CAPTAIN
		Lower your weapon.  I told you - lower
		your weapon!

	Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can't.  His
	heart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his
	weapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil
	laughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his
	weapon.

	JORDY SHOOTS

	Emil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the
	handcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
	he shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the
	shoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's
	chest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
	Emil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the
	ground.  Dead.  The captain yells.

				CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
		I told you not to shoot!  No officers
		should shoot.

	Jordy quietly answers:

				JORDY
		I'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.

				HAWKINS
		He's still alive.

	Hawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. 
	His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.

	OLEG'S VIDEO POV

	as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He
	looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:

				OLEG
		A film...by Oleg Razgul.

	And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins
	jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		How was that?

	Oleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs
	over to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad
	Emil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.

				NICOLETTE
		Wait a minute.  Where are you going? 
		Learn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of
		public opinion.  Take the credit, you
		need it.

	She turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push
	the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.

				JORDY
		No thanks.

	Jordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's
	EDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. 
	She looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens
	pointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. 
	He doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want
	the fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because
	he was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.

				NICOLETTE
		Cut.

	Her cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. 
	Jordy turns and walks away.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Get a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to
		me.

	Jordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS
	back to Nicolette.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you
		saw it.

	The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is
	now on:

	THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE

	We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.  Nicolette finishing her
	stand up:

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		New York City has a new hero, Fire
		Marshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire
		Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this
		afternoon will help with his other legal
		problems.  WB11 has also learned that
		the fire Marshal has retained an
		immigration lawyer to help Daphne
		Handlova with her case.  We wish her
		well.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at
		Battery Park, WB11 New York.  Good
		night.

	THE SCREEN

						 FADES TO BLACK.
FADE IN

	on the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words
	on the side of the plane.

	INT. AIRPLANE

	ANGLE DOWN

	on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
	Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
	the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
	pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
	to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
	The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
	him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
	small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport
	is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in
	CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

				EMIL (V.O.)
		Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I
		say.  Don't open your mouth.

				OLEG (V.O.)
		Okay.

	INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

	CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are
	split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
	visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An
	unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. 
	Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His
	eyes are alert, cunning and smart.

	OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not
	tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. 
	(The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)

				EMIL
		Don't fool around.

				OLEG
		Okay.

	Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
	take a picture of himself.

				EMIL
		Did you hear what I said?

				OLEG
		I want to document my trip to America.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Next.
			(Emil steps up)
		Could I see your documents, please?

				EMIL
		Yes sir.

	He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
	image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What is your intended purpose of your
		visit to the United States?

				EMIL
		Two weeks holiday.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		How much money are you carrying with
		you?

				EMIL
		I have five-hundred dollars.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the
		FIS area!

	Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
	Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
			(to Emil)
		Is he with you?  Are you travelling
		together?

				EMIL
		Yes.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Please join us.
			(to Oleg)
		Come on forward.

				EMIL
		Is there a problem?

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		No, you're travelling together.  I want
		to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
		you?  Can I take a look at your
		documents?
			(takes Oleg's passport)
		Are you related?

				OLEG
		Yes...he's my friend.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Okay.  You're a Czech national and
		you're a Russian national.  How do you
		know one another?

	Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.

				EMIL
		We are both from Prague.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		How long are you planning to stay?

				EMIL
		Two weeks.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

				EMIL
		He doesn't speak English.

				OLEG
		I speak English.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		Then answer my questions.  Where were
		you planning to stay during the two
		weeks that you're here?

				OLEG
		New York.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Yes, we're in New York now.  But where
		are you planning to stay in New York?

				OLEG
		A cheap hotel.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What are you coming here to do?

				OLEG
		I'm here for movies.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Movies...to be in the movies or to see
		movies?

				OLEG
		Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I
		see movie at school called "It's a
		Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. 
		Ever since I want to come to America. 
		Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A
		land where anyone can be anything. As
		long as they are white.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Excuse me?

				EMIL
		He made joke, bad joke.  First time on
		airplane...

	The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Well, they've got valid visas, but they
		don't have much money.  Uh... and I'm
		not...uh, I think there's a possibility
		they may be coming to live and reside.

				SUPERVISOR
		Look how long the line is.  We gotta
		move 'em out.  I'll take them down to
		secondary.

	Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
	bar.  EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
	his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. 
	Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.  Not only
	is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
	he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
	the subject of several magazine articles.  There's even been
	a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.  Leon has been
	with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.

	Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
	reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story."  Hawkins is also
	the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
	Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

	Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. 
	Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war
	story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.

				EDDIE
		So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
		we got Emergency Service with the heavy
		weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I
		say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
		go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the
		sudden I turn around and a kid with a
		shotgun let one go.  Right where I was
		standin'.  That coulda been it.  I
		coulda had my head blown off and for
		what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,
		takes the safety off and it's over.  If
		I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
		a bad habit - I would've had my head
		blown off.

				HAWKINS
		Jesus Christ.

	PAULIE, the owner, walks up.

				PAULIE
		Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?

				HAWKINS
		Another martini.

				LEON
		Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

				EDDIE
		Vodka tonic.

				LEON
			(rethinks it)
		Maybe you could just put in a shot of
		Martell?

	Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
	vodka.

				LEON (CONT'D)
			(of Eddie's story)
		It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid
		kid.

				EDDIE
		What's the kid gonna say - sorry? 
		Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. 
		Like last week - we were at the morgue
		and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
		here - liver there - his heart in a pan. 
		Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
		dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who
		knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3
		or some shit and shot him and now you
		can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
		human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. 
		Sooner or later.  That's me.  

				HAWKINS
		Sooner or later that's everybody.  

				EDDIE
		Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like
		that.  I mean, what do I got left? 
		Coupla articles.  A medal or two. 
		Plaque here and there and in a coupla
		years no one remembers me anymore.

				HAWKINS
		I think you're getting a little moody
		there, Eddie.

				EDDIE
		I'm not moody.

	Hawkins and Leon share a look.

				HAWKINS
		Isn't he a little moody?

				LEON
		Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in
		love.

				HAWKINS
		In love?  With who?

	Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. 
	Takes a seat next to Eddie.  Eddie asks Hawkins.

				EDDIE
		How old are your kids?

				HAWKINS
		My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. 
		Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're
		thinking about having a kid!  How old
		are you?  Never mind. 
		Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
		cliche you hear about kids - they change
		your life, they make you a better
		person, they make you whole...
			(beat)
		It's all true!  Before I had kids when
		friends talked about their kids, I
		wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I
		right, Leon?

				LEON
		Absomotherfuckin'lutely.  You can have
		all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody
		so much as looks sideways at my four
		girls -- I'd kill 'em.  
			(takes out his wallet)
		You haven't seen my youngest have you?

	As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Yeah?

				HAWKINS
		Paulie, you've got kids, right?

				PAULIE
		My kids don't talk to me anymore but
		they were great when they were young.

				LEON
			(into the phone)
		Sure it's him?  Great!
			(collapses the phone)
		Unique's home.

	They all rise from the table.

				EDDIE
		Paulie, I need the cure.

				PAULIE
		Step into my office.

	Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.

				HAWKINS
		So you got your kids listening to Opera? 
		You still singing in the church on the
		weekends?

	INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

	Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've
	been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I
		understand that.
			(to Emil)
		And what kind of work do you do?

				EMIL
		I am butcher.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		You're a butcher?  What do you use pig
		intestines for?

				EMIL
		You stuff sausage in it.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		And what do you do with the bones?

				EMIL
		Dog food.

	Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
	Control for their detainment.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Are you married?

				EMIL
		No.  Are you proposing?

	ANGLE UP

	through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us...

	INT. MENS ROOM

	Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
	full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
	eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.

				EDDIE
		Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? 
		What are you doin' Saturday?

	Leon enters.  Eddie turns.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I'm gonna propose.

				LEON
		When?

				EDDIE
		Tomorrow.  At lunch.

				LEON
		You ready?

	Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns.

				EDDIE
		The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

	Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
	action.  Each stands with an old suitcase.

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the
		movies!

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Don't speak Russian!

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Why?  Why do I always have to speak to
		you in Czech?

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Because I don't like your ugly language. 
		I heard enough of it in school!  Now
		speak Czech or English.  And don't fool
		around anymore.  You almost got us
		thrown out!

	Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This
	is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring
	inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A
	videocamera's pointed out in the street.

				OLEG
		Look.  New videocameras.  Color
		viewfinder.  Image stabilization. 
		Solarization.  Night vision.

				EMIL
		We have no money.  Come on.

	Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. 
	Emil slides into the cab.

				CABBIE
		Where you wanna go, buddy?

	Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the
	return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
	Cabbie.

				EMIL
		Here.

	Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg
	hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
	coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut 
	and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling
	out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Go!

	Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
		

	EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY

	Eddie's car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.

				HAWKINS
		So what's unique?

				EDDIE
		Not what.  Who.

	Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
	covered in blood.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was
		taking too long to put her make-up on. 
		they were late for a party.  Stabbed her
		with a beer bottle.

				HAWKINS
		That's unique.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

	Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.

				LOOKOUT
		Top floor.  Back room.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the
		news and I look good.  But the problem
		with becoming a star is downtown.  They
		shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

	As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. 
	Waves them off.  They hurry away.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees
		are killing me.  Stay behind me.

				HAWKINS
		You're worried for my safety.  I'm
		touched.

	Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
	the fire escape.

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		Ready?

				EDDIE
		Keep them out of my way.

				HAWKINS
		Okay.  You ready?

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

	Eddie closes in.

				HAWKINS
			(into his cell phone)
		COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,
		LET'S MOVE IT!

	Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
	the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
	the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where
	he lands dropping his gun.

	Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.

				EDDIE
		What's your rush?  Going to a party?

				UNIQUE
		Why you chasin' me, man?

				EDDIE
		I don't know.  You always come outta
		your house that way?

				UNIQUE
		It's not my house, man.  I don't live
		here.

				EDDIE
		Well, sounds like burglary to me.

	Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.

				UNIQUE
		I know you man.

	An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a
	mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.

				HAWKINS
			(to Eddie)
		Any chance we can do that again?

				EDDIE
		Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first
		time.
						

	EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY

	The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg
	gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
	into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks
	back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.

				EMIL
		Turn that off!  Get the bags.

				OLEG
		Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a
		dog.

				EMIL
		For five years I paid for your
		stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
		rest of my life if I say so.
			(challenging)
		Unless you refuse, Oleg.

	Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
	he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the
	occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		There.  5RW.

	Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks
	and Emil pushes it open.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY

	The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
	stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack
	pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl.

				OLEG
		What?

				EMIL
		Smell like chemicals...for smoking
		drugs.

	Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
	down the dirty hallway to a corner door.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS -
	a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. 
	He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg
	films him...

				MILOS
		Emil???!

				EMIL
		Surprise!  Surprise!

	Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
	comely wife.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears
	plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina
	has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
	apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
	bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with
	kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is
	a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The
	following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)

				EMIL
		Your sister said she didn't know where
		you were so you shouldn't write to her
		with return address if you're hiding. 

				MILOS
		Did you hurt her?

				EMIL
		You know me...I never hurt anybody. 
		Where's the money?

				OLEG
		Hello, Tamina.

	Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks
	at Oleg.

				MILOS
		Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
			(to Emil)
		Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were
		caught.
			(of Oleg)
		It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank
		clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going
		to wait!!!

				EMIL
		Milos.  Get my money!

	Oleg videotapes the scene.

	CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR

	All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
	obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
	around her.

				MILOS
			(nervously)
		We spent it!

				EMIL
		Ha. Ha.

				MILOS
		Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. 
		You think I'd be working if I had
		money?!

	Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
	KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
	throat.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		Emil.  Put down the knife.

	Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		Emil.  I'll help you.

	Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
	him by talking softly.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		I can get you a job.

				EMIL
		A job?

				MILOS
		Yes, the money is good.

				EMIL
		As a plumber?!

				MILOS
		It's easy to learn.

				EMIL
		A job??  As a plumber???  You think I
		come to America to work!

				MILOS
		We started over, you can too.

				EMIL
			(furious)
		You spent all the money while I was in
		prison?  Now you tell me to get a job
		fixing toilets?!?

	Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
	it toward Milos' chest!

	Oleg videotapes it.  Then lowers the camera - shocked that
	Emil killed Milos.

	Blood sprays Tamina's face.  She tries to run but Oleg grabs
	her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
	floor.  He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
	Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!

	THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR

	flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. 
	Emil kicks the bedroom door open.  Sees the window leading to
	the fire escape.  He dashes to it.  Sees four flights down -
	the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.  Barefoot.  Her hair still
	wet.  

	She looks up.  She is beautiful and terrified.  She runs
	down the alley.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		She saw!

	Emil hurries toward the bathroom.  She just got out of the
	shower.  Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. 
	Emil grabs the purse.  Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.  He
	opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Daphne Hanlova.

	There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
	arrived - June 16, 1998.  Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
	STAY.  Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
	blank pages.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Six month visa.  Still here two years
		later.  They'll deport her if she goes
		to Police.

	Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
	shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
	floor.  He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
	and bottles aside.

				OLEG
		What are you looking for?

	Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.

				EMIL
		I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.

	Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
	darkness.
		
		EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

	A face comes from the darkness.  It's an athletically
	handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.  He's in a
	tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. 
	He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.  A sensitive man of rugged
	honesty.  He runs down the hill in a hurry.  A MUGGER steps
	in his path.

				MUGGER
		Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare
		twenty?

				JORDY
		Look, I don't have time for you, get out
		of my way!!

				MUGGER
		Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
		money?

	The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
	grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
	manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
	behind his back.  With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
	BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
	the mugger's head.  Jordy displays his shield.

				JORDY
		Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you
		happy?

				MUGGER
		Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry
		guns.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah?  Guess again.

	Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
	pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
	credit cards.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Nice - how many people you ripped off
		tonight?!  Get up!

	As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You couldn't listen to me, could you?

	Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.  Cuffs him so his face is
	pressed up against the bark.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I'll send a cop back for you.

				MUGGER
		Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like
		this.  Some freak'll come by and stab
		me!

	Jordy jogs off across the park.

				MUGGER (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Come back!!

	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.  Radios CRACKLE.  There's
	a crowd growing.  Jordy pushes his way through.  The top
	floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
	reduced to smoking ruins.  The trees are covered in debris
	and soot.  Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.

				LOUIE
		Lieutenant - take up your line and
		relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
		floor.

				JORDY
		Hey, Louie, were you first due?

				LOUIE
		Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
		'cause you got two roasts on the top
		floor but you don't hafta investigate
		cause homicide is up there.

				JORDY
		Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't
		make it a crime scene yet.

				LOUIE
		Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.

				KORFIN (O.S.)
		Yo, Jordy!

	BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
	with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
	turnout coat.

				KORFIN (CONT'D)
		Where you been, man?  We got a
		celebrity!

				JORDY
		I heard.  Who the hell let them up
		there?

				KORFIN
		I don't know, you think Eddie will give
		me his autograph?

				JORDY
		You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody
		suspicious?

				KORFIN
		Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah, why?

				KORFIN
		'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
		now!

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,
	smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by
	what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
	charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
	listening to Leon.

				LEON
		So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
		position - that they were doin' each
		other but were so whacked out of their
		heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
		lit it up, and they got fried.  What do
		you think, Eddie?

	Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.

				EDDIE
		I don't know.  We got the experts here. 
		Show them what you found - I hope you
		don't mind, we came over to see if we
		could help.

	Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
	celebrity.

				KORFIN
		Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -
		Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
		you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

				JORDY
		Could you put out the cigar?  Part of
		the job is picking up scents.

				EDDIE
		Oh, sure.

	Eddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar
	holder and pockets it to finish later.

				LEON
		Well, I found - check it out - crack
		pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

	Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin
	shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

				KORFIN
		Sorry, bro.

				JORDY
		Hey, that's great you guys got it all
		wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
		through the routine?  It gives us
		somethin' to do.

				EDDIE
		No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

				LEON
		No.  Go ahead.

				JORDY
		Thanks.  Appreciate it.

	Jordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no
	respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie
	rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
	living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
	charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.

				KORFIN
		Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
		good patterns - about thirty minutes
		old.

	Jordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white
	rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The
	glove comes out white.

				JORDY
		Mouth's clean, too.

				KORFIN
		Clean?

				JORDY
		Don't blow your nose!

	Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
		burn 'em out.  Let it run.

				KORFIN
		But you knew that, right?

	Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy
	turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other
	room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.

				JORDY
		So the way you see it, two crack heads
		burned themselves up?

				LEON
		That's what it looks like to me.

				JORDY
		And while they're burning up, they're
		still goin' down on each other?  You got
		to hand it to them.

				LEON
			(realizes he's wrong - blows it
			 off)
		Yeah, well, some people got their
		priorities straight.

	Leon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
	pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
	heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth
	inside.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		What was that?

				JORDY
		Evidence.  Of a homicide.

	That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You know what that is, right?

				EDDIE
		No, what is it?

				JORDY
		Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
			(to a fireman joking a wall)
		Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole
		in the floor?

				CAMELLO
		No problem.
			(to Eddie and Leon)
		Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna
		back up a little more.  Don't wanna get
		your pants wet.

	Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
	set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello
	hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
	bodies and Korfin explains:

				KORFIN
		They have not soot in their mouths,
		which means they weren't breathin'
		before the fire and that usually means
		they were deceased - and this piece of
		cloth that my partner found means they
		were wrapped up in something, probably
		doused with a flammable liquid and
		positioned like this on the bed.  To the
		untrained eye, it looks like an
		accident.

	Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
	something.

				LEON
		What's he looking for?

				EDDIE
		A timer.

	Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
	on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from
	Jordy and moves to Eddie.

				KORFIN
		Here you go.  A big double homicide.

	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
	arriving.  Jumps out. 
	Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.  They open the
	trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.

				KORFIN
		You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
		timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

				JORDY
		He knew all along.

				KORFIN
		What??

				JORDY
		That's why he was so quiet.  He was
		testing us.

	Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
	inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
	microphone at Eddie.  She's smart, aggressive and respected
	by her peers.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective, does it look like a murder?

				EDDIE
		We don't know that yet.  It's much too
		early.  There's a lot to be done.

				NICOLETTE
		How many victims are up there?

				EDDIE
		There are two bodies found at this
		point.

				NICOLETTE
		Can we go up to the crime scene?

				EDDIE
		You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

				NICOLETTE
		Is it drug related?

				EDDIE
		We don't know.  When I have more I'll
		let you know.

	Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
	Eddie's hand.  She barrels on...

				NICOLETTE
		Detective...what's that you're holding
		in your hand?  Evidence?

	Mike pans up to Eddie's face.  Other reporters arrive,
	hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash
	as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in
	the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
	HANDLOVA.  She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress. 
	She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a
	glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the
	crowd - but Daphne is gone.

				KORFIN
		What?

				JORDY
		There was a woman - I think she wanted
		to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
		shit!  Oh no!

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER

	Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. 
	Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
	now NAKED!

				MUGGER
		You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped
		me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me
		all over, it was disgusting.

	Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.

				JORDY
		I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

	Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You okay?

				MUGGER
		A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you
		for this!  You violated my civil rights!

				JORDY
		Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob
		me!  I could arrest you right now! 
		You're lucky you're walking away from
		this.  Now get outta here.

	Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around
	himself cursing - hurrying away.
		

	EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT

	Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
	sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
	the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
	trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down
	twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he
	angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. 
	He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
	behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has
	been talking to a FATHER.

				ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
		So you slept with your son's wife! 
		What's that all about?

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		I take full responsibility for sleepin'
		with my daughter in law.  I had low self
		esteem, I thought I had to compete with
		him.

	Emil reaches for his dictionary.

				EMIL
			(mutters)
		Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

	He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
	esteem.

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		Losin' my job and everything, caused my
		behavioral disorder.
			(turns to his son)
		Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

	The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates...

	Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
	in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
	rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time -
	as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
	between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's
	wearing Milos' Rolex. 
	Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
	earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil
	looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Turn that fucking thing off!

				OLEG
			(Czech)
		I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos
		die.  It's just like a move but realer.

	Emil grabs the videocamera.
			(Czech)
		Don't break it!  Don't break it!

				EMIL
		Speak English!

				OLEG
			(English)
		You said speak Czech!

				EMIL
		How you erase this?

				OLEG
		I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

	Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
	bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the
	camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. 
	Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.

				EMIL
		Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill
		him.
			(noticing)
		What's this?

	Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a
	picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
	ESCORTS - and a number.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Worldly escorts?

	Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
	finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the
	number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the
	background.

				SEXY VOICE
		Hi?

				EMIL
		Hello?

				SEXY VOICE
		Are you looking for companionship?

	Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.

				OLEG
		Whore?

				EMIL
		I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European
		girl?  A Czech girl?

				SEXY VOICE
		Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
		girl.

				EMIL
		I take her.  Send her!

	EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

	Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
	returning.

				JORDY
		Now that you know him, maybe you can get
		extra work in the next movie they make
		about him.

				KORFIN
		Yeah?

				JORDY
		Maybe you can be his stand-in.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

	The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
	the high of fighting a fire.  Korfin and Jordy walk toward
	the TV room.  The TV is on in the background.  We can see
	Nicolette interviewing Eddie.  He holds up the paint can.

				CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
		What the hell is that??  You gave Eddie
		Flemming the evidence?!

	They turn.  DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
	of the arson squad - comes over.  Duffy's tough, Irish and
	very political.

				DUFFY
			(pointing to the TV)
		Who did cause and origin?

				JORDY
		Who do you think, Chief?!

				DUFFY
		Then why didn't you talk to the
		reporter?

				JORDY
		'Cause we got more important things to
		do, like finding out who did it.

	They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.

				DUFFY
		Don't you guys understand?  It's all
		about image.  The better we look the
		more money I get to pay you guys
		overtime.

				KORFIN
		Yeah, right.

				DUFFY
		What was that, Korfin?

				KORFIN
		I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As
		soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
		alert the media.

				DUFFY
		You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve
		this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

	They all head upstairs.

	INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter.  There are posters of
	pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls.  GARCIA - a
	Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.

				GARCIA
		Hey guys, I got your torch.  He just
		gave a full confession.

	A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
	turns.  He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly
	scratched cross etched in his forehead.  He craves attention.

				MAX
		It's my fire!  Screw homicide.  I'll
		tell you guys everything!

	Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin.  They sit across from
	each other.  Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
	bothering to stop.

				JORDY
		What's that on your forehead, Max? 
		That's a nice attention getter.

				MAX
		Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist
		like you!  Now, are you guys gonna
		arrest me, or not?

				JORDY
		How did you start the fire this time?

				MAX
		I used an accelerant.

				JORDY
		Yeah?  What kind?

				MAX
			(to Jordy)
		Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about
		your wife leavin' you.

				KORFIN
		Max.

				MAX
			(continuing)
		...Yeah, and with your old man dying
		last year you - what's it?  Just you and
		the dog now?

				KORFIN
		Max!  

				MAX
		Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
		your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a
		big shot downtown.

	Jordy pops out of his seat.

				JORDY
		That's it!  You're outta here.

	Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.

				MAX
		That's it.  I'm suing.

				KORFIN
		Get in line.

	Korfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia
	who is laughing.

				JORDY
		What's so funny.  How does he know so
		much about me?  Who tells him my life
		story?

				GARCIA
		He hangs around downstairs.  The guys
		talk to him.  He's a joke...

				JORDY
		He's no joke!  One day he's gonna
		graduate from trash can fires and do
		something big.

				GARCIA
		Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the
		station.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT

	As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen,
	accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
	America's highest rated 'news magazine' show.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and
		this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you
		an exclusive interview with Stephen
		Geller - who horrified the nation two
		years ago when he went berserk and
		murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
		shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's
		claim, spoken softly and articulately,
		is that he is the victim.  According to
		Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
		day were not his fault but were the
		fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to
		believe...watch.

				EMIL (O.S.)
		Louder.

	VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
	on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Louder.

	Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
	volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
	interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's
	sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
	stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
	background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird
	dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the
	paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.

				STEPHEN GELLER
		This had nothing to do with shoes that
		didn't fit or my relationship with my
		father who, as you know, made a fortune
		selling penny loafers in the fifties. 
		These people died because of the
		criminal actions of my doctor.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Your doctor?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that
		I stay on my medication.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		...so you feel absolutely no
		responsibility for killing these people?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		It was my finger that pulled the
		trigger, but I'm not morally
		responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what
		I was capable of.  How could I know. 
		I'm not a doctor.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		You seem very savvy for a man who's been
		found mentally incompetent to stand
		trial.

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a
		year away from getting my masters in
		Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life
		has been permanently disrupted.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you
		selling paintings now for quite a lot of
		money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you
		call it, jump started your career as an
		artist?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Look, I'm in here.  You call this a
		career move?

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		And isn't there a movie in the works
		about you?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		We're in negotiations, that's correct.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent
		criminals from profiting from their
		crimes?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		That doesn't apply to me because I'm not
		a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I
		wasn't convicted.

	Emil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.

				EMIL
		I love America.  No one is responsible
		for what they do.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
	to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Get in the bathroom!

				OLEG (O.S.)
		Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

				EMIL
		Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
		shut up!

	Emil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom,
	closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks
	down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
	sticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants
	cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
	and opens it.  It's not Daphne and she's not world class.

				HONEY
		Hi, I'm Honey.

				EMIL
		Where's Czech girl?

				HONEY
		Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. 
		I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm
		a Czech girl.

	She enters.  Closes the door behind her.

				HONEY (CONT'D)
		Now I like to get business out of the
		way before we get down to pleasure.  Why
		don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

				EMIL
		I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you
		know her?

	Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey.  During the rest of
	the scene Oleg films her.  Honey begins to undress.

				HONEY
		It's an outcall service run out of an
		apartment.  I don't meet the other
		girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

				EMIL
		Where is escort service?

				HONEY
		That's confidential.  Could you put the
		money on the dresser?

				EMIL
		I like to talk to the person who runs
		the service.  Can you give me address?

				HONEY
		Look.  Do we have a problem here? 
		There's no reason to have a problem. 
		I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You
		wanna Czech girl? 
		After I'm done with you, you won't miss
		her.  Now why don't you pay me?

	She starts to unfasten Emil's belt.

				EMIL
			(stopping her)
		Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just
		give me the address and then you go.

				HONEY
			(suddenly hard as nails)
		Look, man, I don't give a shit if you
		want sex or not, but you're payin' for
		my time.

	Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
	the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
	furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.

				EMIL
		Give me the address!!

				HONEY
		Alright, alright - don't hurt me! 
		Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

	Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
	with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil's face!

	Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame.  He
	WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
	the door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut!  Emil turns blindly,
	rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.  Honey darts
	toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
	Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.  Horrified, she turns around as
	Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
	tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
	her!  Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.  Oleg
	films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...

	THE KITCHEN KNIFE

	As Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. 
	Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around
	her face.  Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN
	INTO:
		
		INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	DAPHNE, a sketch of her face.

				JORDY (O.S.)
		Her lips are fuller than that.  You can
		see 'em a mile away.

	WIDER

	Food containers are scattered all over the place.  The female
	COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy.  Stacks of failed sketches
	sit beside her.

				COMPOSITE ARTIST
		What about her cheek bones?

				JORDY
		Her cheek bones are prominent and her
		eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when
		I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she
		was looking to get away.  But she was
		absolutely beautiful.

	The composite artist looks at Jordy.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I gotta good look at her.

	Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is
	watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the
	landlord of the 7th Street brownstone.  Garcia is also on the
	phone.  The other investigators are gone.  Working late into
	the night.  Everybody's exhausted.  It's almost dawn.

				KORFIN
		-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long
		have they been livin' in your building?  
			(writes 4 YEARS on his pad)
		Alright, I'll be in touch when we know
		somethin'.
			(to Jordy)
		Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were
		quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord
		don't know who your girl is.

				JORDY
		How long they been livin' here?

				KORFIN
		You hear that question, Garcia?

				GARCIA
		Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
		they've been here illegally.

				KORFIN
		Well, they're definitely permanent
		residents now.

				GARCIA
		I got the owner of the plumbing company
		Milos worked for.

				KORFIN
		Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go
		see him in the morning.

				JORDY
		You go home.  I'm takin' your car and
		goin' back to the crime scene.

				KORFIN
		Aren't you tired?

				JORDY
		If I go home I won't be able to fall
		asleep anyway.

	Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness
	and heads for the door.  Korfin falls in behind him.  As they
	pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.

				KORFIN
			(of the picture)
		She keepin' you up?  Like to meet her,
		huh?  She'd make you forget your ex
		wife.  Cure your insomnia.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN

	CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
	what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment.  The roof has
	been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
	through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.

				EDDIE
		Okay to smoke?

	Jordy turns, surprised.  Eddie sits on a singed chair.  He
	pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton
	soup' container, smoking a cigar.  On the arm of the armchair
	is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
	crime scene and the burned bodies.

				JORDY
		It's your crime scene now.  You can do
		what you want.

				EDDIE
		Watch the news?

				JORDY
		Nah, I musta missed it.

				EDDIE
		Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys
		the credit.

				JORDY
		Well, just so you know, I don't care
		about that stuff.

				EDDIE
		Nah, why should you?

				JORDY
		I don't even watch TV.

				EDDIE
		Good.  Good.  Commendable.

	Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.

				JORDY
		Did you get a report from the M.E.?

				EDDIE
		Sure.  But I would like to ask you
		something.  You got a problem with me?

				JORDY
		If you found me steppin' on your crime
		scene - it might piss you off, too.
			(then)
		What about the report?

				EDDIE
		You were right, they were both dead
		before the fire.  The male was stabbed
		so hard the killer broke off the tip of
		the knife in his spine.  That's usually
		an indicator of something personal.

	Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie.

				JORDY
		The Super said he'd seen her before but
		she didn't live here.

				EDDIE
		Pretty.

				JORDY
			(acts as if he didn't notice)
		Hmmmm.

				EDDIE
		Maybe you don't care about that either.
			(beat)
		Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

				JORDY
		Who says she's a suspect?

	Jordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on.

				EDDIE
		What would you call her?

				JORDY
		Look, I'm not even sure she has anything
		to do with this.  I saw her outside
		after the fire - thought it was a lead. 
		Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was
		visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

	Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.

				EDDIE
		Obviously they weren't having sex.  As
		you pointed out.  So why go through all
		the trouble of putting 'em like that?

	Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.

				JORDY
		Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone
		trying to send a message.  Burial rites
		are taken very seriously in Eastern
		Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. 
		Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
		it's like condemning them to hell.

				EDDIE
		Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? 
		Hungary?

				JORDY
		Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been
		fighting the Germans and the Russians
		for a thousand years.  These are very
		intense people and they take things
		personally.

	Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.

				EDDIE
		Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? 
		Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay.
			(to Jordy)
		We've got another murder - in a hotel on
		Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said
		the room was rented by a Russian...

	Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch. 

				JORDY
		I'll come with you.

				EDDIE
		There wasn't a fire.  There'll be
		nothing for you to do.

				JORDY
		I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll
		learn something.

				EDDIE
		This isn't homicide school.

				JORDY
		My parents are from Poland.  I can help
		with the Eastern European angle.

				EDDIE
		You're Polish?

				JORDY
		My folks are.

				EDDIE
		Stay here.
						

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY

	Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
	picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST.  Eddie's photo is on
	the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires. 
	Underneath his picture the caption reads, "DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
	FLEMMING'S ON IT."  The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
	standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
	front page.  The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
	Oleg himself.

				OLEG
		This is second day in America.  First
		day was very exciting.  Full of thrills
		and chills.  Over there, is co-star of
		my new movie, Emil!

	He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.

				EMIL
			(to vendor)
		Who is he?

				VENDOR
		New York's finest.  This is his case.

	The VENDOR - picks up People.  Stephen Geller is on the
	cover.

				VENDOR (CONT'D)
		This all you want?  

				EMIL
		Do you know how much killer gets for
		movie rights?

				VENDOR
			(People)
		In here, says he wants a million.

				EMIL
		Million?!  The killer gets one million
		dollars for a television interview?

				VENDOR
		Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
		serial killer - half a million for his
		interview.  And how much you think
		Monica got for writing book about the
		President coming on to her?  It pays to
		be a killer or a whore in this country. 
		Look, you want magazine or not?

				EMIL
		Yes.  Both.

				OLEG
		And these.

	Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. 
	Emil pays for everything.

				EMIL
			(to Oleg)
		Get a taxi.

	Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
	and hails a taxi.  As Emil collects his change he sees an old
	BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.  The light's blinking
	WALK.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Let me help.

	Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.

				BLIND WOMAN
		Thank you, son.

	Emil watches her walk on.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	The hotel room is a hive of activity.  GIL is dusting the
	dresser for prints.  Another officer is stripping the bed and
	putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.  As Eddie
	enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
	the doorway taking pictures.

				EDDIE
		Where is she?

				LEON
		Takin' a bath.

				EDDIE
		Any I.D.?

				LEON
		Still unknown but we're running prints. 
		Kid over there caught the case.

	Jordy enters.  Leon steps in his way.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Sorry...PD only.

				EDDIE
		It's okay.

	Eddie walks over to a young detective.  TOMMY CULLEN, only
	26, is excited to meet Eddie.

				TOMMY
		Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you. 
		Nice to meet you.  Here's what we got. 
		A girl in there, figure her to be a
		prostitute, looks like she was fighting
		for her life.  She's got defense wounds
		on her hands.  Right this way - in the
		bathroom.

				EDDIE
		After you.

	Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.  There's blood
	splattered all over the walls and the floor.  Honey's topless
	body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. 
	MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
	body.

				TOMMY
		Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

				JORDY
		Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. 
		Who said he sounded Russian?

				TOMMY
		The clerk?

				EDDIE
		Check the switchboard, see what phone
		calls were made from this room.

				TOMMY
		I'll do it.

	Tommy heads out.  Eddie takes out his cigar holder.  Slides
	out what's left of his cigar.  Re-lights it.  Looks down at
	Honey's body in the bathtub.  Gil's dusting the tub for
	prints.

				MURPHY
		Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub
		is dry except for the blood.

				EDDIE
		Any of you guys take a piss lately?

	Gil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Do the seat for me.

	Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie
	stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the
	unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Only one guys checked in?

				LEON
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide
		school?  Here - make yourself useful.

	Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Our killer...our killer's standing here
		slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. 
		The blood is splattering this way.  It's
		on this wall...
			(pointing to the right of
			 Jordy)
		And there's some specks over here.
			(to the left of Jordy)
		There's nothing here because someone was
		standing right here.  Someone big.  And
		he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. 
		He wouldn't walk out of here like that.
			(turning to Murphy)
		Murphy, what kind of knife you think
		we're talking about here?

	Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
	blood-splattered wall.

				MURPHY
		If you look here where he missed and hit
		the wall you see that the marks aren't
		deep but they're kinda wide... not your
		everyday kitchen or pocket knife.

				EDDIE
		What if the tip was broken off?

				MURPHY
		Could be.  Then we should find it here
		somewhere.

				EDDIE
		I think we've already found it.

	Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
	detective, returns.

				TOMMY
		There was only one call from this room
		last night.  I dialed it.  It's an
		escort service.

				LEON
		Did you identify yourself?

				TOMMY
		Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.

				EDDIE
		Call communications and get an address
		on that number.

	Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
	address on it.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Good work.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY

	Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.

				JORDY
		You goin' to the escort service?

				EDDIE
		You got any better ideas?

				JORDY
		Mind if I ride along with you?

				EDDIE
		This has nothing to do with your fire.

				JORDY
		But what if it does?  You might need my
		help.

	As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.

				MAN
		Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
		my son?

	EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY

	Jordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
	the man's back.

				EDDIE
		I'll let you know what happens.

				JORDY
		This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in
		your way - we can talk the case over.

				EDDIE
		Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. 
		If you win you can come with me.  If you
		don't win, you don't come.

				JORDY
		I'll call it... tails.

	Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads.

	Jordy flips the coin and it's heads.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Heads.  See, you lost twice.
			(beat)
		Okay.  Get in.

	Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy
	can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the
	sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time
	lets Jordy get in.


				WHIP PAN TO:

	INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door.  Eddie knocks
	and flips a coin to Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Oh here.  A souvenir.

	Jordy takes the quarter.  Not understanding what Eddie means. 
	He looks at the quarter.

				JORDY
		Two heads.

				EDDIE
		Better than one.

	Eddie suckered him with the coin toss.  Jordy reacts.  Eddie
	laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth.  Knocks again.  We hear
	ROSE HELLER.

				ROSE (O.S.)
		Who's there?

				EDDIE
		Police.  We'd like to ask you a few
		questions.

				ROSE (O.S.)
		I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna
		contact my attorney...

				EDDIE
			(commands)
		Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective
		Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

	Rose reacts.  Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
	door!  

				ROSE
		You!  I've seen you on TV!

	Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.

				ROSE (CONT'D)
		C'mon in.  C'mon in!

	INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	They enter.

				ROSE
		Just a minute.  Shit.  And I don't have
		a camera.  Hold on a second.

	Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
	in Afrikaner.  We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door.  Eddie
	looks around - taking in the place.  FOUR GIRLS are on
	phones.  Two girls take orders for customers.  The other two
	work the phone sex lines.  Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
	Eddie and Jordy:

				ROSE (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				EDDIE
		We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of
		your girls was killed last night at the
		King Edward Hotel.

				ROSE
		Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?

				JORDY
		Do you remember the man who called?

	Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.

				ROSE
		Yeah.  He wanted a girl from
		Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
		'cause once they get there, you know, it
		doesn't really matter - Honey was
		killed...?  Poor girl...

				EDDIE
		Do you have any Czech girls working for
		you?

				ROSE
		No.

				EDDIE
		Did you tell him you did?

	A BUTCH GIRL enters.  Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.

				ROSE
			(Afrikaner)
		Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

				EDDIE
		What are you saying?

				ROSE
		Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me
		about her, too.

	Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.

				JORDY
		This her?

				ROSE
		Yeah.  Sort of.  I tried to recruit her,
		gave her my card.  She said she'd think
		about it but I never heard from her.

				BUTCH GIRL
			(Afrikaner)
		Beautiful eyes.

				EDDIE
		Who came by looking for her?

				ROSE
		He said he was her cousin.  I told him
		where she works.  They were just here.

				EDDIE
		Describe him.

				ROSE
		Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second
		guy with him was...shorter, with a
		wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn
		his videocamera off me.

				EDDIE
		He had a videocamera?  Where is she? 
		Quickly!

				ROSE
		She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon
		on 63rd and Madison.

	EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

	As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.

	INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

	Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
	astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up
	his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well.

				EDDIE
		Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. 
		Hair salon.  Ludwig's. 

				JORDY
			(overlapping)
		I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 
		63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be
		there already.

	Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer
	he was holding between his legs - finishes it.

				EDDIE
		You thirsty?

				JORDY
		I'm on duty.

				EDDIE
			(drinking)
		So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and
		you cover the back.

				JORDY
		Of course.

				EDDIE
		Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I
		was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a
		door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
		yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! 
		What'd you dream about?

				JORDY
		I wanted to run up to a building on
		fire, kick in the door, rush into the
		smoke and save a kid.

				EDDIE
		Then I guess we're doin' this the right
		way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a
		burning building I'll gladly let you go
		first.

	Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.

	INT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY

	We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon -
	it's big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.

				OLEG (O.S.)
		Daphne Handlova?

				RECEPTIONIST
		Daphne?  In the back.  Probably
		shampooing a customer's hair.

	Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the
	owner, is with her.

				LUDWIG
		Why are you messing with your hair color
		again?  You're going to kill your hair. 
		You won't look good with black hair.

				DAPHNE
		I want to do it, alright?

				LUDWIG
		Well, then do it after work.  A
		customer's waiting.

	He leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns
	on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She
	backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!

	TO THE BACKYARD

	There's a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. 
	Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the
	corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen
	knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
	the broken tip against her throat.

				EMIL
		I...I have a temper.

	She looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		When I lose it, I lose control.  I
		didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole
		from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to
		prison, they beat me.  I still didn't
		tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos
		like a brother...

	The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
	softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
			(in English)
		I'm not a killer.

	The back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as
	Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil
	leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.

				LUDWIG
		Daphne, will you be coming back to work?

				DAPHNE
		In a minute, Ludwig.

	Ludwig leaves.

				EMIL
		Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a
		whore.  But washing hair?  This is no
		job for a woman as beautiful as you. 
		They should be washing your hair.

	Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
	it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		I don't want to kill you.  But if you
		talk, I will.
			(whispers)
		I thought you'd want these.

	He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit.  Oleg
	follows.  Jordy arrives.

				JORDY
		...Daphne?

	She says nothing.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I'm a fire marshal.  You remember me
		from the other night?  You are Daphne,
		right?

	She says nothing.  Eddie arrives.  Daphne turns.  Recognizing
	Eddie.

				EDDIE
		You don't have to be afraid.  We're here
		to protect you.  Come with me.  We want
		to talk to you.  You speak English
		alright?

	Eddie looks at Jordy.  Takes Daphne by the arm.
		
		EXT. LUDWIG'S SALON - CONTINUOUS

	As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
	her hand.  He reaches for her hand.  Opens it.  It's a
	brushed gold necklace.

				EDDIE
		Did he give you these?  Was he just
		here?

	Eddie searches the streets.  Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
	corner.  Oleg is videotaping him.  Leon and Tommy pull up. 
	Korfin behind.  They all pop out.  Eddie grabs Leon -
	squeezes his arm - quietly.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		The other side of the street.  The guy
		with the videocamera.
			(back to Jordy)
		Don't look - put her in the car.
			(to Leon)
		Stay this side.

				LEON
			(back to Tommy)
		Stay with her.

	They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
	attention of Oleg and Emil.

	A VIDEO CLOSE-UP

	of the scene from across the corner.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Put the fuckin' camera down!  Let's go!

	Emil starts to flee.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

	What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
	Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
	Emil.  Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
	breath.

				EDDIE
		Split up!

	Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. 
	Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. 
	They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
	missing him.  Emil seems to have disappeared.

	Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the
	corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon
	crashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the
	gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. 
	People are running from the scene.  Emil takes Leon's wallet. 
	He is distracted by LAUGHTER.  Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.

				OLEG
		Emil, look!

	Oleg swivels with the videocamera.  Korfin is running toward
	them - pushing through the crowd.  Emil FIRES!  Korfin is
	blown backwards.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		Perfect!  Cut.  Print!

	Eddie arrives.  Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
	blood.  Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,
	shot in the side.  Jordy cradles his partner.

				EDDIE
		Are you hit?

				LEON
		No.  I'm okay.

				JORDY
			(to Korfin)
		Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

				KORFIN
		It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

				JORDY
		Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

	Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. 
	Cars screech out of the way!  Eddie crouches, taking aim at
	Emil, who is almost two blocks away.  It's an impossible
	shot, out of range.

	But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two
	blocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
	astonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. 
	Runs.  Eddie holsters his weapon.  Pulls out a handkerchief. 
	Dabs Leon's wounds.

				LEON
		He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming
		the whole time!

				EDDIE
		I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't
		worry, we'll get those fuckers.
						

				DISSOLVE TO:

	EMS VEHICLE

	Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
	an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon's
	bloody face.  Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
	restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
	her cameraman.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective - can you tell us what
		happened here?

				EDDIE
		I can't talk right now.  We have some
		things to take care of.

	Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of
	Nicolette.

	Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
	maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is
	where Eddie and Jordy are headed.

				NICOLETTE
		I understand, but I noticed that the
		Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this
		somehow related to the fire department?

				EDDIE
		I really can't give out any information
		right now at this point.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  But I do understand that your
		partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. 
		Is that correct?

				EDDIE
		He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll
		be fine.

				NICOLETTE
		Do you have the suspect in custody?

				EDDIE
		Um...now is not a good time, okay. 
		Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. 
		I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
		Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

				NICOLETTE
			(to cameraman)
		Alright, cut, cut, cut.

	Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
	shoulder.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
			(to Eddie)
		Eddie, are you okay?

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.

				EDDIE
		Alright?

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.

				EDDIE
		Alright.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.

	Eddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her,
	then enters.

	INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY

	Jordy talks to Daphne. 

				DAPHNE
		I told your partner, I can't help.  I
		didn't see anything.

				EDDIE
		C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know
		these people?

				DAPHNE
		Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower
		was broken, she let me use theirs.

				EDDIE
		Go on.

	She says nothing.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Whether you tell us or not, we'll find
		out.  Better if it comes from you.

				DAPHNE
		If I tell you, will you arrest me?

				EDDIE
		Arrest you for what?  Why would we
		arrest you?

	She still hesitates.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

				JORDY
		She just saw two of her friends killed! 
		They probably threatened her.

				EDDIE
		Is that all there is?

	She looks at Eddie.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Are you here illegally?  Don't worry
		about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. 
		They won't deport you.

				DAPHNE
		No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

	She clams up.

				JORDY
		Why not?

				EDDIE
		Something back home?

	Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across
	from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her.

				DAPHNE
		...my little sister and I shared a flat -
		I came home one night and a man was
		raping her.  His gun was on the chair...
		He came at me and I shot him.

				JORDY
			(optimistic)
		Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

				DAPHNE
		Yes, but he was a cop.

				EDDIE
		A cop?

				DAPHNE
			(beat)
		I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like
		the South here.  The Police is right, a
		civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

				EDDIE
		Look, we can help you but right now we
		have to deal with what's happening here. 
		Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

				DAPHNE
		You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

				JORDY
			(to Eddie)
		Can I talk to you?

	Eddie steps away with Jordy.  Keeping his eyes on Daphne. 
	She tries to listen.

				EDDIE
		She's fucked.  Even if that story is
		true.

				JORDY
		Raw deal.

	Eddie tilts his head.  Measures Jordy.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I
		get, they're all yours.  Just let me
		have a first crack at her.

				EDDIE
		You wanna talk to her alone?

				JORDY
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		What would your girlfriend think of
		that?

				JORDY
		I don't have a girlfriend.

				EDDIE
		My point exactly.

				JORDY
		I'm serious here.

				EDDIE
		So am I.

				JORDY
		C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're
		a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

				EDDIE
		You're her Savior?  Is she the kid
		you're gonna save from the burning
		building?

				JORDY
		You know what I'm saying here.

	Eddie looks at his watch.  Thinks it over.  Measures Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a
		head start.  You take her to the station
		house.  Don't let her out of your sight. 
		She's the only warm body we got left.

				JORDY
		Hey.  I'm a professional.

				EDDIE
		Women like that have a way of turning
		professionals into amateurs.

	He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.

	INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY

	Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
	stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
	pink flesh taken out of his ankle.  Emil grabs some toilet
	paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
	with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle.  He grits teeth
	in pain.  The lights go out.  Then Oleg adjusts the
	fluorescent light above the sink.

				OLEG
		Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's
		more moody... like a scene from THE
		THIRD MAN.

				EMIL
		Shut up.

				OLEG
		Does it hurt?

	Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.

				EMIL
		This is nothing.

	Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.

				OLEG
		Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

				EMIL
		Don't want to film this?

	We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
	expression, it's horrible.

	INT. JORDY'S CAR - DAY

	Daphne rides in the backseat.  Jordy's watching her in the
	rearview.

				DAPHNE
		Now I become custody of police
		department?

				JORDY
		If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
		they'll help you with your situation.

				DAPHNE
		I will if they don't send me back.

				JORDY
		They won't until this is over.

	She looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling
	her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.

				DAPHNE
		Are you married?

				JORDY
		Divorced.

				DAPHNE
		Do you live alone?
			(beat)
		I've been in these clothes since...the
		killings.  Could we stop at your place? 
		I could take a shower...before I go into
		custody?

	Jordy looks at her.  Can't quite tell if she's trying to
	manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
	all the shit starts.

				JORDY
		I can't take you to my place.

				DAPHNE
		Somewhere else?

	Jordy looks at her...
		

	EDDIE

	Staring right at us.

				EDDIE
		I want to talk to you about something
		serious.

	He holds up the diamond engagement ring.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I want to live the rest of my life with
		you...I don't know you've been married
		before and I've never been married, but
		I do love you, and...

	Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
	proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. 
	Leon's blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
	tonic.

				PAULIE
		She's here.

	Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. 
	He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and
	hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps
	Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his
	coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens
	himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
	drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie
	hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
	exits.  Paulie follows.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	It's lunchtime...it's crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a
	table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
	the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. 
	Gives him a kiss on the cheek.

				NICOLETTE
		Hey, honey.

				EDDIE
		Hey.

	She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
	down across the table.  There's a long pause - they just look
	at each other.

				NICOLETTE
		What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at
		me?  I just wanted a statement.

				EDDIE
		I can't...I can't answer you just
		because you want me to answer you!

				NICOLETTE
		You didn't have to embarrass me in front
		of my colleagues.  You could give me
		something.

				EDDIE
		Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you,
		sweetheart?  Oh...

				NICOLETTE
		Stop it.

				EDDIE
		Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
		the cameras and say, do you mind if we
		just work something out?

				NICOLETTE
		Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't
		patronize me.

				EDDIE
		I'm not.

				NICOLETTE
		Yes you are.  I'm not just some
		reporter.  I don't just stick a
		microphone in your face.  You could give
		me something.

				EDDIE
		Yeah, well you took the camera and put
		it right down on the evidence.  That
		was...

				NICOLETTE
		That was good.  You were holding the
		evidence.

				EDDIE
		You were merciless.  You didn't give a
		shit if you got me or not.

				NICOLETTE
		Well, who was it that taught me how to
		do that?  Huh?

				EDDIE
		You're ruthless.

				NICOLETTE
		You're not so bad yourself.

	They look at each other.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		C'mere.

	They kiss.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Look at this.  You have blood on your
		shirt.  Whose is it?

				EDDIE
		Could be Leon's.

				NICOLETTE
		Jesus.  And last week you came over with
		blood on your shoes.  What am I going to
		do with you?

	Eddie takes her hand.

				EDDIE
		You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes
		might look nice with another pair of
		shoes next to them in the closet.

	She looks at him.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		You know, Nicky, I've been married twice
		before.  My first wife was a
		professional woman, didn't have time for
		children.  My second wife...I never
		wanted to go home to her.

	Nicolette's phone rings.  Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
	phone.

				NICOLETTE
		What are you doing?  What are you
		saying?

	Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.  Eddie stares at it.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Eddie?

	Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Don't worry about the damn phone.  I
		won't answer it.

				EDDIE
		Answer the phone.

				NICOLETTE
		No.  Tell me what you want to say.

				EDDIE
		Answer it.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for
		a second.  They only call me when it's
		an emergency.  Just hold that thought.
			(into the phone)
		Can you call back?

				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
		We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get
		in a cab.

				NICOLETTE
		What're you talking about?

				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
		Katie.  We don't know where she is.  We
		can't find her.  You gotta anchor the
		5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now.

				NICOLETTE
		What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.

	The line disconnects.  She collapses the phone.  Turns to
	Eddie.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They
		want me to anchor tonight!

				EDDIE
		That's good.

				NICOLETTE
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		Well, that's great.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go
		now, we're in the middle of something
		here.

				EDDIE
		No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

				NICOLETTE
		No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to
		know what you're talking about.  You
		know, the shoe thing and the marriages
		and...

				EDDIE
		I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it
		tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll
		talk.  We'll talk.

				NICOLETTE
		Promise?

				EDDIE
		I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be
		great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just
		imagine that, uh... Just look into the
		lens and imagine you're talking to me.

				NICOLETTE
		Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're
		not patronizing me.

				EDDIE
		Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

				NICOLETTE
		I love you.

	They kiss.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Okay, til tonight.

				EDDIE
		Tonight.

				NICOLETTE
		You promise?

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I promise.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by
		my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
		and maybe just test them out next to
		yours...How's that... Would that be a
		good thing.

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.

				EDDIE
		See you later.  Good luck.

				NICOLETTE
		Thank you.

				EDDIE
		Don't be late.

	She walks out.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY

	Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire
	station is empty.

				JORDY
		The men are out of quarters - practicing
		putting out fires.

				DAPHNE
		So...the station is empty?

				JORDY
		Yeah.  This way.

	He gestures toward the stairs.

	INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes
	never leaving Jordy's.

				JORDY
		You considered becoming a prostitute?

				DAPHNE
		Yes, I considered it.

				JORDY
		Did you ever turn tricks before?

				DAPHNE
		No.

				JORDY
		What about back home?

				DAPHNE
		No.

	Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no
		one.  I couldn't get a job because you
		have to have a green card to get work. 
		They approached me - I could've made a
		lot of money.  I considered it, but...
		it's not who I am.  They pay me below
		the table at Ludwig's.

				JORDY
		So you were never a prostitute?

				DAPHNE
		What are you asking me?

				JORDY
		I'm just trying to find out who you are.

	She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's
	hinting.

				DAPHNE
		Can you let me go?

	She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
	kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning
	and backs up slightly.

				JORDY
		Showers are this way.

	Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
	closer.

				DAPHNE
		You could shower with me.

	Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks
	away.  Gestures towards the showers. 
	Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the
	showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are
	lined with shower stalls.

				JORDY
		I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.

	He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the
	window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the
	street.

	JORDY

	gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He
	checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We
	follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he
	notices the window.  It's open.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

	He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns -
	looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through
	the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over -
	quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain
	aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding
	herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Are you alright?

	Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.

				DAPHNE
		I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

				JORDY
		I know.

				DAPHNE
		You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was
		desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a
		cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to
		me when I got to prison?

				JORDY
		They're not gonna send you right back.

				DAPHNE
		I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. 
		Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this
		time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look
		anyone in the eyes. 
		Always afraid that someone would find
		out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

	He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.

				JORDY
		You can trust me.

	She embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a
	moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her.
		
		INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY

	CLOSE UP

	on a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets
	down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands
	abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls
	back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.  He is
	taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his
	teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed
	over in pain.  He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews
	them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a
	beer.

	Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the
	"People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller. 
	Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the
	videocamera tilts back up to his face.

				OLEG
		What is it?

				EMIL
		The video of Milos and Tamina - I told
		you to erase it.

				OLEG
		I did.

				EMIL
		And the whore's murder?  You didn't
		erase that either, did you?  Don't lie,
		I won't be angry.

				OLEG
		Why not?

				EMIL
		Put the camera down, Oleg.

	Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil
	removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks
	up Eddie Flemming's name.

				OLEG
		What is that?

				EMIL
		What does it look like?  It's an address
		book!

	Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.

				OLEG
		Let me get a shot of it.

				EMIL
		Sit down!

				OLEG
		This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

	Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		Why won't you be angry at me for keeping
		my movie?

	Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps
	away.  Oleg follows.
		

	INT. PRECINCT - DAY

	It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's
	desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more
	aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting
	Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns
	and sees Jordy and Daphne.

				DUFFY
		Hey.  Warsaw.

	Jordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench.

				JORDY
		Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

				DUFFY
		I came to see how the investigation was
		going.
			(looks at Daphne)
		I called and you're not here.  I wait up
		at the station and you don't even show
		up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my
		call.  Where the hell have you been?!

	Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne.

				JORDY
		Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. 
		We stopped there... so she could get
		cleaned up.

				DUFFY
		What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

				JORDY
		I let her take a shower.

				DUFFY
		A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

				JORDY
		No!  Nothing happened.

				DUFFY
		Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a
		homicide witness to take a shower after
		your partner was shot?  Are you out of
		your fucking mind??  Are you having that
		much trouble gettin' dates?!

				EDDIE (O.S.)
		I told him to take her there.

	Jordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy -
	the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward
	Hotel - is coming out of the back office.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Tommy, get her outta here.

	Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.

				TOMMY
		This way, ma'am.

				EDDIE
		There was too much press hangin' around
		there.  I didn't want her face on the
		news.  So I told him to take her to a
		quiet area until things settled down.

				DUFFY
		Oh.

				EDDIE
		It was my decision, not his.

				DUFFY
		Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
		and every now and then I'd like to be
		included in decisions.

				EDDIE
		Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
		the press conference.  How about that? 
		The case is all yours.

				DUFFY
		Oh yeah...?  Alright.

				EDDIE
			(to Jordy)
		I'm ready to be briefed.
			(to Duffy)
		Excuse us.

				DUFFY
			(to Eddie)
		Yeah, sure.
			(to Jordy)
		Beep me when you're ready for the press
		conference.

				JORDY
		Will do, Chief.

	Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk -
	toward the back and to his office.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Eddie, I...

	Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Wait.

	INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM'S SQUAD - DAY

	A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. 
	Eddie enters with Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Guys...give me a few minutes?

	They empty out.

				JORDY
		Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't
		touch her.

				EDDIE
		Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna
		believe you didn't...including me.

				JORDY
		I took her there for a shower and that's
		it.

				EDDIE
		Just a shower?

	Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look.

				JORDY
		Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing
		happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably
		think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

				EDDIE
		No, I don't think you were a fool, I
		just think you were stupid about it.  I
		mean, to say the least, you outta know
		better.  You don't know her well enough. 
		She's got the potential to fucking hang
		you even if she suggests that you made a
		pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can
		deny it all you want, but it will not
		make one fucking bit of difference. 
		You're dead.

				JORDY
		I told you, you know, I thought I was
		doing the right thing, you know, I think
		she's innocent.

				EDDIE
		Well, it's not up to you to decide
		whether she's innocent or not.  Don't
		you understand, that's why you're a
		professional.

				JORDY
		But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a
		limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda
		heard her there.  Tellin' her whole
		story...I believed her.

				EDDIE
		How you go out on a limb for somebody is
		by giving her a number of an Immigration
		lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an
		Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help
		her. 
		But you can't get involved in her like
		that.  You're gonna jeopardize your
		career, your life and you're gonna
		jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you
		another piece of advice.  Maybe you
		don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a
		little secret - the whole fuckin' world
		watches television.  And when you get
		out there, they know your face.  And the
		little fame, the little fuckin' itty
		bitty fame that I get in this city makes
		it a lot easier for my job.  And I get
		more done because of it.

	Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.

				JORDY
		Why'd you help me back there with the
		Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like
		that?

				EDDIE
		You know, I don't know.  I like you. 
		You remind me of a puppy I used to have. 
		He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
		still kept him.

	Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out.  He sticks it in
	his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the
	match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The
	homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.
		

	INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the
	door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials.

				EDDIE
		It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did
		they check the hospitals?  Airports? 
		Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We
		should be all over everywhere - with
		dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys
		are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...

	He looks at the flowers.  Decides to put the case behind him
	for a moment.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I'll call you later.

	He HANGS up.  Arranges the flowers in a vase.  So they look
	perfect.  Sets them on the coffee table.  Fills out a card,
	writes, "Nicky, I love you. 
	Will you marry me?"  He sticks the card in the flowers -
	turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
	the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself a
	drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
	flowers.  There's a knock at the door.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Coming!

	Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.  But the hallway is
	empty.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky!?!?

	No answer.  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
	his hand.  Walks toward the elevator.  Doesn't notice the
	shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. 
	Eddie turns.  No sign of anyone.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky?!

	He walks back toward his apartment.  Turns and locks the
	door.  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
	head with a gun.  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD!

	A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE

	as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
	to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.  Emil is sitting
	in front of him.  On the coffee table alongside him are the
	flowers in a vase.  They've ransacked the place.  Emil has
	Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money.  He's smoking
	one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond
	engagement ring and card.  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
	positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.  He moves to the
	corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
	Eddie's face.

				EMIL
		So...who's Nicky?

				EDDIE
		What do you want?

				EMIL
		Your opinion.
			(leaning forward)
		You see, they going to make a movie
		about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

				EDDIE
			(sarcastic)
		What's your accomplishment.

				EMIL
		I kill someone famous.

				EDDIE
		Then do it, asshole.

				EMIL
		Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who
		plays you will want to die like hero.

	Eddie looks at the videocamera.  Emil answers Eddie's look.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		So tabloids don't have to do re
		enactments.  They going to have real
		movie this time.

				EDDIE
		If you kill me and film it you're
		putting a noose around your neck.

	Emil turns to Oleg.

				EMIL
		Turn it off.

	Oleg obeys.  Emil turns to Eddie.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy
		men would film their murders?
			(gestures to Eddie)
		So we kill someone famous and if we are
		caught, we are sent to mental hospital. 
		But what good is money there?  Because
		once in hospital I say I not crazy. 
		Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see
		psychiatrists.  They must certify we are
		sane and because of your - what is law
		called?
			(Eddie says nothing)
		Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double
		Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same
		crime twice.  We come out free, rich and
		famous!

				OLEG
		Good idea!

				EDDIE
		You really think you'll be able to fool
		a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin'
		stupid are you?

				EMIL
		Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry
		baby talk shows all day long.  Not only
		will Americans believe me, they'll cry
		for me.
			(laughs)
		So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
		like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? 
		Maybe you can propose to her now?

	Eddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on
	Eddie's cigar.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Okay.  He has nothing to say.
			(signaling Oleg)
		Start the camera!

				OLEG
		Cut!

	Emil looks at Oleg.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say 'action!'

	Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what I have to put up
	with."  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		And...action!

	Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddie
	suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,
	backing out of Eddie's reach.

				EMIL
		Bad last moment - I cut that out.

	Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's
	left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
	gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standing
	and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over
	into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
	Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.

	Oleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around
	with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
	him to the wall.

	Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
	Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
	with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
	repeatedly.

	Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
	from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
	onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and
	leaving Oleg on the sofa.

	Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
	in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
	gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
	not clear in the darkness who has the gun.

	Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
	videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
	as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
	toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
	window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.

	Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
	toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
	the stomach.

	Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
	STOMACH.

	Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
	the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got
	stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be
	dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain
	is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
	close up.

	Emil looks at Eddie.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Die.  Die.

	Emil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
	off, suffocating him.
		

	BLACKNESS

	We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
	feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,
	in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. 
	We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
	tiny pixel on a TV screen.

	WIDENING

	further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's
	an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
	dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
	over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
	his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with
	the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio
	from Eddie's funeral.

				NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
		..Detective Flemming was one of the most
		decorated NYPD detectives in the history
		of New York.  He made several thousand
		arrests during his career, including the
		famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by
		the community in which he served.  His
		partner eulogized him...

	Leon is at the mic. 

				LEON (ON T.V.)
		...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
		and my partner...he taught me the
		meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man
		in every sense of the word.  I'll miss
		him...
			(choking on tears)
		Sleep well, brother.

	Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace."  Oleg PANS from the TV
	and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -
	carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long
	hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
	pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. 
	Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,
	the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
	table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
	revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	It's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many
	who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black
	ribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake -
	boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet
	has been laid out.

	Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He
	greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.

				HAWKINS
		Awful...what an awful day.  He was New
		York City.

	Hawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's
	Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him.

				TOMMY
		I never got to tell him how much I
		admired him.

				HAWKINS
		I know, son, I know.  We all loved him.

	Hawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of
	the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves
	to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at
	him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. 
	Definitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins.

				NICOLETTE
		You know...you know he was gonna propose
		to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd
		written out to me.  And a ring
		box...these fuckers that killed him -
		have my ring.  They have my diamond
		engagement ring...

	Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.

				HAWKINS
		I know.

				NICOLETTE
		What do you mean you know?  He told you
		he was gonna propose to me?

				HAWKINS
		Well, he...

				NICOLETTE
			(overriding)
		I want to hear everything he said.

				HAWKINS
		I'm trying to tell you.

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.  Go ahead.

				HAWKINS
		That morning.  He was talking to me and
		Leon about marriage.

				NICOLETTE
		Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. 
		He started making overtures - talking
		about little shoes next to his in his
		closet but I got a call to anchor - and
		I walked out on him.  I walked out on
		him when he was trying to ask me to
		marry him!!

	Nicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		I'd never had a great relationship
		before.  I'd never made great choices
		with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to
		know.  He was older, my parents told me
		I was nuts to get involved with him. 
		But he was so great to me.  Always
		encouraging, telling me I could do
		anything...
			(beat)
		He was the one.  You know, I'd give up
		everything - everything - for just a
		little more time.  I would've spent
		fifteen minutes with him if that's all I
		knew I had.

	She's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him
	off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A
	woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.

				MAGGIE
		Robert...?

				HAWKINS
		What are you doing here?

				MAGGIE
			(holding a cellular)
		You've got a call.

				HAWKINS
		I can't talk to anybody right now, can't
		you see I'm busy!  I can't talk
		business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.
			(to Paulie)
		Get her a whiskey.

				MAGGIE
		Trust me, you'll want to take this call.

	Robert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.

				HAWKINS
		Hello?  Who is this?
			(listens)
		How do I know this is you?

	Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. 
	Backs away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he
	looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		Where?

	We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
	theater.  Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws
	glances into the theater.

				EMIL
		Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the
		Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my
		next film.

				HAWKINS
			(low)
		Look asshole.  I've been threatened by
		better than you.

				EMIL
		No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened
		you.

				HAWKINS
		I'll meet you on one condition - I get
		exclusivity and you surrender to me.

				EMIL
		We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock
		gives you time to go to bank.  Three
		hundred thousand dollars.

				HAWKINS
		What?  It doesn't work that way.

				EMIL
			(incensed)
		If you don't want my film - I'll call
		another show.  And they will show it.

				HAWKINS
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

				EMIL
		Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk
		about surrendering.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the
	phone back to Maggie.  She's looking at him.  Excited. 
	Hawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY

	Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin's arm is in
	a sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their
	dress uniforms.  Korfin walks over to them.

				KORFIN
		How was it?

				JORDY
			(numb)
		Not good.

	Jordy's quiet.  Dazed.  Nobody can believe Eddie's gone.

				DUFFY
			(nods to Daphne)
		Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

				KORFIN
		Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

				DUFFY
			(to Korfin)
		Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let
		her pick up her clothes and take her
		straight to Hoover Street.  You got
		that?

				KORFIN
		Yeah.

	Jordy looks at her.  Duffy sees them hold each other's look.

				JORDY
		Chief - mind if I take her?

				DUFFY
		Okay.  But not water sports.

	Duffy walks out.  Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. 
	Korfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello
	who points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.

				MAN
		Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?

				JORDY
		Yeah.

				MAN
			(shoving papers in Jordy's
			 hand)
		Consider yourself served.

	Jordy opens the papers.  Korfin puts Daphne in the car. 
	Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.

				KORFIN
		Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the
		department and the city of New York for
		10 million?  Who is Zwangendaba?

	Jordy remembers...and gets more depressed.

				JORDY
		The mugger.
						
		EXT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	It's an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. 
	Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering
	her to the door.  He is edgy.  Jumpy.  Looking around.

				DAPHNE
		Are you alright?

				JORDY
		I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

				DAPHNE
		I'm sorry.

	He looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the
	front door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls
	Daphne out of the way.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
			(in Czech to the man)
		Hello.  How are you?

	INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of
	flowers are outside Daphne's apartment.

				JORDY
		What's this?

	She takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne
	reads: "Good luck with all your troubles.  I'm here if you
	need me...Ludwig."

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Is he your boyfriend?

				DAPHNE
		Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

				JORDY
		If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

				DAPHNE
		If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest
		you find another girlfriend that isn't
		going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

	They're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension
	strong.

				JORDY
		A good Immigration lawyer could stall
		the process.  Eddie recommended one.

				DAPHNE
		No matter what happens...I'm glad I met
		you.

				JORDY
		I'm glad I met you.

	They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. 
	Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. 
	They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the
	hall.  Jordy clears his throat.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Let's get your stuff.

	He opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to
	her.  Gestures that it's okay to enter.

	INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	It's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. 
	The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking
	the same thought.  Another kiss. 

				JORDY
		You better get packed.

				DAPHNE
		Right.

	She holds his look.

				JORDY
		Do you have coffee?

				DAPHNE
		In the kitchen.

				JORDY
		I'll make some for us.

				DAPHNE
		I'll get my clothes.

	She heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He
	flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -
	SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO
	THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		Jordy!!!

				JORDY
		No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!

	Jordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows
	the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices
	a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it
	at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne
	SCREAMS!

				DAPHNE
		That's not mine!

	WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames
	leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
	because it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy
	CAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and
	JORDY'S HAND.

	He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. 
	Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it
	under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He
	hurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before
	the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. 
	Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
	chair through the window.

				JORDY
		Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!

	Too late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in
	the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along
	the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,
		make it quick, we're trapped!  8th
		Avenue and 44th Street.

	He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy
	kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that
	under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. 
	Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
	water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. 
	She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top
	of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.

				DAPHNE
		Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!

	Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		They were here!

	This freaks her out.  They were in her home.  She starts to
	panic.

				JORDY
		Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get
		down!

	He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.  In it is a CAN OF
	GASOLINE.  A virtual bomb.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Oh Jesus!

	Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing?

				DAPHNE
		Pouring it out!

	She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.  The
	FIRE is raging outside the bathroom.  The bathroom door is
	beginning to smoke and burn.  They are trapped.

	Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
	wall to the ceiling.  He throws his feet against the wall for
	leverage.  Pulls with all his might to break it loose.  It's
	creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.

				DAPHNE (CONT'D)
		Oh shit!

	Jordy looks over.  The gasoline she's pouring out - is not
	going down the drain.  It's stopped up.  As soon as the fire
	gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!

	Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. 
	Daphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break
	it off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. 
	SOAKING THE WALLS.  They point the pipe toward the door,
	soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. 
	Trying to stop the fire from coming in.  He and Daphne are
	drenched.  And trapped.

	Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.  Starts SMASHING the wall
	behind them.  The wall to the adjacent apartment.

	VIDEO POV

	Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. 
	CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.

	OLEG

	is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.  Tenants from
	Daphne's building are fleeing down the fire escape.  Emil
	stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited.  He turns the
	camera on himself.

				OLEG
		This is great film!  You can see fire
		right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire
		Marshal is here.  Everything is so
		messy.  Everything is so crazy right
		here!  Look at this fire!  We made it! 
		90% of people who die in fire die from
		eating smoke.  So most likely they all
		die from eating smoke.

	The CAMERA PANS to Emil.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		And this is the man who started the
		fire.  Say something to your fans, Emil!

	Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens.

	DAPHNE'S BATHROOM

	Filled with smoke.  You can barely see Jordy or Daphne. 
	Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom
	in the apartment next door.  The smoke has a place to escape. 
	There's a 7-year old KID in there.  Standing in the bathroom. 
	Terrified.

				JORDY
		Get back!  Get out of the bathroom! 
		Run!

				7-YEAR OLD KID
		The hallway is on fire!

				JORDY
		It's okay.  I'm a fireman.  I'm going to
		help you.  Get back!  Now!

	Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom
	door catches fire.  It's seconds before the whole room will
	blow up.

	OLEG

	Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Fire engines have arrived.  The street is filled with
	gawkers.  Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
	the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
	with the other.  Carefully guarding his bandaged hand.  A
	fireman grabs the kid.  Another grabs Daphne.  Garcia and
	Korfin run to Jordy.

				GARCIA
		Jordy!  What the hell happened?!

				KORFIN
		Are you alright, man?  Lemme see the
		hand!

				JORDY
		Where's Daphne?  Daphne?

	He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes
	through the crowd.

				VOICE
		Isn't she a beauty?  She's my fire, look
		at that loom-up on her!

	Jordy turns - it's Max.  The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
	threw out of his office.  As a news crew arrives, Max turns
	to the cameras.

				MAX
		I did this!  I did this!  Take my
		picture!  I'm Max!  Max Gornick!

	Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away.

				JORDY
		Get outta here!

				KORFIN
		What the hell happened?

				JORDY
		They were inside.  They booby trapped
		her apartment!

	Korfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the
	b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING.

				DUFFY
		What the hell are you talking about??? 
		They're gonna do what?

	Jordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and
	is freaked.

	INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT

	JORDY'S POV

	as he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still
	wet.  The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still
	in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
	producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.

				TOMMY
		Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?!

				MAGGIE
		He's not on the premises!

				LEON
		I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it
		here this minute.

				MAGGIE
		Any request for the video must be
		directed to "Top Story's" attorney -
		Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you
		his number.

	Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes
	past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward
	Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries
	to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.

				LEON
		Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,
		I'll get a warrant for your arrest and
		shove it so far up your ass it'll come
		outta your mouth!

				MAGGIE
		I want your shield number!

				HAWKINS (O.S.)
		Viewer discretion advised!

				MAGGIE
			(pointing at the TV)
		You want the tape?  There it is!

	Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
	which is mounted in the lobby.  The "Top Story" logo flashes
	on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.

				HAWKINS
		What we are about to broadcast is very
		graphic footage...

	Everyone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a "Top
	Story" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins
	jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out.

	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT

	POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
	popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
	table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the
	glass - looking into the lens.

				EMIL
		America!  Who says you can't be success
		in America?  I arrived with nothing,
		knowing nobody - now look - I am a
		success story!

	The videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks
	suspiciously.

				OLEG
		You are success story?  I am success
		story!  Why do you say I and not we?

				EMIL
		Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a
		hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't
		you?  I gave you half of what they gave
		me.  Look - here we are!

	Emil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in
	Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
	watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins
	is introducing his show.

				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
		Good evening.  Welcome to "Top Story". 
		Tonight, I present to you material of a
		graphic and violent nature never before
		seen on television.  And I do so with a
		heavy heart.  You will be first-hand
		witness to the slaying of celebrated New
		York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
		Flemming.  It would be only normal to
		ask, why?  Why are we showing something
		so journalist, I must show it.  A
		democracy survives through the freedom
		of its media, and if we cannot see what
		is happening then we don't deserve our
		democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie
		Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I
		watched this footage and vowed to fight
		this violence with every molecule of my
		being from this day onward.  Hopefully,
		this will have a similar effect on you. 
		One final word, this material is
		absolutely not appropriate for children.

	The restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch.

				OLEG
		In movie they make of us, who do you
		think would act me?

				EMIL
		The one who got caught in the bathroom.
			(beat)
		George Michael.

	Emil laughs.  Oleg doesn't.

				OLEG
		I'm serious.

				EMIL
		Shut up.  Look!

	Emil points towards the TV.  "Top Story" is continuing.  The
	scene cuts to Emil's video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to
	the chair.  The light illuminating his face.

				OLEG (O.S.)
		This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say 'action.'
			(beat)
		And 'action!'

				EMIL
		Bad last moment - I cut it out.

	Emil looks at Oleg - furious.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		I told you to cut that out before we
		handed in the tape!

				OLEG
		Be quiet.  Watch.

	Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
	Eddie's temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then
	knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
	the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
	Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie
	and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the
	way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. 
	Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and
	he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The
	blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
	light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down
	for a CLOSE-UP.

				EMIL
		Die.  Die.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

	Hawkins' van drives across Times Square.  Jordy's car
	following.  We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast
	on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.  People stare up - stunned.

	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

	The dinner patrons are watching TV.  Shocked.  Emil glares at
	Oleg.

				EMIL
		Why did you leave that stuff in about
		you being the director?

				OLEG
		Because I am the director.  Don't you
		realize, if it wasn't for my film, for
		my talent, my idea to do this - no way
		would we be sitting here right now.

				EMIL
		Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

	Oleg tenses.  Emil laughs.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Aren't you just the cameraman?

	Oleg doesn't laugh.

				OLEG
		I'm serious...this - this is a great
		American film.  Full of violence and
		sex.  And I want my credit.

				EMIL
		Credit?

				OLEG
		Yes.  Before we hand in the next video -
		I put titles on it and my credit is
		going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

				EMIL
		Yes.  But there's only one problem - you
		want credit but the problem is - I don't
		share credit.

	Oleg is pissed.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		You got that?

				OLEG
		No, I don't get that!

				EMIL
		You think you are a director?  You are a
		fucking little, small Russian piece of
		shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate
		you.

	Emil slaps Oleg across the face.  Oleg stands up.  Emil
	suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the
	trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!  Emil squeezes off a
	shot through the crowded restaurant.  Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
	runs through the restaurant, escaping.  It's chaos. 
	Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
	confident, tough criminal attorney.

	Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
	pressing it to his wound.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Oh, hello.

	Cutler accesses the situation.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Are you my attorney?
			(extends his hand to Cutler)
		I'm Emil.  I'm insane.

				CUTLER
		I'm not your lawyer until I see the
		money.

				EMIL
		Here.  I have your money.

	Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.  Cutler
	opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. 
	Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
	aside.  Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
	freaking.  He's lost the most important thing in his life.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Oh no!  No!  Shit!

				CUTLER
			(follows Emil - reaching out to
			 him)
		Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit
		down.  What do you need?  What are you
		looking for?

				EMIL
		He has the camera!  He took the movie!

	Jordy comes in, gun raised.

				JORDY
		Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands
		up!  Drop it!

	Emil puts his hands in the air.  Immediately drops the gun!

				EMIL
		I give up!

	Jordy is disappointed!  He didn't want to take Emil alive. 
	Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
	Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head.

				CUTLER
		This man is unarmed, officer.  He's
		surrendered.

	Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		What are you hitting him for?

				JORDY
		Turn that camera off!

	Jordy handcuffs him.  Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
	appearing more hurt than he is.

				EMIL
		No.  Keep filming...

	Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
	that moment why he's surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up -
	dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
	favoring his ankle.

				CUTLER
			(to Emil)
		Don't say anything.

				EMIL
		Where are we going?

				CUTLER
		I'm coming with you.

				EMIL
		Yes.  Yes, come with me!

				CUTLER
			(to Jordy)
		I'm invoking rights - this man is
		represented by counsel.  I'm coming with
		him.

	The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything. 
	Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he's in the video
	footage.

				JORDY
		Turn that camera off!

	EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

	As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. 
	Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
	to his car.  Leon grabs Emil.

				LEON
		I'll take him.

				JORDY
		No way!  He's mine!

				LEON
			(holding on to Emil, squeezing
			 his arm hard)
		We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

				JORDY
		He's my collar!

				LEON
		Well, he killed my partner!

				JORDY
		He's yours but I take him in!  I'll
		drive him to the precinct, you can have
		him but I'm walkin' him in.

	Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
	custody.

				LEON
		Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll
		follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him!

	Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are
		goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile
		when they put you down!

	Cutler hurries to Emil's side.

				CUTLER
		Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his
		taunting!
			(to Leon)
		He's represented by counsel.  You want
		to speak to someone - you speak to me!

				TOMMY
		Out of the way, counselor.

	Tommy shoves Cutler aside.

				CUTLER
		Don't you put your hands on me,
		Detective.

	Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon
	turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.

				LEON
		And you, you'll pay for what you did!

				HAWKINS
			(low)
		This footage will work in your favor. 
		When the jury sees this - no matter what
		Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

	Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.

				LEON
		You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of
		yourself.

				HAWKINS
		If I didn't put it on somebody else
		would!  I was his friend!

				LEON
		Don't give me that fucking shit.

	The cameras are rolling.

				MURPHY
		Don't get into it on TV.

				LEON
			(yells to other cop cars)
		Alright, let's get going!

	Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already
	behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
	seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away.
		
	INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT

	Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the
	lights.

				TOMMY
		What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose
		everybody!

	Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
	Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
	lane - having lost the police.

				TOMMY (CONT'D)
		Where are you goin'??  This ain't the
		way to the station!

	Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.

	EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy pulls off on 130th Street.  They are way uptown in the
	middle of nowhere.  The car drives down a dark street.  
	Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
	no people around.

	EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The car slows down.  Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's
	going on.  Jordy stops at a dead end.  Pulls open the back
	door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
	deserted tunnel.

				TOMMY
		Jordy...??? Listen to me.  You can't do
		this.  This isn't the way to do things.

	Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.

				JORDY
		Were you a fireman?  That how you knew
		how to rig the apartment?

				EMIL
		My father was.  He gave me many lessons
		about fire.  Now it's my friend.

				JORDY
		Tommy, take a walk.

				TOMMY
		What are you gonna do?

				JORDY
		Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna
		get caught!  That's why he videotaped
		Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna
		get off.

				TOMMY
		Don't stoop to his level!

	Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.

				JORDY
		Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

				TOMMY
		Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

				JORDY
			(erupting)
		GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR
		AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
		KILL YOU, TOO!!!

	Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car.  Climbs behind
	the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
	the darkness.  Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol.  The one Emil
	took from Eddie.  Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
	left.  Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in
	Emil's belt.  He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
	center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and
	throws them aside.  Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
	around to face him.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Get your hands up!  Get your hands up!

	Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
	same place he put Emil's.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You wanna be a real American?  Go for
		your gun.

	Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for
	the gun.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Pull the gun!  You want to be famous? 
		Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and
		make more money.

	Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.

				EMIL
		You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. 
		Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you
		never shot anybody in your life.

				JORDY
		You'll be my first.

	Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
	Emil's eyes.

				EMIL
		C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh,
		look, you're sweating.  You don't have
		the balls.

				JORDY
		Get down on your knees.

	Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech.  SIRENS
	fill the air.  Police cars come flying down the street.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Where's your partner?

				EMIL
		The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. 
		Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

	Leon runs up.  Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill
	Emil.

				LEON
		Gimme your gun, Jordy.  We all want him
		dead but you can't do it this way.

	Emil is still smiling.  Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
	face.  Knocking him to the floor.  He jumps in his car and
	speeds away.
		
		INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of
	Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg's room.  Jordy
	follows behind him - gun aimed at his back.

				WAITER
		Do you really need me?

				JORDY
		Keep your mouth shut.  Don't mess this
		up.

	They reach the room.  Jordy flattens himself against the
	wall.  The waiter KNOCKS.

				HOOKER'S VOICE
		Who's there?

				WAITER
			(nervous)
		R-room service.

	A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
	out at the waiter.

				HOOKER
		Come in.

	Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
	the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom
	door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the
	bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He's hooked
	up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
	footage of the fire.

				OLEG
		Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. 
		No cuts.
			(excited)
		And look.  Look at that transition. 
		That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?!

	Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.

				JORDY
		Don't move!

	Oleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and
	picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of
	the hookers for protection.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Drop the girl!  Drop her!!

	Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into
	the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes
	out into the

	HOTEL HALLWAY

	Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down
	the stairwell.

	EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

	Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs
	through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases
	him, gun in hand!

	Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic,
	cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. 
	Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. 
	Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his
	underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He's holding
	the camera in his hand.  It's on.

				JORDY
		STOP!  STOP THAT MAN!

	A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking
	him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into:

	INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door.

				TICKET TAKER
		Hey, come back here!

	The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy
	counter.  Jordy rushes in the door.

				JORDY
		Where is he?  Where'd he go?

				TICKET TAKER
		Middle door.

	Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle
	door - and enters the theater through the far door.

	INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

	Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It's a
	night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. 
	He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle.

				DRUNK'S VOICE
		Kill him!  Kill the bastard!

	Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.  Others start
	YELLING for blood!

				AUDIENCE
		Shoot him!  SHOOT!

	A GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes
	the shots are coming from the screen.

				OLEG
		Look!  Over here!

	Jordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
	film Jordy's death with a videocamera. 
	Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
	the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
	and heads, bounding for the screen.

				JORDY
		Everybody down!  Stay DOWN!

	Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the
	audience don't realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg
	leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. 
	Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES
	back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a
	clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy
	raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! 
	Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has
	disappeared.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

	SIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as
	they enter.

	CLOSE ON TV

	A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie
	theater.

				REPORTER (ON T.V.)
		...and the wild chase through Times
		Square ended with the suspect, Oleg
		Razgul, escaping.  The fire department
		has identified the fire marshal involved
		in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.

	The channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same
	story.

				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
		In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's
		attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for
		handling sensational cases - claims his
		client is unfit to stand trial.

	INT. JAIL CELL - WIDER - DAY

	Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell.  Watching TV
	through the bars.  She is in the fire department's holding
	cell in Brooklyn.

				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
		In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
		not the alleged mastermind behind the
		murders. 
		According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was
		being directed by his partner, who
		threatened to kill him if he didn't
		follow Mr. Razgul's orders.  Cutler told
		reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in
		fact stab his client.

	The scene CUTS TO Cutler's press conference.

				CUTLER
		My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. 
		What's happened is not his fault.  Emil
		was under the influence of his partner. 
		At the trial, you'll see that my client
		will be vindicated...

	INT. BELLEVUE - MENTAL OBSERVATION UNIT - DAY

	The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set.  We are now in an
	interview room, a guard is posted outside the room.  Emil
	sits at a small table - with Cutler.  Emil is dressed in
	Bellevue clothes.  He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. 
	Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler.

				CUTLER
		I brought you some letters.  It's really
		fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to
		buy you clothes, another sent a check. 
		Another wants a check.

				EMIL
		You bring the cigarettes?

				CUTLER
		Oh, sure.

	Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in
	Emil's mouth and lights it for him.  Emil has never smoked
	before.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		How're they treating you, alright
			(Emil is nonresponsive)
		I want to get the cuffs off... but
		there's a little bit of a problem. 
		Things out there are very negative right
		now for us.  We gotta change that
		around.  Perception is very, very
		important.  Perception is reality.  I
		know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's
		important that I get that message out. 
		Cause that's our only defense in this
		case.

	Emil leans forward.  Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
	between his lips.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		I want you to focus on three things:
		fear...

	He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		...delusions and paranoia.

				EMIL
		I was all of these.

				CUTLER
		Well, you didn't appreciate the severity
		of it until recently.  No question about
		that.

				EMIL
		What about Oleg?

				CUTLER
		Disappeared.  They're looking
		everywhere.  Maybe he went back to
		Czechoslovakia.

				EMIL
		No, he is here.  Shit...

				CUTLER
		Don't worry about him.  Think about
		yourself.

				EMIL
		What about my movie rights?  Book
		rights?

				CUTLER
		Look, I haven't really focused on that
		kind of thing.

				EMIL
		What's your cut?  How much?

				CUTLER
		I would say...half.  Half is fair.

				EMIL
			(laughs)
		No.  No way.

				CUTLER
		But it's...

				EMIL
		Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call
		another lawyer.  This is the biggest
		case of your life.  Don't try to
		negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or
		no.

				CUTLER
		This is not about money, Emil.  I need
		your trust in me.

				EMIL
		What else do you need?

				CUTLER
		I need to know about your background.  I
		need to know about your upbringing.  Why
		you're here.

				EMIL
			(indicating cigarette)
		Give me another one, please.

	Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth.  Lights it.

				CUTLER
		Tell me about yourself.  What you did as
		a young boy... what your parents were
		like.

				EMIL
		My father always degraded me.  Killed my
		self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

				CUTLER
		Your mother was blind?

				EMIL
		Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. 
		She went to fucking black market doctor
		to induce me.

				CUTLER
		Back in the Czech Republic?

				EMIL
		Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
		drugs which made her go blind.  And my
		father blamed me for her blindness...

				CUTLER
		Your father blamed you for your mother's
		blindness?

				EMIL
		Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
		born.  Put it out.  Can you put the
		cigarette out?

	Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes
	it.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		That's what he did to me.  He put
		cigarettes out on me.

				CUTLER
		Your father put cigarettes out on you?

				EMIL
		Out on my back when I was a small boy.

				CUTLER
		Can I see your back?

	Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS
	ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
	CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified.

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		Oh, Jesus.

				EMIL
		I'm abused.  Don't you think?

				CUTLER
		I don't think it's abuse, I think it's
		torture.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy
	stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can
	see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a
	subpoena in his hand.

				DUFFY
		The public doesn't have any idea what we
		do and now you're going to define our
		image!  This is going to be our Rodney
		King!

				JORDY
		What was I supposed to do?  The guy
		tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop
		back - I just forgot.

				DUFFY
		Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a
		tree?!

				JORDY
		Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
		guy was no innocent civilian.

				DUFFY
		Well this is gonna end your career and
		probably mine.

				JORDY
		End my career?

				DUFFY
		How are you going to fight this?  Maybe
		if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd
		been on the front page, as a hero, this
		thing would be easier to fight.  You'd
		have the good to weight against the bad! 
		It's unfortunate that I have to make
		decisions based upon your press coverage
		but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme
		your shield.

				JORDY
		But Chief?  Over this??

				DUFFY
		There's nothing to talk about.  Get a
		good lawyer.  You're suspended until
		your trial.

	Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops
	his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun
	- looks at it.

				DUFFY (CONT'D)
			(pats Jordy's shoulder)
		I know you got backup at home.  Drop it
		off.

	Jordy sighs and exits.

	INT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY

	Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In
	another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
	U.S. ATTORNEYS.

				STERN
			(to Jordy)
		Look, what don't you understand?  We've
		got a good relationship with the Czech's
		and the State Department doesn't want to
		cause an incident.

				JORDY
		But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!

				STERN
		They've got her testimony on videotape. 
		And even if they do take her to court
		immediately after she'll be extradited. 
		The Czechs want her back.  She shot a
		cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
		Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
		Republic?  How would you feel if the
		Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!

	Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers
	his voice.

				STERN (CONT'D)
		And just between us...I was married to a
		redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are
		like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from
		both.

	Jordy gives him a look.

				STERN (CONT'D)
		You want to see her - go ahead.

	Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The
	assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.

				JORDY
		We're gonna fight the extradition.

	Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.

				DAPHNE
		Forget about me.  You have enough
		problems of your own.

				JORDY
		...Do you really want me to forget about
		you?

				DAPHNE
		I don't want to drag you down with me.

				JORDY
		Daphne, I...

	Daphne touches her finger to his lips.

				DAPHNE
		Shhhh.

	She leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes,
	trying to find a smile.

	EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY

	It's weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
	frazzled.  She's trying to go through her stand up.  But
	she's unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.

				NICOLETTE 
		...and today with his partner who he
		blamed for the crimes still at large,
		Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His
		lawyer will argue that he is mentally 
		unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News
		has also learned that later this month,
		Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing
		in court.  He will be arraigned on
		charges of violating the civil rights
		of...Zwangen...Zwagen...

				MIKE
		Zwangendaba.

				NICOLETTE
		Goddamn assholes everywhere. 
		Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. 
		I'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again. 
		5-4-3-2-1...

	She starts over.

	INT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jordy's on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with
	his dog, ZACK.  Jordy's eyes are glazed.  He's drunk, his
	eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or
	Daphne. 
	His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. 
	As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
	seeps through her broadcast.

				NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
		Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
		descendent of the African King from whom
		he takes his name...

	Jordy's face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy
	picks up.

				JORDY
		Hello?
			(listens)
		No comment.

	He hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Hello?
			(listens)
		No!

	Jordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert
	Hawkins' face fills the screen.  He is standing across from
	someone - in a park - interviewing him.

				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
		He robbed you?

	The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
	suit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He
	stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
	tree.  He's appearing on "Top Story".

				ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
		That's right, I encountered him right
		here.  I was just askin' for change an'
		he whips out his big gun an' pushes me
		up against that tree, whereupon he takes
		my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'
		me there all exposed...

	The phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
	the table and throws it through the window:

	BACK TO TV

	as the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him
	is a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. 
	The reporter stands in front of the jail.

				REPORTER
		...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
		won't have to worry about how he is
		going to pay for his defense.  He has
		received movie offers and been in
		conversations with numerous publishers
		concerning the rights to his life story.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Oleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy.


	INT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

	Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see
	the TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He
	stares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head.

	EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

	Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the
	park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. 
	Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
	Rykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
	and sticks it in his pocket.

	CLOSE ON METER

	to $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.

				TAXI DRIVER
		I can't believe this guy got off. 
		Unbelievable.

	Jordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he
	crams it into the slot.

				JORDY
		Whatever's leftover, keep.

	Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is
	coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is
	sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with
	rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up
	and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand
	grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.

	HIGH WIDE SHOT

	Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. 
	All are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:

	HAWKINS

	and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
	frazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she
	looks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a
	disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -
	anxious - looks at his cameraman.

				HAWKINS
		He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he
		comes through the crowd.  Do you hear
		me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.

	THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP

	Cutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
	the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
	car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
	POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at
	Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:

				CUTLER
		...my client was suffering from a major
		illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
		during times of intense stress, as a
		result of paranoid and psychotic
		delusions - there was impairment of his
		ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
		This is a victory for the mentally ill!

	Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on
	Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,
	the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? 
	Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam
	in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
	cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
	place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler
	continues:

				CUTLER (CONT'D)
		...before Emil boards the police boat
		and heads for Rykers Island where he
		will be checked into the psyche ward, I
		want to say one last word to you all...
		As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
		Razgul into committing these murders,
		yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
		free man, filming gruesome murders... My
		client and I hope he is brought to
		justice in the near future.

	They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
	Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch
	obsessively.

				HAWKINS
		Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!

	Jordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. 
	Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts.

				JORDY
		You think this is funny??  What the hell
		are you laughing at?

	Emil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the
	jacket.

				CUTLER
			(to a nearby escort)
		Officer, keep this man back, he's
		assaulted my client on previous
		occasions.

	A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.

				JORDY
		This is it?  This bastard kills the best
		cop this city ever had and we do
		nothing?

				CUTLER
		You may not like it marshal, but that's
		the law.

				JORDY
		And what about the other victims??  What
		about their families?  He'll end up in
		some country club nuthouse while his
		lawyer sells his rights to the movies
		and we just stand here and do nothing? 
		We let this scumbag walk?

	Jordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. 
	Gets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly.

				EMIL
		Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm
		insane.

	Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the
	cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:

	A VIDEO POV

	as it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame
	tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who
	he's been waiting for.  His face lights up.

				HAWKINS
		I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where
		is it?  Where is the tape?

	IT'S OLEG

	In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.

				OLEG
		It's all in here.  All in here.

	MEANWHILE JORDY

	has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice
	cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:

				HAWKINS
		Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some
		interesting evidence, something you
		should look at!

	Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he
	continues introducing his broadcast:

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
		UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
		proving Emil Slovak was not insane! 
		Hard to believe...watch!

	Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
	videocamera up in the air.

				OLEG (ON VIDEO)
		He knew exactly what he was doing - all
		of this was planned!  It's all here in
		my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. 
		Look!

	Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
	of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:

				EMIL (ON VIDEO)
		...so we kill someone famous and if we
		are caught, we are sent to mental
		hospital...

				CUTLER
			(points to Oleg)
		Officers, there's your killer, do your
		duty, arrest him!

	The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
	reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the
	press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy
	notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE
	CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
	killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He
	yells at Oleg!

				EMIL
		Traitor!!

				OLEG
		No.  You are the traitor.  You are
		murderer.  I am director.  Action!

	Oleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:

	BANG!

	Oleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings
	his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. 
	Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
	escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He
	swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are
	screaming.  It's CHAOS.

	Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. 
	He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
	her head.

				CAPTAIN
		Drop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!

				EMIL
		I'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back
		away from me!

	We hear Jordy's voice above Emil.

				JORDY
		Let her go.  Let her fucking go!!

	The captain is screaming at all his men.

				CAPTAIN
		No one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do
		not fire!  No officer will fire his
		weapon unless I say so!
			(to Emil)
		Let the woman go!

	Cops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still
	aiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn't
	lowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.

				CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
		Holster your weapons!  Back away.  That
		is an order!  No officers will fire!

	Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
	Emil.

				EMIL
		Tell him to put his gun down!

				JORDY
		Let her go!  Let her go!!

				EMIL
		If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking
		kill her.

	Jordy doesn't lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The
	reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
	their lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! 
	Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.

				JORDY
		Let her go.

				NICOLETTE
		Shoot!  Shoot him!!

				EMIL
		Shut up!

	Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:

				CAPTAIN
		No on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer
		will follow.  No officer will shoot!

	Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.

				NICOLETTE
		Shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!

				EMIL
		Shut up!

	Everyone is screaming at once.  It's mass chaos.  The captain
	is trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with
	their weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still
	pointed at Emil. 
	Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.  He's
	pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to
	get the best coverage.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he
		lowers his gun.

	He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away
	towards the police boat.

				NICOLETTE
		Don't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot
		him!

	Jordy won't take his gun off him.

				JORDY
		Let her go.  Let her go.

	The captain is yelling at Jordy.

				CAPTAIN
		Lower your weapon.  I told you - lower
		your weapon!

	Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can't.  His
	heart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his
	weapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil
	laughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his
	weapon.

	JORDY SHOOTS

	Emil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the
	handcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
	he shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the
	shoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's
	chest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
	Emil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the
	ground.  Dead.  The captain yells.

				CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
		I told you not to shoot!  No officers
		should shoot.

	Jordy quietly answers:

				JORDY
		I'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.

				HAWKINS
		He's still alive.

	Hawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. 
	His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.

	OLEG'S VIDEO POV

	as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He
	looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:

				OLEG
		A film...by Oleg Razgul.

	And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins
	jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.

				OLEG (CONT'D)
		How was that?

	Oleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs
	over to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad
	Emil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.

				NICOLETTE
		Wait a minute.  Where are you going? 
		Learn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of
		public opinion.  Take the credit, you
		need it.

	She turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push
	the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.

				JORDY
		No thanks.

	Jordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's
	EDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. 
	She looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens
	pointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. 
	He doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want
	the fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because
	he was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.

				NICOLETTE
		Cut.

	Her cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. 
	Jordy turns and walks away.

				NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
		Get a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to
		me.

	Jordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS

   PROLOGUE

   Stagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily.
   Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night.

   Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles...

   And on through streets... Narrow.        Grimy.     Sooty.   Rank...
   Deserted...

   Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict
   buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading
   beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping
   fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined
   guttering...

   Moving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If
   anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken...

   And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can
   hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... "Take Me Back To
   Dear Ol' Blighty " as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone
   bar surrounded by drunken men...

   We keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint
   glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards
   it... Towards the piss-coloured light...

   We stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the
   music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we
   have is all we can see...

   The gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly
   from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it
   comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a
   flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of
   masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see
   figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a
   group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house...

   On the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal
   older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded
   up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair
   -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream
   plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in
   the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted...

   In the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden
   floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is
   OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece
   suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to
   us... Staring...

   Slightly behind, to his left, sitting nonchalantly cross-
   legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and
   casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette, is MEREDITH, late
   40's... Suave... Immaculate... Wearing black handmade boots, black
   Saville Row suit, black cashmere roll neck sweater, herring
   bone overcoat with a black velvet collar, brown leather
   gloves, his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined.... Behind
   him an old wardrobe...

   Standing with his back three quarters to us, and leaning on a
   broken, chipped, mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace
   is ARCHIE, aged 52... Big... Avuncular... Wearing a car coat and
   casual nondescript clothes... he is pouring himself a Captain
   Morgan's rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup... He sort
   of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks...

   Standing at the back of the room, in front of a door which             *
   has at some time been on fire, (it's yellowing, tobacco-ey
   paint charred and blistered), is MAL, aged mid-40's... Wearing
   a silver-grey suit, white shirt, duck-egg blue silk tie...

   There is another man in the room but we do not see his face --
   for he s its slu mpe d, h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he
   armchairs - a picture of despair. He wears an olive green
   shirt, brown trousers, maroon braces... This is COLIN, aged
   late 40's...

   Blackness and silence...

   In the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and
   tatty... Attached to skinny legs in black tights... The legs
   gangle and flip pulling into view a bony, pasty, bare torso
   which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head! - Long,
   lank, shoulder length hair... Dripping from a white domed pate
   - The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body-
   antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy, bulbous, rubbery...
   Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL!

   He goon-walks about for a bit in the black space... Baboon-
   bottomed... As if knees tied together... Aflickin' and akickin'
   his clown boots... His unhappy face... Like death... Prancing...
   Ridiculous dancing... Absurd...

   Giant C/U on his morose contorted phizzog...

    MUSIC... `WITHOUT YOU' by NILSSON...

    We are out of focus on purple... white... scattered sparkling
    "jewels"? begin to come into focus and we see that they are
    in fact pieces of broken glass... Thousands of splinters and
    shards strewn across a purple Wilton carpet... the white fur
    of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits... Ripped to shreds... In
    extreme C/U we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in
    mor e de bri s of d est ru ct io n... Sm as he d c ha ir s... Sm as he d
    photographs... Broken records... Ripped, shredded record
    sleeves -- `THE POWER OF LOVE' by JENNIFER RUSH -- `HOPELESSLY
    DEVOTED TO YOU' by OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN -- `I WILL ALWAYS LOVE
    YOU' by WHITNEY HOUSTON etc.

    The TV remote smashed to smithereens... The television --
    widescreen -- TOTALLED!... We move along the plush `World of
    Leather' leather sofa... See that a chunk has been bitten out
    of it... See teeth marks -- like a bite out of cheese!... Moving
    on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt... Approaching
    the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness
    underneath... We can just make out the quizzical, frightened
    eyes of a white poodle... We move on... Past twisted, wrecked
    lampshades... Broken plates, ornaments... An up-ended vase of
    half-eaten flowers... NILSSON continues his self-pitying
    overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive, masochistic
    chorus/crescendo we come across COLIN lying rigid on his back
    in the corner of the devastated room... His shocked eyes
    staring wildly... His body petrified. Paralysed... As if frozen
    at the height of an epileptic fit -- Like something from
    Pompeii -- Like Max Schrek as Nosferatu hit by light... We stay
    on COLIN... His uncomprehending terror-filled eyes... His sheer
    rigor mortis-like horror... We move in on him... Into the black
    of his eyes... The tragic, agonised black..

    We are outside, square on to an upstairs window of a detached
    suburban villa... We hear muffled sounds from inside the house...
    Yells... Screaming... Cries... Commotion... And suddenly the glass
    window explodes towards us as a desperate terrified woman
    comes crashing through... Having run full pelt to escape from
    something... This is LIZ, aged 44...

    Suddenly we hear ARCHIE'S voice ...

                 ... C'mon mate, you can't lie `ere forever!

    The rigid COLIN, ignoring him, has suddenly, belatedly,
    realised that the music has stopped... Desperately needing his
    friend, NILSSON -- like a man in excruciating pain reaching
    for a gallon of morphine, he frantically, urgently twists his
    body on the floor and reaching behind, hammers the play
    button on the nearby ghetto blaster... And slowly, gently,
    kindly, the piano intro of NILSSON'S gorgeous wallow re-
    commences... Colin, somewhat soothed, eases back into his
    former rigid, mortified position.

     BIGGY is staring with such hatred... we move in on his
     face... His hating face... we are close up... he stares just
     off camera... seems he is growling... low... primal growls...
     and now his hand, claw-like, comes into frame... he is
     reaching towards us... threatening-ly ... and slowly his
     hating eyes follow... and he is staring right at us...

12   INT ROOM IN DERELICT HOUSE   NIGHT                            12

     The room is as described in the prologue albeit with gable
     wall intact... MAL stands by the crumbling mantelpiece his
     back to the room... Touches the back of his head as if
     something has brushed against him... Over this we hear...

               ...Bells, aintcha?

     MAL glances over his shoulder... ARCHIE is crouching over and
     sorting through a card-board box containing various bottles
     of spirits...

     the armchairs... Opens the bottle...

     Slowly COLIN goes towards the figure... Stands in front of
     it... Stares at i t...

     Suddenly his hands grab at the black plastic- he roughly
     tears it open eventually revealing the bloody vest and pant-
     ed body ... Now he slowly lifts the crumpled Tesco bag from
     the head and we see the bowed, beaten face of LOVERBOY, early
     30's ... Eventually...

                            COLIN (CONT) (CONT'D)
                  You know-you're not a bad looking boy!..
                  Yeah, I can see the attraction!... Young
                  ... fit ... well built ... sexy ... but
                  if you don't mind my sayin' so - isn't it
                  all a bit obvious? Bit of a cliché? ...
                  (PAUSE) What was she doing? ... Silly cow
                  ... What a stupid woman!...

     COLIN slowly returns to his seat ... Uncaps the brandy ...
     Pours some into the cap and drinks it...

     His face is blank. Heartless. Matter of fact. Grizzled.
     Cold. His eyes dull. Black. Stony ... He is thick set... Bear-
     like... He wears a scruffy tweed coat ... A flat working man's
     cap a thick, battered gypsy belt-and he is busy bundling a
     live cockerel into the Hessian sack before him ... In with
     the snake ... In with the dog ... In with the man - the
     beaten, terrified, whimpering man in the sack...the four
     creatures in there together ... Pandemonium in the sack as he
     ties it off ... Brutishly dragging the hellish parcel to the
     edge of the pier-and lazily booting it into the dark sea
     below .. . He tur ns now . .. His task com pleted . .. And
     couldn't give a monkeys as he looks with zero compassion down
     the barrel of the camera at us... He walks off, disappearing
     into the foggy night ... This was BRIGHTON BILLY...

                aged 21, beautiful... Works in the
                city... Ray!... I love that name... Ray!...
                Met him in a sauna... he looked at me --
                I looked at him -- He looked at me...
                that sort of thing. Just clicked... Got
                talking... Learnt one or two things
                about each other... he can't swim -- I
                like cars, so on and so forth... Took
                it from there... We've been together
                three weeks now... Play it by ear...
                (pause)... Yesterday... he went off to
                work... I fancied a stroll... `opped on a
                bus... Hyde Park and I'm walkin'...
                Serpentine... Past the ducks... I see this
                rowing boat... man rowin',.. He turns...
                looks at me... still rowin'... It's him...
                It's Ray... The boyfriend... We don't
                acknowledge each other... and I just
                carry on walking... (pause)... Is he a
                liar or shouldn't I have been there?...
                What d'you reckon?... I know what I
                think!

                                   Revised Third Draft

                                      July 15, 1991

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --

               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

               SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.

               The drum cadence continues, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS

               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT

               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (quietly)
                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.

               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four 
               sharp blasts from a whistle and we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM 
               that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

               EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY

               It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS 
               enter and exit and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WOMAN

               as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                                     JO
                         I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, 
                         I'd like to request that I be the 
                         attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like 
                         to request that it be myself who is 
                         assigned to represent --
                              (she stops)
                         "That it be myself who is assigned 
                         to represent"? ...Good, Jo, that's 
                         confidence inspiring.

               We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick 
               building which bears the seal of the

                         Thank you, sir.

                         Captain West, this is Lt. Commander 
                         Galloway. Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir.
                              (to WEST)
                         Captain, I appreciate your seeing me 
                         on such short notice.

                         I understand there was some trouble 
                         over the weekend down in Cuba.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. They're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in 
                         Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What's the problem?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
                         poster marines and Santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a 
                         code red.

               Jo lets this sink in a moment.

                                     WEST
                              (under his breath)
                         Christ.

                                     JO
                         I'd like them moved up to Washington 
                         and assigned counsel. Someone who 
                         can really look into this. Someone 
                         who possesses not only the legal 
                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. In 
                         short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
                         that... I be the one who, that it be 
                         me who is assigned to represent them.
                              (beat)
                         Myself.

               Jo looks around the room for a response.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
                         cup of coffee.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, I'd like you to leave the 
                         room so we can talk about you behind 
                         your back.

                                     JO
                         Certainly, sir.

               JO gets up and walks out.

                         I thought this Code Red shit wasn't 
                         going on anymore.

                         hell knows what goes on down there.

                                     WEST
                         Well lets find out before the rest 
                         of the world does, this thing could 
                         get messy. What about this woman?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Jo's been working a desk at internal 
                         affairs for what, almost a year now.

                                     WEST
                         And before that?

                                     GIBBS
                         She disposed of three cases in two 
                         years.

                         Three cases in two years? Who was 
                         she handling, the Rosenbergs?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's not cut out for litigation.

                         She's a hall of an investigator, 
                         Jerry --

                                     GIBBS
                         In Internal Affairs, sure. She can 
                         crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
                         best of 'em, but when it comes to 
                         trial work --

                                     WEST
                         I know. All passion, no street smarts. 
                         Bring her back in.

               LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back 
               in.

                                     WEST
                              (continuing)
                         Commander, we're gonna move the 
                         defendants up here in the morning.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     WEST
                         And I'll have Division assign them 
                         counsel...

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         But... not me.

                                     WEST
                         From what I understand from your 
                         colleagues, you're much too valuable 
                         in your present assignment to be 
                         wasted on what I'm sure will boil 
                         down to a five minute plea bargain 
                         and a week's worth of paper work.

                                     JO
                         Sir --

                                     WEST
                         Don't worry about it. I promise you, 
                         division'll assign the right man for 
                         the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

               His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, 
               and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment 
               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (calling out to the 
                              team)
                         Alright, let's get two!

               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

                                     SECOND BASE
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  
                         Just look the ball into your glove.

               He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel 
               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

                                     SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep 
                         your eyes open, your chances of 
                         catching the ball increase by a factor 
                         of ten.

               SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, 
               walks up behind the backstop.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's try it again.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (turning)
                         Dave. You seem upset and distraught.

                                     SPRADLING
                         We were supposed to meet in your 
                         office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
                         the McDermott case. You're stalling 
                         on this thing. Now we got this done 
                         and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 
                         I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
                         yardarm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A yardarm?
                              (calling out)
                         Sherby, does the Navy still hang 
                         people from yardarms?

                                     SHERBY
                              (calling back)
                         I don't think so, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (back to SPRADLING)
                         Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy 
                         hangs people from yardarms anymore.
                              (back to the field)
                         Let's go, let's get two!

               He goes back to hitting fungoes.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I'm gonna charge him with possession 
                         and being under the influence while 
                         on duty. Plead guilty and I'll 
                         recommend 30 days in the brig with 
                         loss of rank and pay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was oregano, Dave, it was ten 
                         dollars worth of oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Yeah, well your client thought it 
                         was marijuana.

                                     KAFFEE
                         My client's a moron, that's not 
                         against the law.

               Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Ow. That had to hurt.
                              (calling out)
                         Way to keep your head in the play, 
                         Lester. Walk it off!

                                     SPRADLING
                         I've got people to answer to just 
                         like you, I'm gonna charge him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         With what, possession of a condiment?

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dave, I've tried to help you out of 
                         this, but if you ask for tall time, 
                         I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                                     SPRADLING
                         You won't got it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I will get it. And if the MTD is 
                         denied, I'll file a motion in liminee 
                         seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
                         in advance, and after that I'm gonna 
                         file against pre-trial confinement, 
                         and you're gonna spend an entire 
                         summer going blind on paperwork 
                         because a Signalman Second Class 
                         bought and smoked a dime bag of 
                         oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.

                                     KAFFEE
                         C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted 
                         duty.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I don't know why I'm agreeing to 
                         this.

                                     KAFFEE
                         'Cause you have wisdom beyond your 
                         years. Dave, can you play third base?

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) 
               are taking their seats around a large conference table.

               A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers 
               to the LAWYERS.

               We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior 
               Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If 
               he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval 
               officer.

               CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in.

                                     WHITAKER
                         'Morning.

                                     LAWYERS
                              (school class)
                         'Morning Captain Whitaker.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam, how's the baby?

                                     SAM
                         I think she's ready to say her first 
                         word any day now.

                                     WHITAKER
                         How can you tell?

                                     SAM
                         She just looks like she has something 
                         to say.

               KAFFEE walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

                                     WHITAKER
                         I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
                         so I won't force you to come up with 
                         a bad one.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of 
                         you.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sit-down, this first one's for you.

               He hands KAFFEE some files.

                                     WHITAKER
                              (continuing)
                         You're moving up in the world, Danny, 
                         you've been requested by Division.

               "Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: 
               Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

                                     KAFFEE
                         Requested to do what?

               WHITAKER hands him a file.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine 
                         corporal named Dawson illegally fires 
                         a round from his weapon over the 
                         fenceline and into Cuban territory.

                         PFC William Santiago threatens to 
                         rat on Dawson to the Naval 
                         investigative Service. Dawson and 
                         another member of his squad, PFC 
                         Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's 
                         room, tie him up, and stuff a rag 
                         down his throat. An hour later, 
                         Santiago's dead. Attending physician 
                         says the rag was treated with some 
                         kind of toxin.

                         to Cuba for the day to find out what 
                         you can. Meantime, go across the 
                         yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne 
                         Galloway. She's the one who had 'em 
                         brought up here. She'll fill you in

               INT. JO'S OFFICE - DAY

               JO sits behind her desk. KAFFEE and SAM stand in the doorway. 
               KAFFEE knocks politely.

               JO looks up.

                         Hi.
                              (beat)
                         I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to 
                         meet with --
                              (checks notes)
                         -- Commander Galloway.

               JO is staring at him. KAFFEE doesn't know why.

                              (continuing)
                         About a briefing.

               JO is finding this hard to believe.

                         You're the attorney that Division

                         I'm lead counsel. This is Sam 
                         Weinberg.

                         I have no responsibilities here

                         Going on nine months now.

                         Have I done something wrong?

                                     JO
                         No. It's just that when I petitioned 
                         Division to have counsel assigned, I 
                         was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

               KAFFEE and SAM exchange a look.

                         Commander, from what I understand, 
                         if this thing goes to court, they 
                         won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
                         priest.

                                     JO
                         No. They'll need a lawyer.

               During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which 
               KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Dawson's family has been contacted.  
                         Downey's closest living relative is 
                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side, she hasn't been Contacted yet.

               None of this really means anything to KAFFEE.

                         You haven't talked to a witness, you 
                         haven't looked at a piece of paper.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Pretty impressive, huh?

                                     JO
                         You're gonna have to go deeper than 
                         just --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, do you have some sort of 
                         jurisdiction here that I should know 
                         about?

                                     JO
                         My job is to make sure you do your 
                         job. I'm special counsel for Internal 
                         Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty 
                         much in your face. Read the letters. 
                         You're not under any obligation, but 
                         I'd appreciate a report when you get 
                         back from Cuba.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sure.

               KAFFEE gets up without waiting for JO to say --

                                     JO
                         You're dismissed.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sorry, I always forget that.

               KAFFEE's gone. SAM's standing in the doorway.

                                     SAM

                         down there.  The marines in Guantanimo 
                         are fanatical.

               And in VOICE OVER we HEAR --

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         Dear Sir,

                                     JO
                         About being marines.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CUBAN FIELD - DAY

               SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

               And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing 
               is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 
               months. He had a rough time of it.

               THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:

               -- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.  
               It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A 
               SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him 
               to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get 
               back up and keep running, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being 
               supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits 
               the mud every time down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MESS HALL - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend 
               within four seats of him and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his 
               squad and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this 
               time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like 
               he's gonna pass out.

               He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him 
               down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over 
               this, we HEAR

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "...My name is PFC William T. 
                         Santiago. I am a marine stationed at 
                         Marine Barracks, Rifle Security 
                         Company Windward, Second Platoon 
                         Delta. I am writing to inform you of 
                         my problems with my unit here in 
                         Cuba and to ask for your help. I've 
                         fallen out on runs before for several 
                         reasons such as feeling dizzy or 
                         nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen 
                         back about 20 or 30 yards going down 
                         a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
                         grabbed me and pushed me down the 
                         hill. Then I saw all black and the 
                         last thing I remember is hitting the 
                         deck. I was brought to the hospital 
                         where I was told I just had heat 
                         exhaustion and was explained to by 
                         the doctor that my body has trouble 
                         with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. 
                         I ask you to help me. Please sir. I 
                         just need to be transferred out of 
                         RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. 
                         Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps."

               At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  JESSEP'S OFFICE - DAY

               THE LETTER - DAY

               It's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing, 
               and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding 
               it.

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "P.S. In exchange for my transfer 
                         off the base, I'm willing to provide 
                         you with information about an illegal 
                         fenceline shooting that occurred the 
                         night of August 2nd."

               And as these last words are spoken, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
               COLONEL NATHAN R. JESSEP, who drops the letter he's been 
               reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters 
               just like it.

               JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one 
               of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a 
               whip with a sense of humor to match. As soon as he drops the 
               letter, he says

                                     JESSEP
                         Who the fuck is PFC William T. 
                         Santiago.

               He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON 
               is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in 
               a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure 
               as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 
               26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

               If you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are 
               guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sir, Santiago is a member of Second 
                         Platoon, Delta.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yeah, well, apparently he's not very 
                         happy down here at Shangri-La, cause 
                         he's written letters to everyone but 
                         Santa Claus asking for a transfer. 
                         And now he's telling tales about a 
                         fenceline shooting.

               He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON. MARKINSON is looking 
               it over. JESSEP is waiting for a response.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I'm appalled, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         You're appalled? This kid broke the 
                         Chain of Command and he ratted on a 
                         man of his unit, to say nothing of 
                         the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and 
                         it would appear that he can't run 
                         from here to there without collapsing 
                         from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's 
                         going on over at Windward, Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Colonel, I think perhaps it would be 
                         better to hold this discussion in 
                         private.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That won't be necessary, Colonel, 
                         I'll handle the situation.

                                     MARKINSON
                         The same way you handled the Curtis 
                         Barnes incident? You're doing 
                         something wrong, Lieutenant this --

                                     KENDRICK
                         My methods of leadership are --

                                     MARKINSON
                         Don't interrupt me, I'm still your 
                         superior officer.

                                     JESSEP
                         And I'm yours, Matthew.

               The room calms down for a moment.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         I want to know what we're gonna do 
                         about this.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think Santiago should be transferred 
                         off the base. Right away.

                                     JESSEP
                         He's that bad, huh?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Not only that, but word of this 
                         letter's bound to get out. The kid's 
                         gonna get his ass kicked.

                                     JESSEP
                         Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose 
                         you're right. I suppose that's the 
                         thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a 
                         better idea. Let's transfer the whole 
                         squad off the base. Let's -- on second 
                         thought -- Windward. The whole 
                         Windward division, let's transfer 
                         'em off the base. Jon, go on out 
                         there and get those boys down off 
                         the fence, they're packing their 
                         bags.
                              (calling out)
                         Tom!

               The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Got me the President on the phone, 
                         we're surrendering our position in 
                         Cuba.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Yes sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Wait a minute, Tom.

               The ORDERLY stops.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Don't call the President just yet. 
                         Maybe we should consider this for a 
                         second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit 
                         balling here -- but maybe we as 
                         officers have a responsibility to 
                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers 
                         have a responsibility to this country 
                         to see that the men and women charged 
                         with its security are trained 
                         professionals. Yes. I'm certain I 
                         once read that somewhere. And now 
                         I'm thinking that your suggestion of 
                         transferring Santiago, while 
                         expeditious, and certainly painless, 
                         might not be in a manner of speaking, 
                         the American way. Santiago stays 
                         where he is. We're gonna train the 
                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
                         report, I'm gonna blame you. Then 
                         I'm gonna kill you.

                         Yes sir.

                         I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                         Matthew, I believe I will have that 
                         word in private with you now. Jon, 
                         that's all. Why don't you and I have 
                         lunch at the "O" club, we'll talk 
                         about the training of young William.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear 
                         any suggestions you have.

                                     JESSEP
                         Dismissed.

               KENDRICK is gone.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew, sit, please.

               MARKINSON sits.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         What do you think of Kendrick?

                                     MARKINSON
                              (beat)
                         I don't know that --

                                     JESSEP
                         I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. 
                         But he's an awfully good officer, 
                         and in the end we see eye to eye on 
                         the best way to run a marine corps 
                         unit. We're in the business of saving 
                         lives, Matthew. That's a 
                         responsibility we have to take pretty 
                         seriously. And I believe that taking 
                         a marine who's not yet up to the job 
                         and packing him off to another 
                         assignment, puts lives in danger.

               MARKINSON starts to stand --

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)

                              (beat)
                         We go back a while. We went to the 
                         Academy together, we were commissioned 
                         together, we did our tours in Vietnam 
                         together. But I've been promoted up 
                         through the chain with greater speed 
                         and success than you have. Now if 
                         that's a source of tension or 
                         embarrassment for you, well, I don't 
                         give a shit. We're in the business 
                         of saving lives, Captain Markinson. 
                         Don't ever question my orders in 
                         front of another officer.

               JESSEP grabs his hat and walks out, leaving MARKINSON sitting 
               all alone, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - MAIN GATE - DAY

               It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday. An 
               M.P. is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans 
               and a fourth unmarked car through the gate. The cars drive 
               through and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BRIG - DAY

               Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as 
               the cars pull up. As soon as they come to a stop, all the 
               doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed 
               officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they 
               escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.  
               HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense, 
               controlled, and utterly professional.

               LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's 
               happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.

               DAWSON's his hero.

               The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as 
               we'll be in Oz.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

               DAWSON doesn't say anything.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
                         Is this Washington, D.C.?

                                     M.P.
                         Alright, let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               and KAFFEE's at it again.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright, let's get tough out there!

               JO walks up from behind the backstop.

                                     JO
                         Excuse me.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You want to suit up? We need all the 
                         help we can get.

                                     JO
                         No, thank you, I can't throw and 
                         catch things.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's okay, neither can they.

                                     JO
                         I wanted to talk to you about Corporal 
                         Dawson and Private Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Say again?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Those names sound like they should 
                         mean something to me, but I'm just 
                         not --

                                     JO
                         Dawson! Downey! Your clients!

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and 
                         Downey.
                              (beat)
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         I've done something wrong again, 
                         haven't I?

                                     JO
                         I was wondering why two guys have 
                         been in a jail cell since this morning 
                         while their lawyer is outside hitting 
                         a ball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We need the practice.

                                     JO
                         That wasn't funny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was a little funny.

                                     JO
                         Lieutenant, would you feel very 
                         insulted if I recommended to your 
                         supervisor that he assign different 
                         counsel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JO
                         I don't think you're fit to handle 
                         this defense.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't even know me. Ordinarily 
                         it takes someone hours to discover 
                         I'm not fit to handle a defense.

               Jo just stares.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh come on, that was damn funny.

               Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of 
               confidentiality.

                                     JO
                         I do know you. Daniel AlliStair 
                         Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston 
                         Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel 
                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate 
                         and Attorney General, of the United 
                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard 
                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably 
                         because that's what your father wanted 
                         you to do, and now you're just 
                         treading water for the three years 
                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, 
                         just kinda layin' low til you can 
                         get out and get a real job. And if 
                         that's the situation, that's fine, I 
                         won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
                         that if this case is handled in the 
                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
                         handle everything else, something's 
                         gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
                         doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
                         Downey to spend any more time in 
                         prison than absolutely necessary, 
                         because their attorney had pre-
                         determined the path of least 
                         resistance.

               KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Wow.

                         I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

                         I don't think your clients murdered 
                         anybody.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you basing this on?

                                     JO
                         There was no intent.

                         The doctor's report says that Santiago 
                         died of asphyxiation brought on by 
                         acute lactic acidosis, and that the 
                         nature of the acidosis strongly 
                         suggests poisoning.
                              (beat)
                         Now, I don't know what any of that 
                         means, but it sounds pretty bad.

                                     JO
                         Santiago died at one a.m. At three 
                         the doctor was unable to determine 
                         the cause of death, but two hours 
                         later he said it was poison.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Oh, now I see what you're saying.  
                         It had to be Professor Plum in the 
                         library with the candlestick.

                                     JO
                         I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania 
                         Avenue. It's a big white house with 
                         pillars in front.

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't think you'll have much luck, 
                         though. I was assigned by Division, 
                         remember? Somebody over there thinks 
                         I'm a good lawyer. So while I 
                         appreciate your interest and admire 
                         your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty 
                         much handle things myself.

                         Do you know what a code red is?

               KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         What a pity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BRIG - DAY

               And an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY's cell.

                         Officer on deck, ten-hut.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention. Through the following, 
               the M.P. will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in.

                         Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, 
                         sir. Rifle Security Company Windward, 
                         Second Platoon, Delta.

                         Someone hasn't been working and 
                         playing well with others, Harold.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, yes sir!

                         Sir, PFC Louden Downey.

                         I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam 
                         Weinerg, you can sitdown.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY aren't too comfortable sitting in the 
               presence of officers, but they do as they're told. KAFFEE's 
               pulled out some documents, SAM's sitting on one of the cots 
               taking notes.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; to DAWSON)
                         Is this your signature?

                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't have to call me sir.
                              (to DOWNEY)
                         Is this your signature?

                         Sir, yes sir.

                         And you certainly don't have to do 
                         it twice in one sentence. Harold, 
                         what's a Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary 
                         engagement.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does that mean, exactly?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a marine falls out of line, 
                         it's up to the men in his unit to 
                         get him back on track.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's a garden variety Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, you say sir and I turn around 
                         and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, 
                         Kaffee. Garden variety; typical. 
                         What's a basic Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a marine has refused to bathe 
                         on a regular basis. The men in his 
                         squad would give him a G.I. shower.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's that?

                                     DAWSON
                         Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel 
                         wool...

                         Beautiful.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was the attack on Santiago a Code 
                         Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DOWNEY)
                         Do you ever talk?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, Private Downey will answer any 
                         direct questions you ask him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Swell. Private Downey, the rag you 
                         stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was 
                         there poison on it?

                                     DOWNEY
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Silver polish, turpentine, anti-
                         freeze...

                                     DOWNEY
                         No sir. We were gonna shave his head, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When all of a sudden...?

                                     DOWNEY
                         We saw blood drippinq out of his 
                         mouth. Then we pulled the tape off, 
                         and there was blood all down his 
                         face, sir. That's when Corporal Dawson 
                         called the ambulance.

               KAFFEE tries not to make too big a deal out of this last 
               piece of news.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DAWSON)
                         Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you there when the ambulance 
                         got there?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir, that's when we were taken 
                         under arrest.

               KAFFEE kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for 
               a moment.

                                     SAM
                              (to DAWSON)
                         On the night of August 2nd, did you 
                         fire a shot across the fenceline 
                         into Cuba?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     SAM
                         Why?

                                     DAWSON
                         My mirror engaged, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         His mirror engaged?

                                     SAM
                         For each American sentry post there's 
                         a Cuban counterpart. They're called 
                         mirrors. The corporal's claiming 
                         that his mirror was about to fire at 
                         him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago's letter to the NIS said 
                         you fired illegally. He's saying 
                         that the guy, the mirror, he never 
                         made a move.

               DAWSON says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, Harold?

               SAM is staring at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You see what I'm getting at? If 
                         Santiago didn't have anything on 
                         you, then why did you give him a 
                         Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Because he broke the chain of command, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He what?

                                     DAWSON
                         He went outside his unit, sir. If he 
                         had a problem, he should've spoken 
                         to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then 
                         Company Commander, then --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you 
                         assault Santiago with the intent of 
                         killing him?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What was your intent?

                                     DAWSON
                         To train him, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Train him to do what?

                                     DAWSON
                         Train him to think of his unit before 
                         himself. To respect the code.

                                     SAM
                         What's the code?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country.

                                     SAM
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Goverrment of the United States 
                         wants to charge you two with murder. 
                         You want me to go to the prosecutor 
                         with unit, corps, god, country?

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE.

                                     DAWSON
                         That's our code, sir.

               KAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he 
               and SAM move to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll be back. You guys need anything? 
                         Books paper, cigarettes, a ham 
                         sandwich?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir. No thank you. Sir.

               KAFFEE smiles at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I think there's a concept 
                         you better start warming up to.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm the only friend you've got.

               And as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute.

               They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of 
               sight, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY

               He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the 
               work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years 
               older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in..

                         You think so?

                         I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake 
                         you practice law better than you 
                         play softball.

                         Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, 
                         I don't do anything better than I 
                         play softball. What are we lookin' 
                         at?

                                     ROSS
                         They plead guilty to manslaughter, 
                         I'll drop the conspiracy and the 
                         conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll 
                         be home in half that time.

                         I want twelve.

                                     ROSS
                         Can't do it.

                         They called the ambulance, Jack.

                                     ROSS
                         I don't care if they called the Avon 
                         Lady, they killed a marine.

                         The rag was tested for poison.  The 
                         autopsy, lab report, even the initial 
                         E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all 
                         say the same thing: Maybe, maybe 
                         not.

                         What do you know about Code Reds?

               ROSS smiles and shakes his head.

                                     ROSS
                         Oh man.

               He closes the office door.

                         Are we off the record?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tell me.

                                     ROSS
                              (pause)
                         I'm gonna give you the twelve years, 
                         but before you go getting yourself 
                         into trouble tomorrow, you should 
                         know this: The platoon commander Lt. 
                         Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting 
                         with the men. And he specifically 
                         told them not to touch Santiago.

               KAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to 
               mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to you when I get back.

                         Hey, we got a little four-on-four 
                         going tomorrow night. When does your 
                         plane get in?

               It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work.  
               We can see the flag being lowered in the background.

               KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts 
               walking along with him.

                                     JO
                         Hi there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any luck getting me replaced?

                                     JO
                         Is there anyone in this command that 
                         you don't either drink or play 
                         softball with?

                         Listen, I came to make peace. We 
                         started off on the wrong foot. What 
                         do you say? Friends?

                         By the way, I brought Downey some 
                         comic books he was asking for. The 
                         kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't 
                         know where he is, he doesn't even 
                         know why he's been arrested.

                         Yes.

                         Jo, if you ever speak to a client of 
                         mine again without my permission, 
                         I'll have you disbarred. Friends?

                                     JO
                         I had authorization.

                                     KAFFEE
                         From where?

                                     JO
                         Downey's closest living relative, 
                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

                                     JO
                         I gave her a call like you asked. 
                         Very nice woman, we talked for about 
                         an hour.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

                                     JO
                         Perfectly within my province.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can 
                         hold the trial there. I can sew the 
                         costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober 
                         can be the judge.

               Jo steps aside and lets KAFFEE got into his car.

                                     JO
                         I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

                         And the hits just keep on comin'.

               HOLD on KAFFEE and Jo. JO smiles.

               He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a 
               sidewalk newsstand.

               He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and 
               runs up to the newsstand.

               As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he 
               engages in his daily ritual with LUTHER, the newsstand 
               operator.

               INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               A baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal SAM is standing 
               over the crib. KAFFEE's sitting on a beer.

                                     SAM
                         When Nancy gets back, you're my 
                         witness. The baby spoke. My daughter 
                         said a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm 
                         not sure it was a word.

                                     SAM
                         Oh come on, it was a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay.

                                     SAM
                         You heard her. The girl sat here, 
                         pointed, and said "Pa". She did. She 
                         said "Pa".

                                     KAFFEE
                         She was pointing at a doorknob.

                                     SAM
                         That's right. Pointing, as if to 
                         say, "Pa, look, a doorknob".

               SAM joins KAFFEE in the living room.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack Ross came to see me today. He 
                         offered me twelve years.

                                     SAM
                         That's what you wanted.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean --
                              (beat)
                         I'll take it.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It took albout 45 seconds. He barely 
                         put up a fight.

                                     SAM
                              (beat)
                         Danny, take the twelve years, it's a 
                         gift.

               KAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't believe their story, do 
                         you? You think they ought to go to 
                         jail for the rest of their lives.

                                     SAM
                         I believe every word they said. And 
                         I think they ought to go to jail for 
                         the rest of their lives.

               KAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the 
               stoop for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         Remember to wear your whites, it's 
                         hot down there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't like the whites.

                                     SAM
                         Nobody likes the whites, but we're 
                         going to Cuba in August. You got 
                         Dramamine?

                         Dramamine keeps you cool?

                                     SAM
                         Dramamine keeps you from throwing 
                         up, you get sick when you fly.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I get sick when I fly because I'm 
                         afraid of crashing into a large 
                         mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll 
                         help.

                                     SAM
                         I've got some oregano, I hear that 
                         works pretty good.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, right.

               KAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You know, Ross said the strangest 
                         thing to me right before I left. He 
                         said the platoon commander Lieutenant 
                         Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with 
                         the men and specifically told them 
                         not to touch Santiago.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't 
                         even know who he is.
                              (beat)
                         What the hell.
                              (beat)
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               We hold for a moment on KAFFEE as he walks to his car, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE AIRSTRIP AT GUANTANAMO BAY - DAY

               The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy 
               Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac. 
               Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity.

               A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a 
               stair unit is brought up.

               HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the 
               passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, 
               a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and 
               SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.

               KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in 
               Kansas anymore.

               HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes.

                                     HOWARD
                         Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         Yeah.

                                     JO
                         Commander Galloway.

                                     HOWARD
                         I'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, I'm to 
                         escort you to the Windward side of 
                         the base.

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     HOWARD
                         I've got some camouflage jackets in 
                         the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll 
                         have to ask you both to put them on.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Camouflage jackets?

                                     HOWARD
                         Regulations, sir. We'll be riding 
                         pretty close to the fenceline. The 
                         Cubans see an officer wearing white, 
                         they think it's someone they might 
                         wanna take a shot at.

               KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Good call, Sam.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CUBAN ROAD - THE JEEP - DAY

               Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful 
               expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of 
               Guantanamo Bay.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         We'll just hop on the ferry and be 
                         over there in no time.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?!

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir, to get to the other side of 
                         the bay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nobody said anything about a boat.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         Is there a problem, sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         No. No problem. I'm just not that 
                         crazy about boats, that's all.

                                     JO
                              (shouting)
                         Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the 
                         Navy for cryin' out loud!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         Nobody likes her very much.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         Yes sir.

               JESSEP, MARKINSON and KENDRICK are standing as the LAWYERS 
               are led in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you. I'm Daniel Kaffee, I'm 
                         the attorney for Dawson and Downey. 
                         This is Joanne Galloway, she's 
                         observing and evaluating --

                         Pleased to meet you, Commander.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility 
                         here whatsoever.

                                     JESSEP
                         I've asked Captain Markinson and Lt.  
                         Kendrick to join us.

                                     MARKINSON
                         Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of 
                         seeing your father once. I was a 
                         teenager and he spoke at my high 
                         school.

               KAFFEE smiles and nods.

                                     JESSEP
                         Lionel Kaffee?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Well what do you know. Son, this 
                         man's dad once made a lot of enemies 
                         down in your neck of the woods. 
                         Jefferson vs. Madison County School 
                         District. The folks down there said 
                         a little black girl couldn't go to 
                         an all white school, Lionel Kaffee 
                         said we'll just see about that. How 
                         the hell is your dad?

                                     KAFFEE
                         He passed away seven years ago, 
                         colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Well... don't I feel like the fuckin, 
                         asshole.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not at all, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Well, what can we do for you, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid. 
                         This is really a formality more than 
                         anything else. The JAG Corps insists 
                         that I interview all the relevant 
                         witnesses.

                                     JO
                         The JAG Corps can be demanding that 
                         way.

               JESSEP smiles.

                                     JESSEP
                         Jonanthan'll take you out and show 
                         you what you wanna see, then we can 
                         all hook up for lunch, how does that 
                         sound?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fine, sir.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  THE FENCELINE - DAY

               A SQUAD OF MARINES jogs by as a jeep carrying KENDRICK and 
               the three LAWYERS cruises down the road.

               We FOLLOW the jeep.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I understand you had a meeting with 
                         your men that afternoon.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What'd you guys talk about?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I told the men that there was an 
                         informer among us. And that despite 
                         any desire they might have to seek 
                         retribution, Private Santiago was 
                         not to be harmed in any way.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What time was that meeting?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sixteen-hundred.

               KAFFEE turns around and looks at SAM.

                                     SAM
                              (leaning forward)
                         Four o'clock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR - DAY

               KENDRICK leads the LAWYERS down the corridor to Santiago's 
               room.

               Two strips of tape which warn DO NOT ENTER - AT ORDER OF THE 
               MILITARY POLICE are crisscrossed over the closed door. They 
               open the door and step under the tape and walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - DAY

               The room is exactly an it was left that night. The un-made 
               bed, the chair knocked over... The LAWYERS look around for a 
               moment. The room is sparse.

               Kaffee goes to the closet and opens it: A row of uniforms 
               hanging neatly. He thumbs through then for a second, but 
               there's nothing there.

               He opens the footlocker: Socks, underwear... all folded to 
               marine corp precision... A shaving kit, a couple of 
               photographs, a pad of writing paper and some envelopes...

               Kaffee closes the footlocker.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, somebody should see about getting 
                         this stuff to his parents. We don't 
                         need it anymore.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Actually, the uniforms belong to the 
                         marine corps.

               The LAWYERS take a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lt. Kendrick -- can I call you Jon?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, you may not.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Have I done something to offend you?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, I like all you Navy boys. Every 
                         time we've gotta go someplace and 
                         fight, you fellas always give us a 
                         ride.

                                     JO
                         Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago 
                         was murdered?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Commander, I believe in God, and in 
                         his son Jesus Christ, and because I 
                         do, I can say this: Private Santiago 
                         is dead and that's a tragedy. But 
                         he's dead because he had no code. 
                         He's dead because he had no honor. 
                         And God was watching.

               SAM turns to KAFFEE.

                                     SAM
                         How do you feel about that theory?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Sounds good. Let's move on.

               SAM and KENDRICK walk out the door. JO stops KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                         You planning on doing any 
                         investigating or are you just gonna 
                         take the guided tour?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         I'm pacing myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - DAY

               JESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a 
               table in the corner.

               Stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. Jessep is 
               finishing a story.

                                     JESSEP
                         ...And they spent the next three 
                         hours running around, looking for 
                         Americans to surrender to.

               JESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a 
               laugh.

               MARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to the 
                              STEWARDS)
                         That was delicious, men, thank you.

                                     STEWARD
                         Our pleasure, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel just need to ask you a couple 
                         of questions about August 6th.

                                     JESSEP
                         Shoot.

                                     KAFFEE
                         On the morning of the sixth, you 
                         were contacted by an NIS angent who 
                         said that Santiago had tipped him 
                         off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago was gonna reveal the person's 
                         name in exchange for a transfer. An 
                         I getting this right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If you feel there are any details 
                         that I'm missing, you should free to 
                         speak up.

               JESSEP's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer 
               Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak 
               freely on his own base.

                                     JESSEP
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Now it was at this point that you 
                         called Captain Markinson and Lt. 
                         Kendrick into your office?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And what happened then?

                                     JESSEP
                         We agreed that for his own safety, 
                         Santiago should be transferred off 
                         the base.

               Here's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo. 
               SAM jots something down on a small notepad.

               MARKINSON doesn't flinch.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago was set to be transferred?

                                     JESSEP
                         On the first available flight to the 
                         states. Six the next morning. Three 
                         hours too late as it turned out.

               KAFFEE nods.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.

               There's silence for a moment.

               KAFFEE takes a sip of his coffee. Then drains the cup and 
               puts it down.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Alright, that's all I have. Thanks 
                         very much for your time.

                                     KENDRICK
                         The corporal's got the jeep outside, 
                         he'll take you back to the airstrip.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (standing)
                         Thank you.

                                     JO
                         Wait a minute, I've got some 
                         questions.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No you don't.

                                     JO
                         Yes I do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No you don't.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, on the morning that Santiago 
                         died, did you meet with Doctor Stone 
                         between three and five?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo --

                                     JESSEP
                         Of course I met with the doctor. One 
                         of my men was dead.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
                         See? The man was dead. Let's go.

                                     JO
                              (to JESSEP)
                         I was wondering if you've ever heard 
                         the term Code Red.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo --

                                     JESSEP
                         I've heard the term, yes.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, this past February, you 
                         received a cautionary memo from the 
                         Naval Investigative Service, warning 
                         that the practice of enlisted men 
                         disciplining their own wasn't to be 
                         condoned by officers.

                                     JESSEP
                         I submit to you that whoever wrote 
                         that memo has never served on the 
                         working end of a Soviet-made Cuban 
                         Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the 
                         directive having come from the NIS, 
                         I gave it its due attention. What's 
                         your point, Jo?

                                     KAFFEE
                         She has no point. She often has no 
                         point. It's part of her charm. We're 
                         outta here. Thank you.

                                     JO
                         My point is that I think code reds 
                         still go on down here. Do Code Reds 
                         still happen on this base, colonel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer 
                         that.

                                     JO
                         Yes he does.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No, he really doesn't.

                                     JO
                         Yeah, he really does. Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         You know it just hit me. She outranks 
                         you, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         I want to tell you something Danny 
                         and listen up 'cause I mean this: 
                         You're the luckiest man in the world. 
                         There is, believe me gentlemen, 
                         nothing sexier on earth than a woman 
                         you have to salute in the morning. 
                         Promote 'em all I say.

               JO's not upset. JO's not mad. But she's gonna ask her question 
               'til she gets an answer.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, the practice of code Reds 
                         is still condoned by officers on 
                         this base, isn't it?

                                     JESSEP
                         You see my problem is, of course, 
                         that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have 
                         to keep taking cold showers 'til 
                         they elect some gal President.

                                     JO
                         I need an answer to my question, 
                         sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Take caution in your tone, Commander.  
                         I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' 
                         heat's making me absolutely crazy. 
                         You want to know about code reds?  
                         On the record I tell you that I 
                         discourage the practice in accordance 
                         with the NIS directive. Off the record 
                         I tell you that it's an invaluable 
                         part of close infantry training, and 
                         if it happens to go on without my 
                         knowledge, so be it. I run my base 
                         how I run my base. You want to 
                         investigate me, roll the dice and 
                         take your chances. I eat breakfast 
                         80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who 
                         are trained to kill me. So don't for 
                         one second think you're gonna come 
                         down here, flash a badge, and make 
                         me nervous.

               A moment of tense silence before --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a 
                         copy of Santiago's transfer order.

                                     JESSEP
                         What's that?

                         Santiago's transfer order. You guys 
                         have paper work on that kind of thing, 
                         I just need it for the file.

                                     JESSEP
                         For the file.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Of course you can have a copy of the 
                         transfer order. For the file. I'm 
                         here to help anyway I can.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

                                     JESSEP
                         You believe that, don't you? Danny? 
                         That I'm here to help anyway I can?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Of course.

                                     JESSEP
                         The corporal'll run you by Ordinance 
                         on your way out to the airstrip. You 
                         can have all the transfer orders you 
                         want.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO and SAM)
                         Let's go.

               The LAWYERS start to leave.

                                     JESSEP
                         But you have to ask me nicely.

               KAFFEE stops. Turns around. Sam and JO stop and turn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     JESSEP
                         You have to ask me nicely. You see, 
                         Danny, I can deal with the bullets 
                         and the bombs and the blood. I can 
                         deal with the heat and the stress 
                         and the fear. I don't want money and 
                         I don't want medals. What I want is 
                         for you to stand there in that faggoty 
                         white uniform, and with your Harvard 
                         mouth, extend me some fuckin' 
                         courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely.

               KAFFEE and JESSEP are frozen. Everyone'staring at Kaffee; 
               The OFFICERS at their tables... KENDRICK... SAM... 
               MARKINSON... JO... KAFFEE makes his decision.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel Jessep... if it's not too 
                         much trouble, I'd like a copy of the 
                         transfer order. Sir.

               JESSEP smiles.

                                     JESSEP
                         No problem.

               HOLD for a moment. JO's very disappointed.

               JESSEP stands there and watches the LAWYERS as they turn and 
               leave the Officer's Club.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         I hate casualties, Matthew. There 
                         are casualties even in victory. A 
                         marine smothers a grenade and saves 
                         his platoon, that marine's a hero. 
                         The foundation of the unit, the fabric 
                         of this base, the spirit of the Corps, 
                         they are things worth fighting for.

               MARKINSON looks at the ground.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Dawson and Downey, they don't know 
                         it, but they're smothering a grenade.

               MARKINSON looks up as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANDREWS AIRFORCE BASE - DUSK

               As a plane touches down on the runway. It's dusk in Washington 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               A little one-bedroom. Just the essential furniture, barely 
               even that.

               KAFFEE's sitting and watching a baseball came on t.v. He's 
               holding a copy of The Baseball Encyclopedia, normally his 
               favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble 
               keeping his mind in it. He's holding a baseball bat and 
               fiddling with it.

               The remnants of a pizza and Yoo-Hoo dinner sit next to him.  
               His white uniform in a pile in the corner. There's a BUZZ at 
               the door. KAFFEE's not expecting anyone. He goes to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Who is it?

                                     JO (O.S.)
                         It's me.

               KAFFEE opens the door and JO walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've really missed you, Jo. I was 
                         just saying to myself, "It's been 
                         almost three hours since I last saw --
                         "

                                     JO
                         Markinson resigned his commission.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         When?

                                     JO
                         This afternoon. Sometime after we 
                         left.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to him in the morning.

                                     JO
                         I already tried, I can't find him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tried? Joanne, you're coming 
                         dangerously close to the textbook 
                         definition of interfering with a 
                         government investigation.

               JO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding.

                                     JO
                         I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

               KAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like 
                         she's known me for years. I suggested 
                         that she might feel more comfortable 
                         if I were directly involved with the 
                         case. She had Louden sign the papers 
                         about an hour ago.

               KAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then 
               finally...

                                     KAFFEE
                         I suppose it's way too much to hope 
                         that you're just making this up to 
                         bother me.

                                     JO
                         Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a 
                         motion for separation, you're still 
                         lead counsel.

               KAFFEE hands her back the file.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Splendid.

                                     JO
                         I think Kendrick ordered the Code 
                         Red.
                              (beat)
                         So do you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A HOLDING ROOM IN THE BRIG - NIGHT

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention as KAFFEE and JO are led 
               in.

                                     DAWSON
                         Officer on deck, ten hut.

               KAFFEE starts in immediately.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did Kendrick order the code red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't say sir like I just asked you 
                         if you cleaned the latrine. You heard 
                         what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order 
                         you guys to give Santiago a code 
                         red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to Downey)
                         Did he?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You mind telling me why the hell you 
                         never mentioned this before?

                                     DAWSON
                         You didn't ask us, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a 
                         place in my heart, corporal, I get 
                         paid no matter how much time you 
                         spend in jail.

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir. I know you do, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fuck you, Harold.

               There's some understandable tension in the room, broken by --

                                     JO
                         Alright. Let's sort this out. There 
                         was a platoon meeting on August 6th 
                         at four in the afternoon. And Lt. 
                         Kendrick, he gave strict instructions 
                         that nothing was to happen to 
                         Santiago. Now is that true? I want 
                         you to speak freely.

                                     DAWSON
                         Ma'am, that's correct. But then he 
                         dismissed the platoon and we all 
                         went to our rooms.

                                     JO
                         And what happened then?

                                     DAWSON
                         Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When?

                                     DAWSON
                         About five minutes after the meeting 
                         broke, sir. About 16:20.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         And what happened then?

                                     DAWSON
                         Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give 
                         Santiago a Code Red.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

               ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some 
               other OFFICERS.

               A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO 
               walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross.

               KAFFEE shouts --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack!

               But ROSS is into the game...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Jack!!

                                     ROSS
                              (waving him off)
                         Hang on...

                                     KAFFEE
                         They were given an order.

               ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by 
               him. He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the 
               gym and the three of them make their way to privacy.

                                     JO
                         How long have you known about the

                         commander?

                         Jack didn't know about the order. 
                         Because if he did and he hadn't told 
                         us, Jack knows he'd be violating 
                         about 14 articles of the code of 
                         ethics. As it is, he's got enough to 
                         worry about. God forbid our clients 
                         decide to plead not guilty and testify 
                         for the record that they were given

                         Dawson and Downey's room and

               INT. A HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kaffee and JO are sitting at a table. Dawson and Downey are 
               at parade rest. Kaffee lights a cigarette.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Here's the story: The Goverment's 
                         offering Assault and Conduct

                         home in six months.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY say nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         "Wow, Kaffee, you're the greatest 
                         lawyer in the world. How can we ever 
                         thank you?" Fellas, you hear what I 
                         just said, you're going home in six 
                         months.

                         I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do what?

                                     DAWSON
                         Make a deal, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     DAWSON
                         We did nothing wrong, sir. We did 
                         our job. If that has consequences, 
                         then I accept them. But'I won't say 
                         I'm guilty, sir.

               KAFFEE can't believe this. He looks over at JO.

                         Did you --
                              (to DAWSON and DOWNEY)
                         Did she put you up to this?

                                     JO
                         No.

                         We have a code, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Well zippity-doo-dah. You and your 
                         code plead not guilty and you'll be 
                         in jail for the rest of your life. 
                         Do what I'm telling you and you'll 
                         be home in six months.

               DAWSON just stares at him.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Do it, Harold. Six months. It's 
                         nothing. It's a hockey season.

                                     DAWSON
                         Permission to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Speak!

                                     DAWSON
                         What do we do then, sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         When?

                                     DAWSON
                         After six months. We'd be dishonorably 
                         discharged, right sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes.

                                     DAWSON
                         What do we do then, sir? We joined 
                         the corps 'cause we wanted to live 
                         our lives by a certain code. And we 
                         found it in the corps. And now you're 
                         asking us to sign a piece of paper 
                         that says we have no honor. You're 
                         asking us to say we're not marines. 
                         If a judge and jury decide that what 
                         we did was wrong, I'll accept whatever 
                         punishment they give. But I believe 
                         I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my 
                         job. And I won't dishonor myself, my 
                         unit, or the Corps, so that I can qo 
                         home in six months.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               HOLD ON the four of them for a moment, then

                         Commander, I want to talk to corporal 
                         Dawson alone for a minute.

               Jo waits Just a moment before she calls out --

                                     JO
                              (to Downey)
                         Let's go in another room. Louden, 
                         everything's gonna be alright.

               The M.P. has shown up and unlocked the cell door.

                                     JO
                              (continuing; to M.P.)
                         We're gonna go into a holding room.

                                     M.P.
                         Aye, aye, ma'am.

               JO, DOWNEY, and the M.P. are gone. KAFFEE paces a moment 
               before he says --

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't like me that much, do you?
                              (beat)
                         Forget it, don't answer that, it 
                         doesn't matter.

               KAFFEE paces another moment, then sits on the cot. He's trying 
               to choose his tack carefully.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You know, Downey worships you. He's 
                         gonna do whatever you do. Are you 
                         really gonna let this happen to him 
                         because of a code? Harold?

                                     DAWSON
                         Do you think we were right?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It doesn't matter what I --

                                     DAWSON
                         Do you think we were right?

               KAFFEE gets up.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         I think you'd lose.

                                     DAWSON
                              (beat)
                         You're such a coward, I can't believe 
                         they let you wear a uniform.

               KAFFEE stares at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not gonna feel responsible for 
                         this, Harold. I did everything I 
                         could. You're going to Levenworth 
                         for the better part of your life, 
                         and you know what? I don't give a 
                         shit.

               KAFFEE calls out --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         M.P.!

               KAFFEE and DAWSON are staring each other down. The M.P. shows 
               up and unlocks the cell door. KAFFEE steps out to leave.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         What happened to saluting an officer 
                         when he leaves the room?

               DAWSON holds on KAFFEE. Then DAWSON, a man who would rather 
               die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts 
               them in his pockets.

               The cell door closes and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OFFICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               One light is on at the end of the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM has joined KAFFEE and JO. The mood is somber.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dawson's gonna go to jail just to 
                         spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump 
                         off a cliff, that's his business. 
                         I'm not gonna hold his hand on the 
                         way down.
                              (to SAM)
                         I want to get him a new lawyer. How 
                         do I do it?

                                     SAM
                         You just make a motion tomorrow 
                         morning at the arraignment. The 
                         judge'll ask you if you want to enter 
                         a plea. You tell him you want new 
                         counsel assigned.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Then that's that.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         Yeah. One thing, though. When you 
                         ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, 
                         be sure and ask nicely.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you want from me?

                                     JO
                         I want you to let 'em be judged! I 
                         want you to stand up and make an 
                         argument!

                                     SAM
                         An argument that didn't work for 
                         Calley at My Lai, an argument that 
                         didn't work for the Nazis at 
                         Nuremberg.

                                     KAFFEE
                         For Christ sake, Sam, do you really 
                         think that's the same as two teenage 
                         marines executing a routine order 
                         that they never believed would result 
                         in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis.

               There's a pause in the room.

                                     JO
                         Don't look now, Danny, but you're 
                         making an argument.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Yeah.
                              (beat)
                         Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new 
                         attorney.

                                     JO
                         Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? 
                         Were daddy's expectations really 
                         that high?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Please, spare me the psycho-babble 
                         father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll 
                         have their day in court, but they'll 
                         have it with another lawyer.

                                     JO
                         Another lawyer won't be good enough. 
                         They need you. You know how to win.
                              (beat)
                         You know they have a case. And you 
                         know how to win. You walk away from 
                         this now, and you have sealed their 
                         fate.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Their fate was sealed the moment 
                         Santiago died.

                                     JO
                         Do you believe they have a defense?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You and Dawson both live in the same 
                         dreamland. It doesn't matter what I 
                         believe, it only matters what I can 
                         prove. So please don't tell me what 
                         I know and don't know. I know the 
                         law.

               JO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away.  
               She turns back.

                                     JO
                         You know nothing about the law. You're 
                         a used car salesman, Daniel. You're 
                         an ambulance chaser with a rank. 
                         You're nothing.
                              (beat)
                         Live with that.

               Jo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone. We HOLD on KAFFEE. He's 
               not having a good night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT

               KAFFEE sits at the bar. The place is crowded with YUPPIES 
               and STUDENTS. KAFFEE's been drinking there a while now. Next 
               to him is a YUPPIE LAWYER, regaling his FRIENDS with the 
               story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high 
               stakes corporate law.

               We HOLD on a KAFFEE a moment longer, then

                                     YUPPIE LAWYER
                         ...So I told duncan if we leverage 
                         the acquisition of Biotech, the 
                         interrogatories would be there on 
                         demand. All I have to do is not pick 
                         up the phone and it'll run Flaherty 
                         ten thousand a day in court costs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A GEORGETOWN STREET - NIGHT

               KAFFEE sits on a bench in the night. He takes a sip from a 
               bottle he's holding in a brown paper bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARADE GROUNDS - DAY

               A bright, sunny morning. The BAND is performing for a group 
               of day campers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               DAWSON and DOWNEY are at the defense table, ROSS is his place. 
               KAFFEE walks in and joins JO and SAM at their table. Papers 
               are being passed back and forth between ROSS and the SERGEANT 
               AT AMS. Quiet activity.

               The door in the back of the courtroom opens and RANDOLPH, a 
               marine colonel, enters and takes his place at the bench. We 
               can HEAR the band in the background.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All rise.

               Everyone present in the courtroom stands.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Where are we?

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Docket number 411275. VR-5. United 
                         States versus Lance Corporal Harold 
                         W. Dawson and Private First Class 
                         Loudon Downey. Defendants are charged 
                         with Conspiracy to Commit Murder, 
                         Murder in the First Degree, and 
                         Conduct Unbecoming a United States 
                         Marine.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Does defense wish to enter a plea?

               KAFFEE stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         They're not guilty.

               JO, SAM, ROSS, RANDOLPH... it's hard to say who's the most 
               surprised. It takes everything Jo's got to suppress a smile. 
               The silence is broken by ROSS, who takes the two files, drops 
               them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.

               RANDOLPH looks at KAFFEE and ROSS, then turns to the SERGEANT 
               AT ARMS.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Enter a plea of not guilty for the 
                         defendants. We'll adjourn until ten- 
                         hundred, three weeks from today, at 
                         which time this Court will reconvene 
                         as a General Court-Martial.

               He raps the gavel.

               RANDOLPH walks out. ROSS walks up the aisle without a word 
               to anyone. The M.P.'s come to escort DAWSON and DOWNEY back 
               to their cell.

               KAFFEE and JO and SAM are the only ones remaining. SAM is 
               looking at KAFFEE with question marks in his eyes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why does a junior grade with six 
                         months experience and a track record 
                         for plea bargaining get assigned a 
                         murder case?
                              (beat)
                         Would it be so that it never sees 
                         the inside of a courtroom?

               KAFFEE picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the 
               door.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         We'll work out of my apartment.  
                         Every night, seven o'clock. Jo, before 
                         you come over tonight, pick up a 
                         carton of legal pads, a half-dozen 
                         boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes 
                         of black pens. Sam get a couple of 
                         desk lamps. I need you to start on a 
                         preliminary medical profile and Jo, 
                         we need all the fitness reports on 
                         Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The 
                         only thing I have to eat is Yoo-Hoo 
                         and SugarSnacks, so if you want 
                         anything else, bring it with you. 
                         Okay?

               Jo's still stunned.

                                     JO
                         Yeah.

               KAFFEE's at the door, stops, turns around, and takes it all 
               in for a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                         So this is what a courtroom looks 
                         like.

               He walks out the door, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Among the stuff, is a blackboard that's been hung on the 
               wall. Written across the top are three headings:

                    INTENT             CODE RED             THE ORDER

               Sam is on the floor, sorting papers into piles. KAFFEE comes 
               in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of Yoo-Hoo and joins 
               Sam on the floor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you able to speak to your friend 
                         at NIS?

                                     SAM
                         She said if Markinson doesn't want 
                         to be found, we're not gonna find 
                         him. She said I could be Markinson 
                         and you wouldn't know it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Are you Markinson?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Well, I'm not Markinson, that's two 
                         down.

               SAM doesn't laugh.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         What.

                                     SAM
                              (pause)
                         I was wondering, now that Joanne's 
                         working on this... I was wondering 
                         if you still need me.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         They were following an order, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         An illegal order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think Dawson and Downey know it 
                         was an illegal order?

                                     SAM
                         It doesn't matter if they know, any 
                         decent human being would've refused 
                         to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         They're not permitted to question 
                         orders.

                                     SAM
                         Then what's the secret? What are the 
                         magic words? I give orders every 
                         day, and nobody follows them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have softball games and marching 
                         bands. They work at a place where 
                         you have to wear camouflage or you 
                         might get shot.

               Sam looks away. He doesn't buy it.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; pause)
                         I need you. You're better at research 
                         than I am and you know how to prepare 
                         a witness.

               Jo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers 
               under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other.  
               But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer.

                                     JO
                         I've got medical reports and Chinese 
                         food. I say we eat first.

               KAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head.

                                     SAM
                         Did you get any dumplings?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT

               The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and 
               JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks, 
               he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers 
               to the blackboard.

                                     KAFFEE
                         This is our defense. Intent: No one 
                         can prove there was poison on the 
                         raq. Code Red: They're common and 
                         accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order:
                              (he writes)
                         A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no 
                         choice but to follow it.
                              (beat)
                         That's it.

                                     SAM
                         What about motive?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We're a little weak on motive. They 
                         had one.

                                     JO
                         Just because a person has a motive 
                         doesn't mean --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline 
                         shooting when it comes up. For now 
                         we start here --
                              (pointing to INTENT)
                         I don't know what made Santiago die, 
                         I don't want to know. I just want to 
                         be able to show it could've been 
                         something other than poison. Jo, 
                         talk to doctors. Find out everything 
                         there is to know about lactic 
                         acidosis. Let's start prepping for 
                         Stone.

                         As long as we're on the subject of 
                         the doctor --

                         Here we go.

                                     JO
                         Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't 
                         know what killed Santiago, then he 
                         meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock 
                         he says it was poison? The doctor's 
                         covering up the truth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I 
                         wouldn't be able to use the "Liar, 
                         Liar, Pants on Fire" defense. We 
                         can't prove coercion!! Alright,

               KAFFEE looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of 
               paper.

               The scenes cover the three weeks of preparation leading up 
               to the trial, and are interspersed with shots of Kaffee's 
               apartment getting messier, KAFFEE, JO and SAM flipping through 
               documents and reference books, writing on the blackboard,

               Jo's on the phone, KAFFEE and SAM are going over testimony, 
               with SAM sitting in a mock witness chair. During this, KAFFEE 
               will go to the door, pay the PIZZA Man for the pizza, and 
               return without missing a single beat.

                         shift in your seat, don't scribble 
                         furiously. Whatever happens, you 
                         have to look like it's exactly what 
                         you knew was gonna happen. When you 
                         pass me documents --

                                     JO/SAM
                         Do it swiftly, but don't look 
                         overanxious.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         And don't wear that perfume in Court, 
                         it wrecks my concentration.

                                     JO
                         Really!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I was talking to Sam.

                                     SAM
                         What time is it?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Time to go home. Try to get some 
                         sleep tonight.

                                     JO
                              (to SAM)
                         I'll give you a ride.

               SAM begins to gather up his things. He stands in front of 
               KAFFEE.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

                                     SAM
                         See you in court.

               Sam steps out the door. JO looks at the ground, then up at 
               KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                         Danny --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know what you're gonna say. You 
                         don't have to. We've had our 
                         differences. I've said some things I 
                         didn't mean, you've said some things 
                         you didn't means but you're happy 
                         that I stuck with the case. And if 
                         you've gained a certain respect for 
                         me over the last three weeks that 
                         you didn't have before, well, of 
                         course I'm happy about that, but we 
                         don't have to make a whole big deal 
                         out of it. You like me. I won't make 
                         you say it.

                                     JO
                         I was just gonna tell you to wear 
                         matching socks tomorrow.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Oh.
                              (beat)
                         Okay. Good tip.

                                     JO
                         We're ready.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Bet your ass.

               Jo walks out the door and KAFFEE closes it and locks it behind 
               her.

               Then he says, very softly...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         We're gonna get creamed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

               A few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around 
               the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately 
               stricken by something:

               In his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a 
               real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and 
               walks into

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               A few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine 
               enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, 
               Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. 
               The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few 
               people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is 
               stopped by a voice behind him.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Lieutenant Kaffee?

               KAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly 
               Dawson's parents.

                                     MAN
                         You're gonna save our son, aren't 
                         you?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         I'll do my best.

               KAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with 
               a WOMAN in her mid-30's.

                                     JO
                         Danny, I want you to meet Ginny 
                         Miller, Louden's aunt.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're Aunt Ginny?

                                     GINNY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sorry, I was expecting someone  
                         older.

                                     GINNY
                         So was I.

               Not quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear 
               before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

               He walks over to ROSS.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Last chance. I'll flip you for it.

               RANDOLPH enters.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All rise.

                                     ROSS
                         Too late.

               KAFFEE walks back to his table as

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All those having business with this 
                         general court-martial, stand forward 
                         and you shall be heard. Captain Julius 
                         Alexander Randolph is presiding. God 
                         save the United States of America.

               RANDOLPH raps the gavel.

               RANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two 
               defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the 
               court record.

                                     ROSS
                         No objection, your honor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No objection.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Is the Government prepared to make 
                         an opening statement?

                                     ROSS
                              (standing)
                         Yes sir.

               ROSS walks to the jury box.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         The facts of the case are this: At 
                         midnight on August 6th, the defendants 
                         went into the barracks room of their 
                         platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
                         They woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. A few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
                         drowned in his own blood and was 
                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
                         midnight. These are the facts of the 
                         case. And they are undisputed. That's 
                         right. The story I just told you is 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, 
                         the Government will also demonstrate 
                         that the defendants soaked the rag 
                         with poison, and entered Santiago's 
                         room with motive and intent to kill.
                              (beat)
                         Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to 
                         pull off a little magic act, he's 
                         gonna try a little misdirection. 
                         He's going to astonish you with 
                         stories of rituals and dazzle you 
                         with official sounding terms like 
                         Code Red. He might even cut into a 
                         few officers for you. He'll have no 
                         evidence, mind you, none. But it's 
                         gonna be entertaining. When we get 
                         to the end, all the magic in the 
                         world will not have been able to 
                         divert your attention from the fact 
                         that Willy Santiago is dead, and 
                         Dawson and Downey killed him. These 
                         are the facts of the case.
                              (beat)
                         And they are undisputed.

               ROSS walks back to his seat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee?

               Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of 
               his mouth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There was no poison on the rag and 
                         there was no intent to kill and any 
                         attempt to prove otherwise is futile 
                         because it just ain't true.
                              (beat)
                         When Dawson and Downey went into 
                         Santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
                         because of vengeance or hatred, it 
                         wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
                         because they were looking for kicks 
                         on a Friday night. It's because it 
                         was what they were ordered to do.
                              (beat)
                         Let me say that again: It's because 
                         it was what they were ordered to do. 
                         Now, out in the real world, that 
                         means nothing. And here at the 
                         Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't 
                         mean a whole lot more. But if you're 
                         a marine assigned to Rifle Security 
                         Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
                         Cuba, and you're given an order, you 
                         follow it or you pack your bags.
                              (beat)
                         Make no mistake about it, Harold 
                         Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting 
                         before you in judgement today because 
                         they did their job.

               KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Is the Government ready to call its 
                         first witness?

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, the Government 
                         calls Mr. R.C McGuire.

               While McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn 
               in, KAFFEE has sat back down.

               He leans over to DAWSON and whispers.

                                     KAFFEE
                         How you doin'?

               DAWSON doesn't change his expression.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Good.

                                     ROSS
                         Mr. McGuire, would you state your 
                         full name and occupation for the 
                         record, please?

                                     MCGUIRE

                         Mr. McGuire, did your office receive 
                         a letter from PFC William Santiago 
                         on 3 August of this year?

                         We did.

                         What did the letter say?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         That a member of Private Santiago's 
                         unit had illegally fired his weapon 
                         over the fenceline.

                         Was that marine identified in the 
                         letter?

                         No sir. I notified the barracks C.O., 
                         Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming 
                         down to investigate.

                                     MCGUIRE
                         For the shift reported, only one 
                         sentry returned his weapon to the 
                         switch with a round of ammunition 
                         missing.

                         Mr. McGuire, have you questioned 
                         Corporal Dawson about the fenceline 
                         shooting?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         Yes. He claims to have been engaged 
                         in some manner by the enemy.

                         Corporal Dawson's been charged with 
                         a number of crimes, why wasn't he 
                         charged with firing at the enemy 
                         without cause?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         There wasn't enough evidence to 
                         support such a charge.

                         Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what 
                         you mean when you say there wasn't 
                         enough evidence to support such a 
                         charge. You had Willy Santiago's 
                         letter.

                         Santiago was the only witness, but I 
                         never had a chance to interview him. 
                         So I don't know what he saw.

                         informer in our group.  That Private

                         examination, so I'm sure you won't 
                         mind if his opinion is admitted now.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn.

               KAFFEE sits.

                         Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die 
                         of poisoning?

                                     STONE
                         Absolutely.

                                     ROSS
                         Are you aware that the lab report 
                         and the coroners report showed no 
                         traces of poison?

                                     STONE
                         Yes I am.

                                     ROSS
                         Then how do you justify --

                                     STONE
                         There are literally dozens of toxins 
                         which are virtually undetectable, 
                         both in the human body and on a 
                         fabric. The nature of the acidosis 
                         is the compelling factor in this 
                         issue.

                         Thank you, sir.

               KAFFEE gets up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, you testified that it 
                         takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes 
                         before it becomes lethal.

                                     STONE
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let me ask you, is it possible for a 
                         person to have an affliction, some 
                         sort of condition, which might, in 
                         the case of this person, actually 
                         speed up the process of acidosis 
                         dramatically?

               STONE says nothing for a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Commander, is it possible?

                                     STONE
                         Certainly.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What might some of those conditions 
                         be?

                                     STONE
                              (beat)
                         If a person had a coronary disorder... 
                         or a cerebral disorder, the process 
                         would be more rapid.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, if I had a coronary 
                         condition, and a perfectly clean rag 
                         was placed in my mouth, and the rag 
                         was accidentally pushed too far down, 
                         is it possible that my cells would 
                         continue burning sugar after the rag 
                         was taken out?

                                     STONE
                         It would have to be a very serious 
                         condition.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Is it possible to have a serious 
                         coronary condition, where the initial 
                         warning signals were so mild as to 
                         escape a physician during a routine 
                         medical exam?

                                     STONE
                         Possibly. There would still be 
                         symptoms though.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What kind of symptoms?

                                     STONE
                         There are hundreds of symptoms of a --

                         Chest pains?

                                     STONE
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Shortness of breath?

                                     STONE
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fatigue?

                                     STONE
                         Of course.

               KAFFEE has gone back to his table where JO has handed him 
               some documents. He shows then to STONE.

                         Doctor, is this your signature?

                                     STONE
                         Yes it is.

                                     KAFFEE
                         This in an order for Private Santiago 
                         to be put on restricted duty. Would 
                         you read your hand written remarks 
                         at the bottom of the page, please,

                         Commander, isn't it possible that 
                         Santiago had a serious coronary 
                         condition, and it was that condition, 
                         and not some mysterious poison, that 
                         caused the accelerated chemical 
                         reaction?

                                     STONE
                         No. I personally give the men a 
                         physical examination every three 
                         months. And every three months Private 
                         Santiago got a clean bill of health.

                         And that's why it had to be, poison, 
                         right, Commander? 'Cause Lord knows, 
                         if you put a man with a serious 
                         coronary condition back on duty with 
                         a clean bill of health, and that man 
                         died from a heart related incident,

                         practice medicine for 21 years, you 
                         are Board Certified in Internal 
                         Medicine, you are the Chief of

                         serves over 8000 men. In your 
                         professional opinion, was Willy 
                         Santiago poisoned?

                         to Commander Stone's testimony, and 
                         ask that it be stricken from the

                         Court instruct the jury to lend no 
                         weight to this witness's testimony.

               KAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their 
               poker-faces. RANDOLPH'S gonna try to be polite about this, 
               but he thought he made himself clear.

                         if the need arises, the Government 
                         rests.

                         hundred hours this Monday, the l9th

               And the courtroom begins clearing out. KAFFEE, JO and SAM

                                     SAM
                         I strenuously object? Is that how it 
                         works? Objection. Overruled. No, no, 
                         no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, 
                         well if you strenuously object, let 
                         me take a moment to reconsider.

                                     JO
                         I got it on the record.

                                     SAM
                         You also got it in the jury's head 
                         that we're afraid of the doctor. You 
                         object once so they can hear you say 
                         he's not a criminologist. You keep 
                         after it and it looks like this great 
                         cross we did was just a bunch of 
                         fancy lawyer tricks. It's the 
                         difference between paper law and 
                         trial --

                         Christ, you even had the Judge saying 
                         Stone was an expert!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, she made a mistake. Let's not 
                         relive it.

               There's an uncomfortable silence.

                                     SAM
                         I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll meet 
                         you tonight.

               Sam starts to leave. JO turns and says

                                     JO
                         Why do you hate them so much?

               Sam stops and turns around.

                                     SAM
                         They beat up on a weakling, and that's 
                         all they did. The rest is just 
                         smokefilled coffee-house crap. They 
                         tortured and tormented a weaker kid. 
                         They didn't like him. And they killed 
                         him. And why? Because he couldn't 
                         run very fast.

               A long silence. KAFFEE makes a decision.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright. Everybody take the night 
                         off.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         I apologize, I, --

                                     KAFFEE
                         It's alright. We've been working 20 
                         hour days for three and a half weeks 
                         straight. Take the night off. Go see 
                         your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do 
                         whatever it is you do when you're 
                         not here. What day is tomorrow?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll start at ten.

               KAFFEE picks up his stuff and walks out.

               SAM and JO stand there uncomfortably for a moment. JO begins 
               packing up her things.

                                     SAM
                         Why do you like them so much?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         'Cause they stand on a wall.
                              (beat)
                         And they say "Nothing's gonna hurt 
                         you tonight. Not on my watch."

               Despite their differences, SAM likes this woman.

                                     SAM
                         Don't worry about the doctor. This 
                         trial starts Monday.

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A baseball game is on.

               KAFFEE's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. 
               He's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room.

               He's studying it. Studying it hard. There's a knock on the 
               door. KAFFEE answers it. JO is standing in the doorway.

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry to bother you, I should've 
                         called first.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No, I was just watching a baseball 
                         game.

                                     JO
                         I was wondering if -- how you'd feel 
                         about my taking you to dinner tonight.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, are you asking me out on a date?

                                     JO
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It sounded like you were asking me 
                         out on a date.

                                     JO
                         I wasn't.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've been asked out on dates before, 
                         and that's what it sounded like.

                                     JO
                         Do you like seafood? I know a good 
                         seafood place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               On the Virginia side of the Potomac. KAFFEE and JO are sitting 
               at a table, finishing up dinner.

                                     JO
                         My third case was a Drunk and 
                         Disorderly. The trial lasted nine 
                         weeks. I rounded up 31 people who 
                         were in the bar that night.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nine weeks on a D and D? What was 
                         the prosecutor offering?

                                     JO
                         15 days.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Well, you sure hustled the shit outta 
                         him.

                                     JO
                         After that, they moved me to internal 
                         affairs.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Tough to blame them.

                                     JO
                         Where I've earned two distinguished 
                         service medals and two letters of 
                         commendation.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why are you always giving me your 
                         resume?

                                     JO
                         Because I want you to think I'm good 
                         lawyer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I do.

                                     JO
                         No you don't.
                              (beat)
                         I think you're an exceptional lawyer. 
                         I watch the jurors, they respond to 
                         you, they like you. I see you 
                         convincing them. I think Dawson and 
                         Downey are gonna end up owing their 
                         lives to you.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Jo... I think you have to prepare 
                         yourself for the fact that we're 
                         gonna lose.
                              (beat)
                         Ross's opening speech, it was all 
                         true.
                              (beat)
                         I mean, let's pretend for a minute 
                         that it would actually matter to 
                         this jury that the guys were given 
                         an order. We can't prove it ever 
                         happened.
                              (beat)
                         We'll keep doing what we're doing, 
                         and we'll put on a show, but at the 
                         end of the day, all we have is the 
                         testimony of two people accused of 
                         murder.

                                     JO
                         We'll find Markinson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna 
                         lose huge.

               We HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear

                         Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine 
                         Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
                         Cuba.

               CORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around 
               Cuba, is on the stand.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Corporal Howard, name some reasons 
                         why a marine would get a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Being late for platoon or company 
                         meetings, keeping his barracks in 
                         disorder, falling back on a run...

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have you ever received a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir. We were doing seven man 
                         assault drills, and my weapon slipped. 
                         It's just cause it was over a hundred 
                         degrees and my palms were sweaty and 
                         I'd forgot to use the resin like we 
                         were taught.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And what happened?

                                     HOWARD
                         That night the guys in my squad threw 
                         a blanket over me and took turns 
                         punching me in the arm for five 
                         minutes. Then they poured glue on my 
                         hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I 
                         ain't never dropped my weapon since.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was Private Santiago ever late for 
                         platoon meetings?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                         Was his barracks ever in disorder?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                         Did he ever fall back on a run?

                                     HOWARD
                         All the time, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did he ever, prior to the night of 
                         August 6th, receive a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         No sir.

                         No, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got a code red 'cause your palms 
                         were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, 
                         this burden to his unit, ever get 
                         one?

                                     HOWARD
                         Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dawson wouldn't allow it.

                                     HOWARD
                         The guys talked tough about Santiago, 
                         but they wouldn't go near him. They 
                         were too afraid of Dawson, sir.

                                     ROSS

                         I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever 
                         want to give Santiago a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                         Why didn't you?

                         'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir.

                         Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask 
                         you some questions now.

               ROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on 
               the table. He brings one to HOWARD.

                         Handbook for New Recruits. Are you

                                     HOWARD

                                     ROSS
                         Have you read it?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Good.
                              (hands him the book)
                         Would you turn to the chapter that 
                         deals with code reds, please.

                                     HOWARD
                         Sir?

                                     ROSS
                         Just flip to the page in that book 
                         that discusses code reds.

                                     HOWARD
                         Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we 
                         use -- it's just used down at GITMO, 
                         sir. I don't know if it actually --

               ROSS has produced another book.

                                     ROSS
                         We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps 
                         Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE 
                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll 
                         find the term code red and its 
                         definition in this book, am I correct?

                                     HOWARD
                         No sir.

                                     ROSS
                         No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. 
                         Is their no book, no manual or 
                         pamphlet, no set of orders or 
                         regulations that let me know that, 
                         as a marine, one of my duties is to 
                         perform code reds?

                                     HOWARD
                              (pause)
                         No sir. No books, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         No further questions.

               ROSS sits. KAFFEE walks over to ROSS's table and picks up 
               one of the books. He brings it to HOWARD.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Corporal, would you turn to the page 
                         in this book that says where the 
                         enlisted men's mess hall is?

                                     HOWARD
                         Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't understand, how did you know 
                         where the enlisted men's mess hall 
                         was if it's not in this book?

                                     HOWARD
                         I guess I just followed the crowd at 
                         chow time, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No more questions.

               KAFFEE chucks the book back on ROSS's desk.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Corporal Howard, you can step down.

                                     HOWARD
                              (greatly relieved)
                         Thank you, sir.

               KAFFEE gives HOWARD a subtle "You Did Good, Kid" look, and 
               we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DUSK

               It's the end of the day's session. KAFFEE walks down the 
               hall with SAM and JO.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Seven tonight, we'll do a final 
                         Kendrick review. I want to slam- 
                         dunk this guy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK STAND - NIGHT

               KAFFEE'S CAR

               as it drives along a street in the D.C. business district. 
               it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting 
               against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He 
               hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and 
               runs to the stand.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hey, Luther.

                                     LUTHER
                         Admiral, how's the big case goin'?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nose to the grindstone.

                                     LUTHER
                         No flies on you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A rolling stone gathers no moss.

                                     LUTHER
                         Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat 
                         lady sings.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Ain't that the truth. Catch you 
                         tomorrow.

               He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger 
               seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does

               -- a hand is slapped over his mouth --

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's Matthew Markinson.

               -- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin.

               Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is 
               MARKINSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jesus fucking Christ!!--

                                     MARKINSON
                         You left the door unlocked.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Scared the shit outta me.

                                     MARKINSON
                         Drive.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Are you aware you're under subpoena?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes. I'm also aware that the lives 
                         of two marines are in your hands. If 
                         there was something I could do about 
                         that, I would, but since I can't, 
                         all I can do is help you. Why don't 
                         you drive, Lieutenant.

               KAFFEE begins driving down the street.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you know?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know everything.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was it a code red?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did Kendrick give the order?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you witness it?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I didn't need to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you witness it?!

                                     MARKINSON
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then how do you know?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You know shit.

                                     MARKINSON
                         He was never gonna be transferred 
                         off the base.

               And with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of 
               the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He 
               turns to Markinson.

                                     MARKINSON
                              (continuing)
                         Jessep was going to keep him on the 
                         base. He said he wanted him trained.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We've got the transfer order. It's 
                         got your signature.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know. I signed it the morning you 
                         arrived in Cuba. Six days after 
                         Santiago died.

               KAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind 
                         of immunity with the prosecutor. In 
                         about four days, you're gonna appear 
                         as a witness for the defense, and 
                         you're gonna tell the court exactly 
                         what you told me. Right now I'm gonna 
                         check you into a motel, and we're 
                         gonna start from the beginning.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I don't want a deal. And I don't 
                         want immunity.

               KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs.

                                     MARKINSON
                              (continuing)
                         I want you to know, I'm proud neither 
                         of what I've done nor what I'm doing.

               KAFFEE puts the car in gear and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Where KAFFEE has just finished telling his story to an amazed 
               SAM and JO.

               There's silence.

               Then JO has a total adrenaline rush.

                                     JO
                         Where is he?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Route 23 Best Western.

               JO picks up the phone.

                                     JO
                         I want him guarded.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's probably a good idea.

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. 
                         My clearance code is 411273.

               KAFFEE is impressed. He turns to SAM --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Clearance code?

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         I don't have a clearance code. Do 
                         you have a --

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a 
                         witness.

               Jo continues giving information to the person on the phone, 
               while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. Sam is writing 
               down notes as fast as he can.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He also said that Jessep's lying 
                         about the transportation off the 
                         base. Jessep said six the next morning 
                         was the first flight Santiago could've 
                         left on, Markinson says there was a 
                         plane that left seven hours earlier.

               JO hangs up the phone.

                                     JO
                         Damn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That was impressive. Did you hear 
                         what I just said about the flight?

                                     JO
                         Yes.

                         Sam, when a plane takes off from a 
                         base, there's gotta be some kind of 
                         record kept, right?

                                     SAM
                         We need the Tower Chief's Log for 
                         GITMO.

                         Get it.

                         We're gonna win.

                         Jo, don't get crazy about this. We 
                         don't know who Markinson is. We don't 
                         know what the log book's gonna say. 
                         You just concentrate on Downey. I'm 
                         gonna talk to Ross and tell him where 
                         we are.

               INT. A WASHINGTON SALOON - NIGHT

               A WAITRESS sets two drinks down in front of KAFFEE and ROSS, 
               who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the 
               back.

                                     ROSS
                         That was nice work today. The redirect 
                         on Howard.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have Markinson.

               ROSS only takes a moment digest this.

                                     ROSS
                         Where is he?

                         A motel room in Arlington with 14 
                         Federal Marshals outside his door.  
                         Take a sip of your drink.

                                     ROSS
                         Damn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The transfer order that Parkinson 
                         signed is phoney. And Jessep's 
                         statement that the six a.m. flight 
                         was the first available is a lie, 
                         we're checking the tower chief's 
                         log. But in the meantime I'm gonna 
                         put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the 
                         stand and see if we can't have a 
                         little fun.

               ROSS takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the 
               line for Kaffee..

                                     ROSS
                         I have an obligation to tell you 
                         that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep 
                         of any crime without proper evidence, 
                         you'll be subject to Court-Martial 
                         for professional misconduct. And 
                         that's something that'll be stapled 
                         to every job application you ever 
                         fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold 
                         up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying 
                         this to intimidate you. I'm being 
                         your lawyer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you 
                         that I think the whole fuckin' bunch 
                         of you are certifiably insane. And 
                         this code of honor of yours makes me 
                         wanna beat the shit outta something.

                         Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep 
                         and Markinson and Kendrick because 
                         we wear the same uniform. I'm your 
                         friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, 
                         I don't think your clients belong in 
                         jail. But I don't get to make that 
                         decision. I represent the Government 
                         of the United States. Without passion 
                         or prejudice. And my client has a 
                         case.
                              (pause)
                         I want you to acknowledge that the 
                         judge advocate has made you aware of 
                         the possible consequences involved 
                         in accusing a marine officer of a 
                         felony without proper evidence.

                         I've been so advised.

               ROSS stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table.

                         You got bullied into that courtroom, 
                         Danny. By everyone. By Dawson, by 
                         Galloway, shit, I practically dared 
                         you. Not for a second have you 
                         believed you could win. You got 
                         bullied into that room by the memory 
                         of a dead lawyer.

               INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

               People are filing in. KENDRICK is standing at the entrance 
               to the courtroom. KAFFEE glides past him...

                                     KAFFEE
                         Batter up, J.J.

               KENDRICK watches this impudent thing walk into the courtroom 
               as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               KENDRICK's on the stand. What drives Kaffee's entire 
               examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him. He's gonna 
               win. At least this round. All he has to do is not let his 
               emotions take control of his professional skill.

               SAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he 
               needs them.

                         Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was 
                         Private Santiago a good marine?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'd say he was about average.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, you signed three fitness 
                         reports on Santiago. On all three 
                         reports you indicated a rating of 
                         Below Average.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes. Private Santiago was Below 
                         Average I didn't see the need in 
                         trampling on a man's grave.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We appreciate that, but you're under 
                         oath now, and I think unpleasant as 
                         it may be, we'd all just as soon 
                         hear the truth.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm aware of my oath.

               KAFFEE's handed some more files.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, these are the last three 
                         fitness reports you signed for Lance 
                         Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey 
                         received three straight marks of 
                         Exceptional. Dawson received two 
                         marks of Exceptional, but on this 
                         most recent report, dated June 9th 
                         of this year, he received a rating 
                         of Below Average. It's this last 
                         report that I'd like to discuss for 
                         a moment.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That's fine.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after 
                         Infantry Training School was perfect. 
                         Records indicate that over half that 
                         class has since been promoted to 
                         full corporal, while Dawson has 
                         remained a lance corporal. Was 
                         Dawson's promotion held up because 
                         of this last fitness report.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm sure it was.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you recall why Dawson was given 
                         such a poor grade on this report?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm sure I don't. I have many men in 
                         my charge, Lieutenant, I write many 
                         fitness reports.

                         Do you recall an incident involving 
                         a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found 
                         stealing liquor from the Officer's 
                         Club?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you report private Barnes to the 
                         proper authorities?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I have two books at my bedside, 
                         Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct 
                         and the King James Bible. The only 
                         proper authorities I'm aware of are 
                         my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan 
                         R. Jessep and the Lord our God.

                         Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can 
                         have the record reflect your lack of 
                         acknowledgment of this court as a 
                         proper authority.

                         Did you report Private Barnes to

                                     KENDRICK
                         I remember thinking very highly of 
                         Private Barnes, and not wanting to 
                         see his record tarnished by a formal 
                         charge.

                         You preferred it to be handled within 
                         the unit.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I most certainly did.

                         two other men to make sure that 
                         Private Barnes receive no food or 
                         drink except water for a period of 
                         seven days?

                                     KENDRICK
                         That's a distortion of the truth. 
                         Private Barnes was placed on barracks 
                         restriction. He was given water and 
                         vitamin supplements, and I assure 
                         you that at no time was his health 
                         in danger.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sure it was lovely for Private 
                         Barnes, but you did order the barracks 
                         restriction, didn't you? And you did 
                         order the denial of food.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Wouldn't this form of discipline be 
                         considered a code red?

                                     KENDRICK
                              (beat)
                         Not necessarily.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If I called the other 8000 men at 
                         Guantanamo Bay to testify, would 
                         they consider it a Code Red?

                                     ROSS
                         Please the court, the witness can't 
                         possibly testify as to what 8000 
                         other men would say. We object to 
                         this entire line of questioning as 
                         argumentative and irrelevant badgering 
                         of the witness.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Government's objection is 
                         sustained, Lt. Kaffee, and I would 
                         remind you that you're now questioning 
                         marine officer with an impeccable 
                         service record.

                                     ROSS
                         Thank you judge.

               KAFFEE looks over at DAWSON. They share a brief moment before 
               KAFFEE turns back to KENDRICK.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating 
                         of Below Average on this last fitness 
                         report because you learned held been 
                         sneaking food to Private Barnes?
                              (to ROSS)
                         Not so fast.
                              (to KENDRICK)
                         Lieutenant?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Corporal Dawson was found to be Below 
                         Average because he committed a crime.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What crime did he commit?
                              (beat)
                         Lieutenant Kendrick?
                              (beat)
                         Dawson brought a hungry guy some 
                         food. What crime did he commit?

                                     KENDRICK
                         He disobeyed an order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And because he did, because he 
                         exercised his own set of values, 
                         because he made a decision about the 
                         welfare of a marine that was in 
                         conflict with an order of yours, he 
                         was punished, is that right?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? 
                         After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't 
                         being asked to secure a hill... or 
                         advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely 
                         a marine of Dawson's intelligence 
                         can be trusted to determine on his 
                         own, which are the really important 
                         orders, and which orders might, say, 
                         be morally questionable.
                              (beat)
                         Lt. Kendrick?
                              (beat)
                         Can he? Can Corporal Dawson determine 
                         on his own which orders he's gonna 
                         follow?
                              (pause)

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, he can not.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A lesson he learned after the Curtis 
                         Barnes incident, am I right?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I would think so.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You know so, don't you, Lieutenant.

                         Lieutenant Kendrick, one final 
                         question: if you ordered Dawson to 
                         give Santiago a code red...

                                     ROSS

                         I told those men not to touch 
                         Santiago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         -- is it reasonable to think that he 
                         would've disobeyed you again?

                                     ROSS
                         Lieutenant, don't answer that.

                         You don't have to, I'm through.

               ROSS doesn't even wait before he says --

                         Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order 
                         Corporal Dawson and Private Downey 
                         to give Willy Santiaga code red?

               But KENDRICK isn't listening -- he's glaring at Kaffee.

               JO and KAFFEE. KAFFEE's pumped and shooting baskets as Sam 
               walks in with some bound papers under his arm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's the word?

                                     SAM
                         This is the tower chief's log for 
                         that night. Jessep was telling the 
                         truth. The six a.m. flight was the 
                         first plane out.

               KAFFEE lets the ball drop out of his hands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let me see that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A MOTEL - NIGHT

               A SEDAN, with U.S. MARSHALL stenciled on the door, sits in 
               front of one of the rooms, and the two FEDERAL AGENTS inside 
               the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEE'S CAR pulls next 
               to them and KAFFEE jumps out.

               AGENT #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to KAFFEE --

                                     AGENT #1
                         Workin' late, lieutenant?

               KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The 
               door opens and KAFFEE walks into

               INT. MOTEL ROOM

               HE tosses the log book on the table.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There was no flight out at eleven 
                         o'clock. What the fuck are you trying 
                         to pull?

                                     MARKINSON
                         The first flight stateside left 
                         Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived 
                         at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, 
                         at a few minutes past two.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then why the hell isn't it listed in 
                         the Tower Chief's log?!

                                     MARKINSON
                         Why the hell did you think it would 
                         be?!!

               KAFFEE is silent. And now it begins to sink in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you telling me?
                              (beat)
                         He fixed the log book?

               Setback. Big setback.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Well, maybe he can make it so a plane 
                         didn't take off, but I can sure as 
                         hall prove that one landed. I'll get 
                         the log book from Andrews.

               MARKINSON says nothing. But his face says that KAFFEE was 
               born yesterday.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; beat)
                         He made an entire flight disappear?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Nathan Jessep is about to be named 
                         Director of Operations for the 
                         National Security Council. You don't 
                         get to that position without knowing 
                         how to side-step a few land mines.
                              (beat)
                         And putting me on the stand isn't 
                         gonna make him step on one.

               KAFFEE stares at him.

               Then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off 
               the table, and heads for the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're taking the stand. Thursday.

               KAFFEE leaves.

               HOLD on MARKINSON.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT

               KAFFEE'S APARTMENT later that night and SAM and J0 have just 
               heard the report him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There's gotta be someone who can 
                         testify to the flight. A ground crew 
                         member. Someone.

                                     SAM
                         Do you have any idea how many planes 
                         take off and land every day? A kid 
                         from the ground crew isn't gonna 
                         remember a flight that landed four 
                         weeks ago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson 
                         on the stand and we'll deal with 
                         Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago 
                         and he'll testify to the forged 
                         transfer order. That'll be enough. 
                         That and Downey's testimony really 
                         oughta be enough.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE HOLDING ROOM - DAY

               Jo is working with DOWNEY. He sits on a mock witness stand.

                                     JO
                         Private Downey, why did you go into 
                         Santiago's room on the night of the 
                         6th?

                                     DOWNEY
                         To give Private Santiago a Code Red, 
                         ma'am.

                                     JO
                         And why did you give him a Code Red?

                                     DOWNEY
                         I was ordered to give him a Code Red 
                         by the Executive officer for Rifle 
                         Security Company Windward, Lieutenent 
                         Jonathan James Kendrick.

               JO smiles.

                                     JO
                         You're gonna do fine.

               DOWNEY smiles.

                         You think they'll let us go back to 
                         our platoon soon, ma'am?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         Absolutely.

                         You remember the order of the 
                         questions?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes.

                         Are you sure?

                         Yes.

                         understand something.

                         I'm just saying go slow.

                         I'm gonna go slow.

                                     JO
                         Okay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright.

                         And get him off as fast as you can.

               They turn and head into the courtroom as we HEAR MARKINSON 
               in VOICE OVER...

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MARKINSON'S ROOM - DAY

               MARKINSON is writing a letter and we HEAR it in V.O.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         I was William's company commander.  
                         I knew your son vaguely, which is to 
                         say I knew his name...

               And while we continue to HEAR Markinson's voice writing the 
               letter, we begin a SERIES OF SHOTS: MARKINSON is getting 
               into his class A dress uniform, complete with medals, side 
               arm, and military dress sabre.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         In a matter of time, the trial of 
                         the two man charged with your son's 
                         death will be concluded, and seven 
                         men and two women whom you've never 
                         met will try to offer you an 
                         explanation as to why William is 
                         dead. For my part, I've done as much 
                         as I can to bring the truth to light.

               MARKINSON is finished dressing. He stands in the middle of 
               the motel room.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                              (continuing)
                         And the truth is this: your son is 
                         dead for only one reason. I wasn't 
                         strong enough to stop it.

               MARKINSON takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the 
               trigger.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         Always, Captain Matthew Andrew 
                         Markinson.

               MARKINSON puts the pistol in his mouth --

               EXT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey.

                         Private, I want you to tell us one 
                         last time: Why did you go into Private 
                         Santiago's room on the night of August 
                         6th?

                         A code red was ordered by my platoon 
                         commander, Lt. Jonathan James 
                         Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.
                              (to ROSS)

                         Private, for the week of 2 August, 
                         the switch log has you down at Post 
                         39, is that correct?

                                     DOWNEY
                         I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that 
                         log pretty good.

                                     ROSS
                         How far is it from Post 39 to the 
                         Windward barracks?

                                     DOWNEY
                         It's a ways, sir, it's a hike.

                                     ROSS
                         About how far by jeep?

                                     DOWNEY
                         About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Have you ever had to walk it?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The 
                         Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what 
                         we call the fella who drops us at 
                         our posts and picks us up... also, 
                         'cause he can get girls in New York 
                         City -- the Pick-up Private got a 
                         flat...

               At the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something 
               down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at 
               it:

               "Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it 
               back to KAFFEE.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
                         ...Right at 39. He pulled up and 
                         blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. 
                         The two of us had to double-time it 
                         back to the barracks.

                                     ROSS
                         And if it's ten or fifteen minutes 
                         by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a 
                         good hour by foot, am I right?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, 
                         sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Not bad. Now you say your assault on 
                         Private Santiago was the result of 
                         an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in 
                         your barracks room at 16:20.

               KAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about 
               it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir.

               JO. Helpless. Panicked.

                                     ROSS
                         But you just said that you didn't 
                         make it back to Windward Barracks 
                         until 16:45.

               DOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked 
               before.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir?

                                     ROSS

                         barracks until 16:45, then how could 
                         you be in your room at 16:20?

                                     DOWNEY
                              (pause)
                         You see sir, there was a flat tire.

                                     ROSS
                         Private, did you ever actually hear 
                         Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?

               KAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing 
               he can do about it. And he knows it.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (pause)
                         No, sir.

               Jo leaps to her feet.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     DAWSON
                         Private. Answer the Lieutenant's 
                         question.

               The room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never 
               seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this 
               with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right 
               thing.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order 
                         by my squad leader, Lance Corporal 
                         Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine 
                         Corps. And I followed it.

               ROSS let's it hang. He looks over at KAFFEE. KAFFEE won't 
               meet his eyes.

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               JO and SAM are sitting in silence. It's dark outside.

                                     JO
                         Where do you think he is?

               SAM doesn't know. JO is beside herself, and trying to keep 
               it together.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         As far as Downey was concerned, it 
                         was an order from Kendrick. It didn't 
                         matter that he didn't hear it first 
                         hand. He doesn't distinguish between 
                         the two.

               SAM understands, but he doesn't say anything. The door opens 
               and KAFFEE walks in.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Danny. I'm sorry.

               KAFFEE seems to be in an incredibly normal mood.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't worry about it.

                                     JO
                         Sam and I were just talking about 
                         how all we really have to do is call 
                         some witnesses who'll talk about 
                         implied orders... or maybe we put 
                         Downey back on the stand before we 
                         get to Dawson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Maybe if we work at it we can get 
                         Dawson charged with the Kennedy 
                         assassination.

               JO studies KAFFEE for a moment.

                                     JO
                         Are you drunk?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (a simple answer)
                         Pretty much. Yeah.

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a 
                         long night's work ahead.

                                     KAFFEE
                         She's gonna make coffee. That's nice.
                              (beat)
                         He wasn't in his room.
                              (Kaffee's amazed)
                         He wasn't even there.
                              (beat)
                         That was an important piece of 
                         information, don't you think?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         Danny, it was just a setback. I'm 
                         sorry. But we'll fix it and then 
                         move on to Markinson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Markinson's dead.

               JO and SAM are frozen.

               KAFFEE says this with no particular feeling one way or the 
               other.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You really gotta hand it to those 
                         Federal Marshals, boy.
                              (he almost has to 
                              laugh)
                         It's not like he hanged himself by 
                         his shoelaces or slashed his wrists 
                         with a concealed butter knife. This 
                         guy got, into full dress uniform, 
                         stood in the middle of that room, 
                         drew a nickle plated pistol from his 
                         holster, and fired a bullet into his 
                         mouth.

               Jo and SAM don't say anything.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Anyway, since we seem to be out of 
                         witnesses, I thought I'd drink a 
                         little.

                                     JO
                         I still think we can win.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then maybe you should drink a little.

                                     JO
                         Look, we'll go to Randolph in the 
                         morning and make a motion for a 
                         continuance. 24 hours.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Why would we want to do that?

                                     JO
                         To subpoena Colonel Jessep.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What?

                                     JO
                         Listen for a second --

                                     KAFFEE
                         No.

                                     JO
                         Just hear me out --

                                     KAFFEE
                         No. I won't listen to you and I won't 
                         hear you out. Your passion is 
                         comforting, Jo. It's also useless. 
                         Private Downey needed a trial lawyer 
                         today.

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         You chicken-shit. You're gonna use 
                         what happened today as an excuse to 
                         give up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It's over!

                                     JO
                         Why did you ask Jessep for the 
                         transfer order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you --

                                     JO
                         In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for 
                         the transfer order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does it matter --

                                     JO
                         Why?!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I wanted the damn transfer order!

                                     JO
                         Bullshit! You could've gotten it by 
                         picking up the phone and calling any 
                         one of a dozen departments at the 
                         Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer 
                         order. You wanted to see Jessep's 
                         reaction when you asked for the 
                         transfer order. You had an instinct. 
                         And it was confirmed by Markinson. 
                         Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the 
                         stand and end this thing!

                                     KAFFEE
                         What possible good could come from 
                         putting Jessep on the stand?

                                     JO
                         He told Kendrick to order the Code 
                         Red.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He did?! Why didn't you say so!? 
                         That's qreat! And of course you have 
                         proof of that.

                                     JO
                         I --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Ah, I keep forgetting: You were sick 
                         the day they taught law at law school.

                                     JO
                         You put him on the stand and you get 
                         it from him!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes. No problem. We get it from him.
                              (to SAM)
                         Colonel, isn't it true that you 
                         ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

                                     SAM
                         Look, we're all a little --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sorry, your time's run out. What 
                         do we have for the losers, Judge? 
                         Well, for our defendants it's a 
                         lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. 
                         And for defense counsel Kaffee? That's 
                         right -- it's -- a court -- martial. 
                         Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing 
                         a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt.  
                         Kaffee will have a long and prosperous 
                         career teaching typewriter maintenance 
                         at the Rocco Columbo School for Women.  
                         Thank you for playing "Should We or 
                         Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of 
                         the Galacticly Stupid".

               And with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk. A 
               ton of papers, books, files, etc., falls to the floor.

               There's dead silence. Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE breathing 
               after this exhausting outburst.

               Finally...

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry I lost you your set of 
                         steak knives.

               Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. The door slams 
               behind her.

               KAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word.

               SAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the 
               stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk.

               KAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Stop cleaning up.

               But Sam continues.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Sam. Stop cleaning up.

               SAM stops and sits in a chair. KAFFEE sits on the couch.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You want a drink?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah.

               SAM takes a swig from the bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Is your father proud of you?

                                     SAM
                         Don't do this to yourself.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores 
                         the shit outta the neighbors and the 
                         relatives. "Sam, made Law Review.  
                         He's got a big case he's making -- 
                         He's arguing making an argument."
                              (pause)
                         I think my father would've enjoyed 
                         seeing me graduate from law school.

                         I think he would've liked that... an 
                         awful lot.

                                     SAM
                         Did I ever tell you that I wrote a 
                         paper on your father in college?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah?

                                     SAM
                         He was one of the best trial lawyers 
                         ever.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes he was.

                                     SAM
                         And if I were Dawson and Downey and 
                         I had a choice between you or your 
                         father to represent me in this case, 
                         I'd take you any day of the week and 
                         twice on Sunday. You should have 
                         seen yourself thunder away at 
                         Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Would you put Jessep on the stand?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think my father would've?

                                     SAM
                         With the evidence we've got? Not in 
                         a million years. But here's the thing --
                         and there's really no way of getting 
                         around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee 
                         nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel 
                         for the defense in the matter of 
                         U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So 
                         there's only one question. What would 
                         you do?

               We HOLD on the two of them for a moment, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

               JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing 
               her best not to fall apart.

               TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's 
               CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down 
               alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Joanne.

               JO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with 
               her.

               JO starts walking faster.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Jo, we look ridiculous.
                              (to SAM)
                         Stop the car.

               KAFFEE hops out and calls --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Joanne.

               JO keeps walking.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I apologize. I was angry and... I'm 
                         sorry about what I said.

               But JO'S still walking.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; calling)
                         I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand.

               She stops. She turns around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON

               A nerf ball bounces off the wall.

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room. For 
               hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea.  
               KAFFEE's mind seems to be on his basketball game.

                                     JO
                         I say we hit him with the phoney 
                         transfer order.

                                     SAM
                         What's the transfer order without a 
                         witness?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have a witness.

                                     SAM
                         A dead witness.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And in the hands of a lesser attorney, 
                         that'd be a problem.

                                     SAM
                         Look at this. Last night he was 
                         swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he 
                         can leap tall buildings in a single 
                         bound.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. 
                         Both of you.

               He sees that SAM and JO were already sitting down.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Good.
                              (beat)
                         Jessep told Kendrick to order a code 
                         red. Kendrick did, and our clients 
                         followed the order. The cover-up 
                         isn't our case. To win, Jessep has 
                         to tell the jury that he ordered the 
                         code red.

                                     SAM
                         And you think you can got him to 
                         just say it?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I think he wants to say it. I think 
                         he's pissed off that he's gotta hide 
                         from us. I think he wants to say 
                         that he made a command decision and 
                         that's the end of it. He eats 
                         breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 
                         Cubans who are trained to kill him, 
                         and no one's gonna tell him how to 
                         run his base. Least of all the pushy 
                         broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard 
                         clown. I need to shake him and put 
                         him on the defensive.

               SAM and JO are silent for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         That's it? That's the plan?

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's the plan.

                                     SAM
                         You're gonna trip Jessep and he's 
                         gonna confess.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna 
                         lead him right where he's dying to 
                         go.

                                     SAM
                         And how are you gonna do that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have no idea. I need my bat.

                                     JO
                         What?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (looking around)
                         I need my bat. I think better with 
                         my bat. Where's my bat?

                                     JO
                         I put it in the closet.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You put it in the closet.

               KAFFEE heads to the closet.

                                     JO
                         I was tripping over it.

                                     KAFFEE (O.S.)
                         Don't ever put a bat in a closet.

                                     JO
                         He thinks better with his bat?

               And we go to KAFFEE AT THE CLOSET.

               OFFSCREEN WE HEAR

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         I can understand that. I used to 
                         have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I 
                         could never do my home work without 
                         him.

               During this, KAFFEE's opened the closet door. He reaches in 
               to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something:

               His clothes.

               His uniforms and his civilian clothes. Hanging neatly along 
               the bar. He stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads 
               back through the living room towards the front door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Stay here, I'm going to the office 
                         for a while.

               KAFFEE storms out.

                                     SAM
                         Boy, he does think better with that 
                         bat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A small room at the end of a corridor at the office. KAFFEE 
               stands over a printer and watches it spit out something he's 
               been waiting for. He tears the printout off and we

               INT. KAFFEE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               KAFFEE is looking over the computer printout. From what we 
               can tell, it resembles a large, military coded phone bill.

               KAFFEE picks up the phone and dials.

                                     KAFFEE

                         I've gotta go out to Andrews.

               The day's session is going to begin in a few minutes. KAFFEE

                         He's on his way.

                         Did he got the guys?

                         Yes. Listen, can I talk to you for a 
                         second?

                         I think he's gonna have his hands 
                         full today.

                              (continuing)
                         If you feel like... if you feel 
                         like... You could get in trouble.
                              (beat)
                         I'm special counsel for internal 
                         affairs, and I'm telling you, you 
                         could get in a lot of trouble.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why Lt. Commander Galloway... are 
                         you suggesting I back off a material 
                         witness?

                                     JO
                         If you think you can't get him.
                              (beat)
                         Yeah.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you think I can get him?

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         I think it doesn't matter what I 
                         think. I'm an administrator.
                              (beat)
                         I can't seem to defend people.

               KAFFEE takes that in. He picks up his briefcase and grabs 
               his jacket.

               Then he turns to JO.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're my hero, Joanne.
                              (beat)
                         From the first day, you were a lawyer.
                              (beat)
                         Live with that.

               And in VOICE OVER we HEAR the SERGEANT AT ARMS.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS (V.O.)
                         All rise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               Everyone stands at attention as RANDOLPH enters. SAM is 
               missing.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         Call your witness.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Where's Sam?

                                     JO
                         He'll be here.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lieutenant, call your witness.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.

               JESSEP is escorted in through a side door. He's wearing his 
               dress uniforms, adorned with the appropriate medals.

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel, do you solemnly swear that 
                         the testimony you will give in this 
                         General Court-Martial will be the 
                         truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
                         but the truth so help you God?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes I do.

                                     ROSS
                         Would you state your name, rank, and 
                         current billet for the record please, 
                         air?

                                     JESSEP
                         Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding 
                         officer, Marine Ground Forces, 
                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

                                     ROSS
                         Thank you, sir, would you have a 
                         seat, please.

               JESSEP sits.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, when you learned of 
                         Santiago's letter to the NIS, you 
                         had a meeting with your two senior 
                         officers, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan 
                         Kendrick, and the Company Commander, 
                         Captain Matthew Markinson.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And at present, Captain Markinson is 
                         dead, is that right?

                                     ROSS
                         Objection. I'd like to know just 
                         what defense counsel is implying?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm implying simply that, at present, 
                         Captain Markinson is not alive.

                                     ROSS
                         Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need 
                         to appear in this courtroom to confirm 
                         that information.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I just wasn't sure if the witness 
                         was aware that two days ago, Captain 
                         Markinson took his own life with a 
                         .45 caliber pistol.

               And from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting 
               two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the 
               AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the 
               defense table.

               Over this we HEAR --

                                     RANDOLPH (O.S.)
                         The witness is aware, the Court is 
                         aware, and now the jury is aware. We 
                         thank you for bringing this to our 
                         attention. Move on Lieutenant.

               SAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks 
               over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: 
               Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of 
                         this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick 
                         an order, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         I told Kendrick to tell his men that 
                         Santiago wasn't to be touched.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And did you give an order to Captain 
                         Markinson as well?

                                     JESSEP
                         I ordered Markinson to have Santiago 
                         transferred off the base immediately.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JESSEP
                         I felt that his life might be in 
                         danger once word of the letter got 
                         out.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Grave danger?

                                     JESSEP
                         Is there another kind?

               KAFFEE holds up a document from his table.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have the transfer order that you 
                         and Markinson co-signed, ordering 
                         that Santiago be lifted on a flight 
                         leaving Guantanamo at six the next 
                         morning. Was that the first flight 
                         off the bass?

                                     JESSEP
                         The six a.m. flight was the first 
                         flight off the base.

               KAFFEE nods and decides to move on.

               JESSEP steals a quick glance at the two AIRMEN sitting out 
               in the courtroom.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, you flew up to Washington 
                         early this morning, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I notice you're wearing your Class A 
                         appearance in dress uniform for court 
                         today.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         As are you, Lieutenant.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you wear that uniform on the 
                         plane?

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, is this dialogue 
                         relevant to anything in particular?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The defense didn't have an opportunity 
                         to depose this witness, your honor.  
                         I'd ask the Court for a little 
                         latitude.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         A very little latitude.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         I wore fatigues on the plane.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And you brought your dress uniform 
                         with you.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? 
                         Change of underwear?

                                     ROSS
                         Your honor.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to ROSS)
                         Is the Colonel's underwear a matter 
                         of national security?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Gentlemen.
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         You better get somewhere fast with 
                         this, Lieutenant.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir. Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         I brought a change of clothes and 
                         some personal items.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

               KAFFEE gets a document from his table.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         After Dawson and Downey's arrest on 
                         the night of the sixth, Santiago's 
                         barracks room was sealed off and its 
                         contents inventoried.
                              (reading)
                         Pairs of camouflage pants, 6

                         belts, 1 sweater --

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, is there a question 
                         anywhere in our future?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee, I have to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't 
                         packed.

               That landed. On the JURY, RANDOLPH, ROSS...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I'll tell you what, we'll get back 
                         to that one in a minute.

               JO hands KAFFEE the computer printout.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         This is a record of all telephone 
                         calls made from your base in the 
                         past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed 
                         to Washington, you made three calls.

               Handing Jessep the printout --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I've highlighted those calls in 
                         yellow. Do you recognize those 
                         numbers?

                                     JESSEP
                         I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in 
                         Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him 
                         know I'd be in town. The second call 
                         was to set up a meeting with 
                         Congressman Ramond of the House Armed 
                         Services Committee, and the third 
                         call was to my sister Elizabeth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why did you make that call, sir?

                                     JESSEP
                         I thought she might like to have 
                         dinner tonight.

                                     ROSS
                         Judge --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I'm gonna put a stop to this now.

               Jo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your honor, these are the telephone 
                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  
                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago 
                         wrote in nine months requesting, in 
                         fact begging, for a transfer.
                              (to JESSEP)
                         Upon hearing the news that he was 
                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
                         was so excited, that do you know how 
                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
                         Not one call to his parents saying 
                         he was coming home. Not one call to 
                         a friend saying can you pick me up 
                         at the airport. He was asleep in his 
                         bed at midnight, and according to 
                         you he was getting on a plane in six 
                         hours, yet everything he owned was 
                         hanging neatly in his closet and 
                         folded neatly in his footlocker. You 
                         were leaving for one day and you 
                         packed a bag and made three phone 
                         calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
                         Can you explain that? The fact is 
                         there was no transfer order. Santiago 
                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
                         right, Colonel.

                                     ROSS
                         Object. Your Honor, it's obvious 
                         that Lt. Kaffee's intention this 
                         morning is to smear a high ranking 
                         marine officer in the desperate hope 
                         that the mere appearance of 
                         impropriety will win him points with 
                         the jury. It's my recommendation, 
                         sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an 
                         official reprimand from the bench, 
                         and that the witness be excused with 
                         the Court's deepest apologies.

               RANDOLPH ponders this a moment.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (pause)
                         Overruled.

                                     ROSS
                         Your honor --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The objection's noted.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Colonel?

               Jessep's smiling...

               ...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Is this funny, sir?

                                     JESSEP
                         No. It's not. It's tragic.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you have an answer?

                                     JESSEP
                         Absolutely. My answer is I don't 
                         have the first damn clue. Maybe he 
                         was an early morning riser and he 
                         liked to pack in the nq. And maybe 
                         he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
                         educated man, but I'm afraid I can't 
                         speak intelligently about the travel 
                         habits of William Santiago.  What I 
                         do know is that he was set to leave 
                         the base at 0600. Now are these really 
                         the questions I was called here to 
                         answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
                         Please tell me you've got something 
                         more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
                         there's an ace up your sleeve. These 
                         two marines are on trial for their 
                         lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
                         hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
                         bill.
                              (beat)
                         Do you have any other questions for 
                         me, counselor?

               The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.

               KAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting 
               for him to do something...

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee?

               KAFFEE says nothing. He glances over to AIRMEN O'MALLEY and 
               PEREZ.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         Lieutenant, do you have anything 
                         further for this witness?

               KAFFEE doesn't respond. JESSEP gets up to leave.

                                     JESSEP
                              (standing)
                         Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.

               And JESSEP starts to leave, but he's stopped by --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you.

               JESSEP turns around.

                                     JESSEP
                         I beg your pardon.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not through with my examination. 
                         Sit down.

                                     JESSEP
                         Colonel.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's that?

                                     JESSEP
                              (to RANDOLPH)
                         I'd appreciate it if he addressed me 
                         as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've 
                         earned it.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Defense counsel will address the 
                         witness as Colonel or Sir.

                                     JESSEP
                              (to RANDOLPH)
                         I don't know what the hell kind of 
                         an outfit you're running here.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         And the witness will address this 
                         Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm 
                         quite certain I've earned it. Take 
                         your seat, Colonel.

               Jessep goes back to the stand.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         What would you like to discuss now! 
                         My favorite color?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was 
                         the first one off the base?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There wasn't a flight that left seven 
                         hours earlier and landed at Andrews 
                         Airforce Base at 2 a.m.?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lieutenant, I think we've covered 
                         this, haven't we?

               KAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as the 
               piece of paper that SAM scribbled on.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your Honor, these are the Tower 
                         Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay 
                         and Andrews Airforce Base. The 
                         Guantanamo log lists no flight that 
                         left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews 
                         log lists no flight that landed at 2 
                         a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense 
                         Exhibits "A" and "B".

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I don't understand. You're admitting 
                         evidence of a flight that never 
                         existed?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We believe it did, sir.
                              (glancing at the paper, 
                              then motioning to 
                              the AIRMEN)
                         Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil 
                         O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. 
                         They were working the ground crew at 
                         Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor, these men weren't on the 
                         list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, 
                         called specifically to refute 
                         testimony offered under direct 
                         examination.

               If you looked closely at JESSEP, you could see a drop of 
               sweat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I'll allow the witnesses.

                                     JESSEP
                         This is ridiculous.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, a moment ago --

                                     JESSEP
                         Check the Tower Logs for christ's 
                         sake.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll get to the airmen in just a 
                         minute, sir. A moment ago said that 
                         you ordered Kendrick to order his 
                         men not to touch Santiago.

                                     JESSEP
                         That's right.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And Kendrick was clear on what you 
                         wanted?

                                     JESSEP
                         Crystal.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance Kendrick ignored the order?

                                     JESSEP
                         Ignored the order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance he just forgot about it?

                                     JESSEP
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance Kendrick left your office 
                         and said, "The 'old man's wrong"?

                                     JESSEP
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When Kendrick spoke to the platoon 
                         and ordered them not to touch 
                         Santiago, any chance they ignored 
                         him?

                                     JESSEP
                         Have you ever spent time in an 
                         infantry unit, son?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Ever served in a forward area?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Ever put your life in another man's 
                         hands, ask him to put his life in 
                         yours?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         We follow orders, son. We follow 
                         orders or people die. It's that 
                         simple. Are we clear?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Are we clear?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Crystal.

               KAFFEE speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from 
               knowing you're about to drop your opponents

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; beat)
                         Colonel, I have just one more question 
                         before I call Airman O'Malley and 
                         Airman Perez: If you gave an order 
                         that Santiago wasn't to be touched, 
                         and your orders are always followed, 
                         then why would he be in danger, why 
                         would it be necessary to transfer 
                         him off the base?

               And JESSEP has no answer.

               Nothing.

               He sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.

                                     JESSEP
                         Private Santiago was a sub-standard 
                         marine. He was being transferred off 
                         the base because --

                                     KAFFEE
                         But that's not what you said. You 
                         said he was being transferred because 
                         he was in grave danger.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Yes. That's correct, but --

                                     KAFFEE
                         You said, "He was in danger". I said, 
                         "Grave danger". You said --

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes, I recall what --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I can have the Court Reporter read 
                         back your --

                                     JESSEP
                         I know what I said. I don't need it 
                         read back to me like I'm a damn --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then why the two orders?
                              (beat)
                         Colonel?
                              (beat)
                         Why did you --

                                     JESSEP
                         Sometimes men take matters into their 
                         own hands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir. You made it clear just a 
                         moment ago that your men never take 
                         matters into their own hands. Your 
                         men follow orders or people die. So 
                         Santiago shouldn't have been in any 
                         danger at all, should he have, 
                         Colonel?

               Everyone's sweating now. Everyone but KAFFEE.

                                     JESSEP
                         You little bastard.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess 
                         to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'd like an answer to the question, 
                         Judge.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Court'll wait for answer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If Kendrick told his men that Santiago 
                         wasn't to be touched, then why did 
                         he have to be transferred?

               Jessep is looking at O'MALLEY and PEREZ.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Colonel?

               JESSEP says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't 
                         he? Because that's what you told 
                         Kendrick to do.

                                     ROSS
                         Object!

                         Counsel.

               KAFFEE will plow through the objections of ROSS and the 
               admonishments of RANDOLPH.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And when it went bad, you cut these 
                         guys loose.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         That'll be all, counsel.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You had Markinson sign a phony 
                         transfer order --

                         You doctored the log books.

                         Damnit Kaffee!!

                         I'll ask for the forth time. You 
                         ordered --

                                     JESSEP
                         You want answers?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I think I'm entitled to them.

                                     JESSEP
                         You want answers?!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I want the truth.

                                     JESSEP
                         You can't handle the truth!

               And nobody moves.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Son, we live in a world that has 
                         walls. And those walls have to be 
                         guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna 
                         do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I 
                         have a greater responsibility than 
                         you can possibly fathom. You weep 
                         for Santiago and you curse the 
                         marines. You have that luxury. You 
                         have the luxury of not knowing what 
                         I know: That Santiago's death, while 
                         tragic, probably saved lives. And my 
                         existence, while grotesque and 
                         incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
                              (beat)
                         You don't want the truth. Because 
                         deep down, in places you don't talk 
                         about at parties, you want me on 
                         that wall. You need me there.
                              (boasting)
                         We use words like honor, code, 
                         loyalty... we use these words as the 
                         backbone to a life spent defending 
                         something. You use 'em as a punchline.
                              (beat)
                         I have neither the time nor the 
                         inclination to explain myself to a 
                         man who rises and sleeps under the 
                         blanket of the very freedom I provide, 
                         then questions the manner in which I 
                         provide it. I'd prefer you just said 
                         thank you and went on your way. 
                         Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a 
                         weapon and stand a post. Either way, 
                         I don't give a damn what you think 
                         you're entitled to.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (quietly)
                         Did you order the code red?

                                     JESSEP
                              (beat)
                         I did the job you sent me to do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you order the code red?

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         You're goddamn right I did.

               Silence. From everyone. RANDOLPH, ROSS, the M.P.'s, they're 
               all frozen. JO and SAM are likewise. JESSEP seems strangely, 
               quietly relieved. KAFFEE simply takes control of the room 
               now.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Please the court, I suggest the jury 
                         be dismissed so that we can move to 
                         an immediate Article 39a Session.  
                         The witness has rights.

               Silence.

               RANDOLPH looks to ROSS.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Ross?

               ROSS is frozen. He doesn't know what to do.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (as a friend)
                         Jack.

               ROSS looks at KAFFEE, then JESSEP, then nods his head "yes" 
               to RANDOLPH.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Sergeant at Arms will take the 
                         jury to an ante-room where you'll 
                         wait until further instruction.

               The SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of the 
               room.

                                     JESSEP
                         What the hell's going on?

               No one will say anything until the jurors are out of the 
               room.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to captain)
                         Captain, what the hell's going on? I 
                         did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm 
                         getting on a plane and going back to 
                         my base.

                         M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.

               The M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel 
               referred to as "the prisoner" before. They sure as hell have 
               never been asked to guard one.

                                     ROSS
                         Guard the prisoner.

                                     JESSEP
                         What the hell --

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel Jessep, you have the right 
                         to remain silent. Any statement you 
                         do make can be used against you in a 
                         trial by court-martial or other 
                         judicial or administrative proceeding.  
                         You have the right...

               ROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights, over --

                                     JESSEP
                         I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
                         that's what this is --
                              (to Ross)
                         Marine!
                              (Ross keeps going)
                         Marine!!
                              (Ross is doing his 
                              job.)
                         I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
                         that's what's happening? This -- I'm --
                         this is funny, you know that, this 
                         is --

               And JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but 
               for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP.  
               SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to Kaffee)
                         I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta 
                         your head and piss in your dead skull.  
                         You fucked with the wrong marine.

               ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights.

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel Jessep, do you understand 
                         those rights as I have just read 
                         then to you?

                                     JESSEP
                         I saved lives. That boy was -- there 
                         was a weak link. I saved lives, you 
                         hear me?

               The courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst. Jessep shakes 
               his head.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         You fuckin' people.
                              (beat)
                         You have no idea how to defend a 
                         nation.
                              (continuing; to KAFFEE)
                         All you did was weaken a country 
                         today, Kaffee. That's all you did. 
                         You put people in danger. Sweet 
                         dreams, son.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't call me son.
                              (beat)
                         I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the 
                         United States Navy. And you're under 
                         arrest you sonofabitch.

               KAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer, then remembers --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         The witness is excused.

               The M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices 
               DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a 
               marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE 
               takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat 
               from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               There's low murmur in the room as the JURORS are being led 
               back into their box.

               Everyone's in place.

               RANDOLPH enters.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Ten-hut.

               All rise. And sit when RANDOLPH sits.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Have the jurors reached a verdict?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         We have, sir.

               The SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the 
               FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH.

               KAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should 
               do the same. SAM and JO stand as well.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (reading)
                         On the charge of Murder, the Members 
                         find the defendants Not Guilty.

               It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but 
               they do.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing; reading)
                         On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit 
                         Murder, the Members find the 
                         defendants Not Guilty.

               RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming 
                         a United States Marine, the members 
                         find the defendants Guilty as Charged.

               A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH 
               continues reading.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing; reading)
                         The defendants are hereby sentenced 
                         by this court to time already served, 
                         and are ordered...

               RANDOLPH clears his throat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         ...And are ordered to be dishonorably 
                         discharged from the marine corps.
                              (pause)
                         This Court-Martial is adjourned.

               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Ten hut.

               All rise.

               RANDOLPH's gone.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                              (continuing)
                         Dismissed.

               The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their 
               handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day 
               at the office.

                                     DAWSON
                         Why?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I'm sorry.

                                     DAWSON
                         Why?!

                                     DOWNEY
                         I don't understand. Colonel Jessep 
                         said he ordered the Code Red.

                                     JO
                         I know, but --

                                     DOWNEY
                         Colonel Jessep said he ordered the 
                         Code Red, what did we do wrong?

                                     JO
                         It's not as simple as --

                                     DOWNEY
                         What did we do wrong?

                                     DAWSON
                         We did nothing wrong.

               SAM slaps his hands down on the table --

                                     SAM
                         Yes you did! A jury just said your 
                         conduct was unbecoming a marine. 
                         What does that mean?!

                                     DAWSON
                         You're the lawyer.

                                     SAM
                         You're the marine.

                                     DAWSON
                         Not anymore.

               SAM lets it hang. DAWSON is staring at SAM. His stare moves 
               slowly to the floor.

                                     DAWSON
                              (continuing)
                         I never meant to hurt Willy.

               DAWSON looks up at HIS PARENTS. The moment hangs there... 
               before

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Kaffee, I've gotta take these guys 
                         over to personnel for some paper 
                         work.

               KAFFEE nods.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                              (continuing; to Dawson 
                              & Downey)
                         Gentleman?

               DAWSON looks to KAFFEE. There's gotta be more. This can't be 
               it.

               But KAFFEE has nothing to say.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY walk to the SERGEANT AT ARMS and begin to 
               follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. But before 
               they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold!

               They stop and turn around.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         You don't need to wear a patch on 
                         your arm to have honor.

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE for a long moment.

                                     DAWSON
                         Ten-hut.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention.

                                     DAWSON
                              (continuing)
                         There's an officer on deck.

               DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.

               KAFFEE stares back. Then stands up straight and returns their 
               salute.

               With one last glance back at KAFFEE, DAWSON turns and walks 
               out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

               ROSS walks over to the defense table.

                                     ROSS
                         Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony 
                         Perez? What exactly were these guys 
                         gonna testify to?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna 
                         testify, under oath, that they have 
                         absolutely no recollection of 
                         anything.

               ROSS smiles.

                                     ROSS
                         Strong witnesses.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And very handsome, too, don't you 
                         think?

                                     ROSS
                         I'll see you around the campus.  
                         I've gotta go arrest Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Tell him I say "Hi".

                                     ROSS
                         Will do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE - DUSK

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are walking down the steps. The BAND is 
               practicing on the parade grounds.

                                     JO
                         What do you say we take the rest of 
                         the day off. Go out someplace. Sam? 
                         Champagne? Yoo-Hoo?

                                     SAM
                         Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home 
                         and talk to my daughter. I think

                         went to the movies on company time. 
                         What about you?

                              (pause)
                         So what do you say? How 'bout a 
                         celebration?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No. How 'bout a date. A real date. 
                         Dinner. Attractive clothes. The works.

                                     JO
                         Sounds good.  Who do you think I 
                         should call?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll pick you up at seven.

                                     JO
                         What are you gonna do now?

                         Williamson.
                              (beat)
                         Stand my post for a while.

               JO holds out her hand. KAFFEE shakes it. JO kisses him.

                                     JO
                         Wear matching socks.

               Jo splits off toward her building and KAFFEE keeps walking 
               toward the bleachers as we PULL BACK TO INCLUDE the almost 
               empty parade grounds and PULL BACK as to show the Washington

1   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                   1

    The saddest eyes you ever saw.

    We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for
    one of his paintings.

    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
    brilliantly.

    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban
    housewives are there too.

    And one older man.

    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
    successful company executive.

    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.

    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --

    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.

    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his
    work a moment, shakes his head.

                                GIRL STUDENT
               Don't give up.

                                LUTHER
               I never do.

                                GIRL STUDENT
               May I?

    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts
    thumbing through.

    The sketchbook as the pages turn.

    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The
    hands are better. Very skillful.

      The GIRL hands it back.    Impressed.

                                 GIRL STUDENT
                   You work with your hands, don't
                   you?

      An enigmatic smile.    Now, from that --


2     EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                          2

      A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here
      but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the
      houses neat and well tended.

      Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's
      afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.


3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3

      Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working
      class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man
      Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They
      are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.

                               LUTHER
                       (as they nod to
                         each other)
                Redhead.

                                RED
                Luther.
                       (as Luther hands
                        him a videotape)
                Your life would be a whole lot
                simpler if you could learn to
                operate a V.C.R.

                              LUTHER
                My only failing.

      As he turns --


4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4

      A street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended.
      Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He
      carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the
      market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.

                                                            3.

5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5

    A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.
    Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,
    bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front
    door.


6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6

    as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,
    lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food
    away --


7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7

    Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.
    Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
    himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it
    down.

    A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley
    sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
    another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan
    cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.
    Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.

    Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a
    photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little
    girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
    alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
    them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.

    Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks
    out the window.


8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8

    is visible.     Lovely.   Peaceful.


9   LUTHER                                                       9

    Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the
    hands and eyes and faces --

    -- we are looking at something totally different:   a
    mansion.

    HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.

    KEEP HOLDING.

    PULL BACK to reveal --

                                                               4.

10   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                  10

     In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.

     But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
     are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and
     power.

     We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.
     Totally deserted. Silence.

     Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO
     VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The
     lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides
     to a stop. Again, silence...

     HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There
     is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --


11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11

     A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
     dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
     begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --

     -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his
     entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last
     sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,
     so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught
     again.


12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12

     The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a
     backpack.

     The night is cool.

     He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is
     a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't
     gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.

     One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,
     in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.
     He makes no sound at all.


13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13

     Thick wood with reinforced steel.

     Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens
     it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer
     of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a
     key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the
     instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:

                                                             5.

14   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        14

     The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts
     to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down:
     forty, thirty-nine, thirty --

                                                CUT TO:


15   LUTHER                                                       15

     -- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more
     than six inches long --

     -- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
     in the foyer next to the front door.

     The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --

                                                CUT TO:


16   SECURITY DETECTOR                                            16

                                                CUT TO:


17   SCREWDRIVER                                                  17

     Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
     the security panel away.

     The BEEPING sound is constant --

     -- and getting louder.

     A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It
     has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to
     find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.

                                                CUT TO:

     probing with the wires into the heart of the security
     panel.

     The BEEPING is LOUDER still.

     The security panel. Luther is attempting delicate work
     and it's dark so it isn't easy but he continues to probe
     with the wires and --

     Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers
     -- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out
     clearly.

     A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security
     detector go from red to a warm looking green.

     Safe.

      He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again,
      unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work
      quickly, precisely.


25A   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        25A

      The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,
      moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again
      shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.

      It's as if he hadn't been there at all...


26    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    26

      Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
      vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it
      looked in the moonlight.

      A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past
      it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a
      late one, when the madness had him and things were
      sliding away. Very sad.

      Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --

      -- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an
      instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as
      if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if
      getting ready for his next museum session  --

      -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the
      third floor.


27    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT          27

      Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an
      overpowering sense of being alone --

      -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"
      moves on.


28    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

      Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.

      The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see
      a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby
      girl, the next one of the same child at three.

      We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she
      is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.

      Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,
      if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl

      These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy

      shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.

      happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil
      here. Now --

      PULL BACK to reveal --

      A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy
      holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.

      KEEP PULLING BACK.

      And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter
      is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.

      Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.

      Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he
      moves on.


29    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT              29

      Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,
      closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,
      takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.
      Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied
      bed.

      A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver
      clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop
      the other, several more photos of the happy couple --

      -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
      thick leather handle.

      Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large
      full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.

      Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,
      he's studying the mirror itself.

      He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
      and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             9.

     Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up
     the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at
     the large mirror, clicks once --

     -- and the mirror swings silently open.

     A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:
     There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
     mirror had been.

     Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote
     held in his hand.

     The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very
     carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he
     takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.

     Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
     backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed
     room --


30   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT                 30

     It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,
     piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables
     we'll get around to.

     Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.

     He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
     that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
     table.

     Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.
     First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large
     denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of
     slender boxes --

     The first box as Luther opens it.

     Jewelry.

     Into the duffel it goes.

     Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.    And
     still more. As he continues to do this --


31   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         31

     All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a
     friendly green.

     Now, from somewhere, a distant sound.   LAUGHTER?   Was it
     laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.

32    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     32

      Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the
      jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.

      Into the duffel they go.

      He takes a breath, glances around.    Perfect.

      Coins.   Antique ones.   They disappear into the duffel.

      Stamp books.   Gone into the swelling duffel.

      Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.     Not so
      perfect.


33    INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     33   *

      He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward
      the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two
      people. A man and a woman.

      Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No
      place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into
      the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door
      with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --


34    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     34

      -- Luther is alone in the darkness.

      A burst of LAUGHTER now.    Growing nearer still.

      Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,
      doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,
      Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...

      Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.

      HOLD.


35    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                            35

      Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside
      the open bedroom door.

      Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a
      WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.

      The Woman closes the bedroom door.

      Darkness again.

      And now the LAUGHING sound increases.    GIGGLING, really.

                                                           11.

36   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  36

     Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED
     but it is there. He is starting to perspire.


37   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         37

     The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --


38   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  38

     Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and
     it's over.

     Luther blinks, confused, looks around --

     -- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.

     The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is
     staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.

     Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he
     was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.

     Just a few feet away, just outside the door.

     Where things are clearly starting to heat up.

     Luther moves to the armchair, sits.    There is nothing to
     do now but wait. He settles in.


39   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         39

     They are staring at each other.

     We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.
     But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.

     This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.
     Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep
     blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered
     black dress. An expensive necklace.

     One more thing:   she is staggering drunk.

     The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome
     and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.

     Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the
     husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she
     is.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                12.

     Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.     He
     fills them, gives one to her.

     They touch glasses.    Down the hatch.   Tight laughter.

     He looks at her.

     She looks at him.    There's a lot of sexual tension in the
     air.

     But now he begins looking around, checking things out.
     She spots this.

                                 CHRISTY
                         (drunk)
                  It's okay -- I told him I was
                  sick -- anyway, he's gone --
                  relax...

     He nods then, more at ease.    And he blows her a kiss.

     She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him.
     Her body moving very slowly.

     He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches.     Now --


40   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      40

     Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.


41   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             41

     Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the
     room --

     What she's looking at:     the side table with the remote
     that opens the vault.


42   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      42

     Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table.


43   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             43

     The table and the remote waiting there.


44   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      44

     Luther, mouth dry...

45    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         45

      Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him;
      he takes her by the hand --

      -- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed
      together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get
      fancy, spin her with one arm --

      -- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose
      balance, separate.

      They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages
      to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in           *
      the drawer of the nightstand --                                   *


46    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  46

      Luther.   A genuine sigh of relief --

      -- which suddenly dies --


47    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         47

      Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with
      the necklace in her hand.


48    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  48

      Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch.


49    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         49

      Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into
      his tumbler, chugging it down and now...

      The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.


50    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  50

      Luther dead in the water because --


51    CHRISTY'S                                                    51

      pointing the goddam thing at him --

      -- and as she CLICKS it --

52    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                52

      Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught
      in the headlights --

      -- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find
      out why.


53    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       53

      Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned
      the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the
      clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.                      *

      Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies
      press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her
      breasts --

      -- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to
      say, "naughty, naughty" --

      -- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The
      dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She
      is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a
      smile.

      She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have
      always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And
      Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her
      back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples.
      Christy moans.


54    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                54

      Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes.

      But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more
      insistent.


55    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       55

      Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at
      Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket,
      reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his
      shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a
      moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her
      panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near
      the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at
      themselves.


56    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                56

      Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces
      are just a couple of feet away --

      as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she
      is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes
      close and --

      as his eyes are open --

      -- the look on his drunken face is scary.


58    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 58

      Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried.


59    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CHRISTY AND RICHMOND         59

      looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and
      looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at
      her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.


60    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 60

      Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied
      bed.


61    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        61

      The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their
      first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him
      like that, her eyes shut tight --


62    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 62

      Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut,
      they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the
      awful look from before is back, only worse, and then
      without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly --

      -- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and
      Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond
      smiles at her sweetly.

      Christy.   Shaking her head.

      Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly
      gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              16.

62   CONTINUED:                                                     62

     Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move
     onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him.

     Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully-
     handsome man.

     Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant
     young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger,
     reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth.

     It's a sweet moment.

     They smile.

     Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts
     and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is
     shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and
     she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she
     slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously,
     right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her
     lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor.

     Christy sits there stunned.

                             CHRISTY
                      (slurred)
               You fucking bastard.

     And on that --

     Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up.
     Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as
     she is on her feet --

     Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.


63   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                    63

     Luther, silently applauding.


64   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                           64

     Richmond, the air momentarily out of him,  falling
     drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just  a moment and
     clearly in pain, but he is a big man and  he is strong and
     he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both  are laboring on
     the floor and Christy kicks him again and  again --

     -- but he will not release her ankle.   Each kick only
     inflames his drunken rage.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

64   CONTINUED:                                                      64

                                RICHMOND
                         (very slurred --)
                  You little whore --

     And now they both try and stand.

     Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it
     quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he
     is on his feet he begins to strangle her.

     Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her
     fingers scratching deeply --

     -- but he will not let go.

     She twists and jerks her body --

     -- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her
     throat --

     -- and spreads his legs for better balance.

     The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches
     around for something, anything -- her fingers finally
     close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she
     slashes his right arm.

     Now he lets go.    And stares, stunned, at his bleeding
     arm.

     Then he crunches her flush in the   mouth, a brutal blow,
     and blood pours from her nose and   mouth and if she
     weren't so scared, maybe it would   have stopped her, but
     it doesn't -- because somehow she   manages to maintain
     balance --

     -- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.

     It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless.       He
     lies on his back, holding his crotch.

     But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face,
     stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her
     hand.

     And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --

     -- and she drops to her knees beside him --

     -- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her --

     -- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --

     -- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             18.

64   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              64

     -- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high
     above her head, the point aimed at his heart --

     -- and Richmond screams one time --

     -- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed
     men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway,
     GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before
     the opener reaches Richmond's heart...

     Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does --

     -- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack,
     mouth open --

     -- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has
     prepared him for this --

     -- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body
     loses strength, he tries to look away, can't --

     -- and this is what he sees --


66   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          66

     Christy, fighting for another instant of life --

     -- no chance --

     -- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes
     roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the
     rug, she collapses like a rag doll --

     -- and blood is everywhere.


67   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                   67

     Luther. Back in regular motion now.    Pale, barely able
     to breathe.


68   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          68

     The two well-dressed men in business suits.

     BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks
     like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating.
     But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He
     puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

     TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful
     shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He
     puts his gun away, goes to Christy.

     Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but
     now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages
     to pick up the bloody letter opener.

                                RICHMOND
                  Kill her?

     Collin, by the body, nods.

                                BURTON
                  No choice in the matter.

     His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked.

     Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He
     drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't.
     Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he
     passes out cold.

     Burton and Collin look at each other now.

                                BURTON
                  Jesus, Tim, what did we do?

                                COLLIN
                         (echoing Burton)
                  No choice in the matter.


69   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  69

     Luther, staring at it all. The shock is still there but
     so is something new: anger. And on that --


70   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         70

     GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door.
     Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart.
     Now she sees what's happened, stops dead.

     Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin.    It's
     very clear from the outset: these three are not
     friendly.

                                 COLLIN
                   Nothing to tell. He screamed.

                                 RUSSELL
                   And you heard no sounds of
                   violence 'til then?

                   Nothing we haven't heard before.

      Richmond, on the bed, out. Russell studies his face as
      Burton moves toward the telephone.

                              BURTON
                Maybe I should call the police
                now.

                       (beat -- starting to
                        move toward him)
                Take a second and just think about
                that.
                       (closing in on Burton,
                        furious)
                Think... real... fucking... hard.


      BURTON                                                           *

      He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.

                              BURTON
                       (backing away)
                Probably not a good idea.

                              RUSSELL
                       (taking charge)
                Okay -- here's what happened
                tonight -- poor Christy came home
                alone and interrupted a burglary.
                That sound logical?

                                                             21.

     Luther in the closet.    He nods.


72   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          72

     Burton and Collin nod, too.

                             RUSSELL
               We're going to have to sanitize
               this place.
                      (shaking Richmond)
               Alan, did you have sex with her?

     Richmond, eyes barely open.

                             RICHMOND
               ... Don'... 'member...

                             RUSSELL
               Bill, you're going to have to
               examine her.

                             BURTON
               I'm no gynecologist.

                             RUSSELL
                      (she takes nothing
                       from nobody)
               I just made you one.

     End of discussion.


73   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)                  73

     A clock on the side table beside the three clickers.

     There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.

     The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as
     before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has
     been made with clean sheets. There is a large black
     garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in
     Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.

     Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing
     putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.

     Everyone wears gloves.

     Everything that is incriminating is gone --

                                                   (CONTINUED)

     -- except the letter opener, which has been put in a
     clear plastic bag. Collin reaches for it, starts to dump
     it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.

                                RUSSELL
                  I'll take that.

                             COLLIN
                      (surprised)
               It's got their prints on it.

                             RUSSELL
                      (she holds out her
                       hand)
               Thanks for sharing.

     Collin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell
     puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table
     when suddenly --

     Richmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying
     out --

                             RICHMOND
               Gloria -- I killed her --

     Russell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down --

     -- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering
     and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall,
     uses the bed table to try to steady himself.


74   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  74

     Luther, stunned, staring.


75   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         75

     What he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from
     her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight.

     Russell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him
     from the room --

                             RUSSELL
               It's all going to be fine, Alan.

                             RICHMOND

               ... I'll take care of everything
               just like I always do.
                      (to Burton and Collin)
               Gentlemen?

     She gestures to leave.

     Burton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large
     plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and
     backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then --

     Collin stops dead.   He stares across at the bed table.


76   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  76

     Luther, holding his breath.

                              COLLIN
               Shit.

                              BURTON
               What?

     In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs
     Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm
     and leaves.

     Burton flicks the light out, closes the door.

     The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks
     beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.


78   EXT. MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                            78

     It's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond
     outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway.

     Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is
     last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he
     follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly --
     it makes a loud, solid sound.


79   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - LUTHER - NIGHT                         79

     The sound is barely audible.   He has been looking at his
     watch --

     The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The
     second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top.

     Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence.

     The WATCH face:   the sound is loud, like "60 Minutes."


80   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                    80

     Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the
     cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell
     free to open the back door.

     Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it,
     moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the
     road.

     The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries
     to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond
     comfortably stretched out on the back seat.


81   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 81

     The second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he
     moves into action.

     -- He points the clicker at the door --

     -- the door starts to swing open --

     -- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the
     bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door
     starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the
     clicker back inside.

     looks sadly down at her, continues on as we MOVE TO...

      pockets the necklace. Tense, he kneels, probes behind            *
      the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener!
      In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it.

      He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that
      has a view of the front of the house. He looks out,
      grimaces.


84    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                    84

      The cars are still there. Burton is visible helping
      Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the
      door. He and Burton move to the front doors.


85    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        85

      Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window
      slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around
      the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers --

      -- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the
      window.


86    EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - TOWNCAR - NIGHT                    86

      Collin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton
      and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond
      lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat.
      Russell --

      -- a moment of relief. She breathes deep.    And as
      Russell starts to open her purse --

      Luther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of
      the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn
      backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a
      moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and
      the backpack wedged against the corner of the window --

      -- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.

      Gloria Russell, as every nightmare she has ever had comes

      as she screams again --


92    EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - WINDOW - NIGHT              92

      Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the
      window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the
      rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he
      is in serious trouble and...

      Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear
      COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster --

      -- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s
      and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten,
      so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly
      flying.

      Russell, standing by the Towncar, staring in at the house
      and from the look on her face, you know she thinks her
      life might be over.


98    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    98

      Burton and Collin, racing up the second floor staircase
      toward the top.


99    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                99

      Luther, halfway down.


100   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      100

      Burton and Collin, tearing along the third floor
      corridor.


101   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                101

      Luther, ten feet off the ground now.


102   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                102

      The bedroom door, flying open.


103   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                103

      Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the
      rest of the way, hits the ground running.


104   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         104

      Burton, racing toward the window, Collin goes to the
      night table.


105   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                                105

      Luther, at the end of the house, turning a corner.


106   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         106

      Burton, staring out the window and Luther is gone.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                        28.

106   CONTINUED:                                                 106

                              BURTON
                   Shit!

      Collin, looking around the table and the letter opener is
      gone.

                              COLLIN
                   Shit!

      And without another word, they bolt out the door.


107   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                    107

      Luther, crashing through the field.   He is in wonderful
      shape --

      -- for a man his age.

      And he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough?


108   EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                             108

      The Towncar as Collin yanks something out of the glove
      compartment, and then he is racing off into the night
      after Burton who is a few steps ahead.


109   EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT                109   *

      Russell staring after them -- in the back seat, Richmond
      is in a half-slumber.


110   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                    110

      Luther, bursting out of the underbrush --

      -- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him --

      -- one hundred yards of open field.   He runs on.


111   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT          111

      as Collin catches up to the other man, tosses what he
      took from the glove compartment.

      Thermal goggles.

      They put them on, on the fly and...

                                                           29.

112   THERMAL POV                                                112

      The world ahead of them as they see it: their FIELD OF
      VISION now resembles a rough computer game. THERMAL
      IMAGES register in red, everything else is dark green.


113   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - LUTHER - NIGHT         113

      Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through
      the open field and...

      Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but
      they are moving faster --

      -- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight --

      -- but Collin can fly.

      And he begins to leave Burton behind.

      Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that
      spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and
      his breath coming in gasps and...

      Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just
      ahead is the open field and as he starts into it --


114   THERMAL POV                                                114

      What Collin sees: a THERMAL figure; a man running out of
      the open and then disappearing into the woods.


115   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT                  115

      The sight of the figure is enough to kick Collin into
      overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses
      the open area.


116   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                      116

      Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM
      now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances
      back --

      -- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it
      rocks him, drops him to his knees --


117   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT                  117

      Collin and he could be jet propelled.

                                                              30.

118   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         118

      Luther, forcing himself back to his feet and running
      again, giving it everything he has left and he's dodging
      through the trees now.


119   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NEAR WOODS - NIGHT                    119

      Burton, behind Collin, but he draws his gun anyway --

      Collin, in the woods, and his gun's drawn too --

      Luther, out of the woods and now his car is visible --

      Collin, in the woods but they're coming to an end.


120   THERMAL POV                                                   120

      The figure up ahead is approaching a car.


121   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                  121

      Luther, throwing the car door open, ripping off his
      backpack, tossing it inside, jumping in behind the wheel.


122   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         122

      Burton.   Pulling up, gasping terribly.   He sinks to one
      knee.

      Collin, out of the woods! -- Still amazingly without the
      least sign of tiring --

      -- and now there is a sound:   a CAR MOTOR STARTING.


123   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                  123

      Luther in his car, wheels spinning.


124   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         124

      Collin has his pistol ready but it's impossible to hit
      anything when you're running like this.


125   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT               125

      Luther, in the car, GUNNING AWAY.

                                                              31.

126   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                         126

      Collin.    Slowing.


127   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                  127

      The car.    A swirl of dust.

      The dust clears.

      The car rounds a corner, is gone.


128   EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NIGHT                                 128

      Collin.    He stands there, rips off his thermal goggles --

      -- and surprisingly, he smiles.

      Burton, getting to his feet, his breath still not steady.
      He takes his goggles off too as Collin approaches.

                               COLLIN
                        (still the smile)
                 I got his license number.

      Now on that --


129   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          129

      Russell -- back in the bedroom, with Burton and Collin
      who are moving around constantly, checking the place out.
      Things are just amazingly tense.

                               RUSSELL
                        (close to losing it)
                 Gee, guys, maybe it was the
                 bogeyman -- don't forget to check
                 under the bed --
                        (exploding)
                 -- You may have buried us! --

                               COLLIN
                 -- relax, I got his license
                 number, remember? --

                               RUSSELL
                        (whirling on him)
                 -- you think he's going to just
                 sit around waiting for us? --
                 Asshole --

                               COLLIN
                 -- take it easy, Miss Russell --

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                          (trying for calm)
                   -- everybody shut up, all right?

      He is staring at his reflection in the big mirror.      He
      crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug.

      The rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet.

                                 BURTON
                   Oh boy...

      Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror.

      The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open.


130   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     130

      All three going inside, looking around.    The chair, the
      looted shelves. The truth thuds home.

      Russell turns, looks out at the bedroom through the door.

                                 RUSSELL
                          (dead)
                   A two-way mirror.

      Silently, they move out into the bedroom.


131   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                            131

                          (no anger now)
                   -- it's all we've got -- and he's
                   got the letter opener -- blood,
                   fingerprints -- Jesus, think what

                       (gesturing around)
                -- it looks like he stole a whole
                bunch of money -- I'll tell you
                what he's going to do.
                       (beat)
                He's going to run like hell.

      And on that --


132   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                 132

      The saddest eyes you ever saw.

      It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old
      stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are
      there too. So are the suburban housewives.

      Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --

      -- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning
      the room.

      Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his
      sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not
      calm and peaceful.

      The guard checks the room again.

      Edgy, Luther still works away.

      The guard leaves.

      Luther gets set to do the same.


133   INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                         133

      Red, alone in his empty bar, sipping coffee.    It's before
      the place has opened for the day.

      Luther comes in the back.    Red slides the videocassette
      over, Luther pockets it.

                                 RED
                   Jordan beat us at the buzzer.

                                 LUTHER
                   Bad night.

      And as he turns, goes --

                                                               34.

134   EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY                         134

      A YOUNG WOMAN parking her car -- a high rocky area above
      the Potomac. Below, a jogging path is visible, full of
      runners.

      The Young Woman gets out, locks her car, starts down a
      narrow walk toward the joggers.

      She's in her mid-thirties. A good face.        And there's
      something familiar about her.


135   EXT. JOGGING PARK - DAY                                        135

      Luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path,
      studying the runners. Now he registers something:       and
      smiles.

      The Woman in her mid-thirties as she comes jogging along.
      She runs well.

      Luther.   An imperceptible straightening of his clothes.

      The jogger.    We realize who she is: the little girl in
      the photo on   Luther's dining room table. All grown up.
      Now her face   registers something: his presence. Her
      eyes go down   to the path, she increases her speed.

      Luther.   Waving, calling out.

                                LUTHER
                 Kate.
                         (as she runs on)
                 Kate.

      She slows, hesitates, stops.

      Kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge
      of the path as he approaches. The river flows behind
      them. Runners pass by.

      Beat.

                               LUTHER
                 Probably too late for me to take
                 it up.

      She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.

                                LUTHER
                 The jogging.

                                KATE (YOUNG WOMAN)
                 Ahh.

      Beat.

                                 LUTHER
                   Dumb way to start this, I guess.

      Beat.

                                 LUTHER
                   Wanted to talk to you.

                                 KATE
                   About?

                                 LUTHER
                   Believe it or not, the weather.
                          (as she waits)
                   Nights are starting to get cold.

                                 KATE
                   That happens this time of year.

      Luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.

                                 LUTHER
                   I was thinking of maybe
                   relocating. Someplace with a
                   kinder climate.
                          (nothing shows on
                           her face)
                   I just wanted to check it out with
                   you first...
                          (still nothing)
                   ... you're the only family I've
                   got.

      And on that --

      Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.

                                 KATE
                   Luther, you don't have me.

      The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you
      can't tell from his face.

136   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                             136

      Christy Sullivan's body.

      We're back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot
      of police activity -- people work around the corpse. The
      place is covered with black fingerprint powder.

      SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief
      Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he
      had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright,
      funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at
      him.

      He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is
      the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies
      Christy; sadly shakes his head.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                   -- some burglary.

      LAURA SIMON. Laura is early 30s, and the best lab
      technician Seth has ever known, and he knew some good
      ones in New York.

                   I wish my carpets were this clean.

                   Sorry, Seth, but the entire

                   Barbados two days ago.

                   all the blood patterns indicate

137   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - DAY                                      137

      Seth says nothing as he and Laura go in the vault.      Seth
      stares at the chair.

                                  LAURA SIMON
                   Looks like someone sat here -- but
                   I couldn't find any prints.
                          (lowering her voice --
                            indicating the one-way
                            mirror)
                   You think Sullivan holed up in the
                   chair and watched his wife
                   perform?

                   I hope not --
                          (shakes his head)
                   -- he's such a great man.

      He moves back into the bedroom.


138   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                             138

      Another cop is working on the wall by the bed table where
      a hole the size and shape of a bullet is visible.

      The cop nods.

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                   Looks like he tried to strangle

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                   He also inspected her vagina.

      As he stares around, baffled.


139   EXT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APT. BUILDING - DAY                 139

      A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than
      we've seen thus far. Afternoon now.

      An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's
      slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears
      a battered hat. As he goes inside --


140   INT. BUILDING - FOYER/MAIL AREA - DAY                        140

      The salesman is opening a mail slot with the name
      "Hawthorne" on the outside. A good bit of mail, most of
      it unsolicited. Hawthorne pockets it, unlocks the foyer,
      heads toward the elevator.


141   INT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY                                141

      The elevator and Hawthorne slowly getting out, heading
      toward a corner apartment, taking out some keys --

      -- there are three locks on the door... he takes out
      keys --

                                                             40.

142   INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY                     142

      Hawthorne walks in, puts the suitcases down, flings his
      hat toward a long sofa --

      -- it's Luther and this, we will come to learn, is what
      he keeps as his safe house. It's neatly furnished,
      modern and clean.

      Now he moves quickly --

      -- first he opens a suitcase -- it contains his full
      backpack from the robbery --

      -- then he opens a locked closet door, revealing a very
      large and sophisticated safe. As he begins to work the
      dial --


143   INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)             143

      -- the TV ON in the living room as he slides the video
      cassette Red gave him into his machine. Everything has
      been put away.

      The TV as Michael Jordan is introduced to the crowd --

      Luther sits, nurses a beer, watches intently...


144   INT. MORGUE - DAY                                            144

      An old man silently weeping.

      This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era.    A
      self-made billionaire. Remarkably, the man has few
      enemies.

      At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once
      handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.

      We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the
      wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.

      He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers
      her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and
      desolate, stares at her once joyous face.

      PULL BACK to reveal --


145   INT. MORGUE - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY                         145

      Seth Frank, studying Walter THROUGH a two way mirror.
      Seth is moved at depth of the old man's grief. Anyone
      would be. Walter slowly rises --

                                                              41.

      SANDY LORD waiting in an anteroom as Walter enters...

      Sandy Lord is Walter Sullivan's lawyer.     He is 60,
      abrasive, powerful.

      Sandy moves to Walter, gestures toward the front door.
      Seth appears through another door, intercepts them.

                minds.

                   I'd been married to my Rebecca for
                   forty-seven years and when she
                   died, I decided I never wanted
                   that pain again. One thing I knew
                   about Christy: she was going to
                   outlive me.

                                 SANDY LORD
                   I think that's enough for today.

      Takes Walter's arm.

                 obviously I can't make it, but I'm
                 sure everyone will understand.

      Humiliated.

                               WALTER SULLIVAN
                 I'd hoped I could satisfy her...
                 but you know... she had needs and
                 she didn't want to go behind my
                 back... she suggested the chair...
                 she hoped I might get to like
                 sitting there...
                        (beat)
                 ... I didn't...
                        (takes a breath)
                 I've tried for eighty years to
                 live a decent life. I've given a
                 billion dollars to charity. If
                 this comes to trial, none of that
                 will be remembered -- I'll just go
                 out as the joke of the world.

      Seth.   He closes his notebook.

                              SETH
                I understand, sir; I'll do what I
                can.

                       (beat)
                Will you listen to me whine?
                Please forgive me, Mr. Frank.
                Just do your job.
                       (beat)
                And I'll do mine.

      Walter slowly moves to the door.    Seth watches him.
      Sadly...


147   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR                                 147

      A gorgeous SHOT of a very famous place.    The sun is
      setting. It all looks magical.

                                                             44.

148   INT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO - NIGHT                     148

      A room filled with well-dressed men and women. Formal
      attire. The  rich and the famous. But the only one we
      recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with
      several other men. Now, someone says his name.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                Sandy.
                       (as Sandy turns)
                Is there anything I can do?

                                 SANDY LORD
                Mr. President.

      And on those words -- The 44th President of the United
      States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He
      is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is,
      also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in
      American history, three years into a brilliant first
      term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes.

      His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen
      him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of
      a dark Towncar.

                              RICHMOND
                Take a walk with me.

      He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman
      moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is
      GLORIA RUSSELL.

      Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are
      their names and they are the best the Secret Service has
      to offer.


149   INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                          149

      The group, as they leave the room, come to a wide
      corridor.

                              RICHMOND
                Tell me about Walter -- how is he?

                              SANDY LORD
                Eighty and alone, Mr. President.

                              RICHMOND
                He understands officially my hands
                are tied?

                              SANDY LORD
                Mr. President, he's touched at
                your concern.

                                 RICHMOND
                   Any news of the killer?
                          (as Sandy indicates
                          "no")
                   Well, why isn't there? Who's in
                   charge of the case?

                                 SANDY LORD
                   Top man -- eight years homicide
                   work in New York. But I
                   understand how you feel -- it's
                   hard to be patient.

                                 RICHMOND
                          (terribly upset)
                   No one understands how I feel --
                   I'm supposed to have all this
                   power but I can't help my oldest
                   friend -- you know and I know that
                   more than any man alive Walter
                   Sullivan put me here -- and now
                   when he most needs me, he must
                   feel abandoned.


      CLOSEUP - RICHMOND                                              *

      On fire --

                                 RICHMOND
                   -- I'll hold a press conference --
                   and I'll have Walter come -- and I
                   will embrace him before the world.

      Sandy.   Listening.    Moved.

                                 SANDY LORD
                   He'll treasure that, Mr.
                   President. What a generous
                   gesture. Thank you. Thank you.

      And he reaches out, shakes Richmond's hand, squeezes
      Richmond's arm and -- Richmond -- suddenly screaming in
      pain -- Sandy pulls back, shocked. Richmond looks
      embarrassed.

                                 RICHMOND
                          (quick smile)
                   Damn tennis elbow is killing me.

      And on that --

                                                             46.

150   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT                     150

      Richmond, immediately after, and he sure isn't smiling
      now -- he storms toward the Oval Office, Russell, Burton
      and Collin hurrying to keep up.


151   INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT                                     151

      Burton opens the door for them, closes it once they're
      inside.

                      (throws off his jacket,
                       turns on Russell)
               This thing's worse, Gloria. I
               need to see a doctor.

                             RUSSELL
               The country would have to be
               informed, Mr. President.

                              RICHMOND
               What happened to my right to
               privacy?
                      (rolls up his sleeve,
                        studies his cut)
               I think she nicked a tendon.

                              RUSSELL
                Burton says it's a flesh wound --

                              RICHMOND
                       (to Burton)
                -- when did you become such an
                expert, Bill? -- Ever been
                wounded? --

                              BURTON

                Yes, sir. Many times.

      The fireplace.   Richmond goes to it, rubs his arm, stares
      at the flames.

                              RUSSELL
                Are you serious about that press
                conference, Alan?

                              RICHMOND
                Of course I am -- Walter's been
                like a father to me.

                              RUSSELL
                Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home
                for it?

      Richmond, turning from the fire now, quietly.

                                 RICHMOND
                   I think Mrs. Richmond's mission to
                   help the poor in Asia should not
                   be interrupted.
                          (takes a breath,
                           starts to button
                           his shirt)
                   We know anything yet?

                                 RUSSELL
                   We checked his license plate -- he
                   stole the car from a police
                   impoundment lot.

                                 RICHMOND
                   We're not dealing with a fool
                   here.
                          (gestures toward his
                           jacket, as Russell
                           helps him into it)
                   Has he initiated contact?

                                 RUSSELL
                   Burton doesn't think he will.

                                  RICHMOND
                   I agree.
                          (checking himself
                            in a mirror)
                   Sorry about my behavior -- won't
                   happen again; think of it as a
                   blip on the screen. And as far as
                   I'm concerned, so is he.

                                RUSSELL
                  He could be a little more than
                  that, Alan -- he saw.

      Richmond.    Big.

                                 RICHMOND
                   He saw nothing -- a drunk woman
                   who liked rough sex too much. And
                   he's a burglar. Who's going to

      Luther holds it. It's the middle of the night. Luther
      turns the weapon over and over in his big hands...


153   EXT. WHITE HOUSE REAR GATE - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)            153   *

      Burton is alone in his car, exiting the gate and driving           *
      home. He turns onto the main road.


154   EXT. STREET NEAR WHITE HOUSE/INT. BURTON'S CAR - NIGHT       154

      He picks up speed.   Glances around -- no cars are
      following.

      Burton reaches into his pocket, takes out a MICRO-
      CASSETTE RECORDER, flicks it ON.

      A stove with one burner on high.   A tea kettle is over
      the flame.

      It is morning and Kate is clearly not fully awake. She
      is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and
      Sweet 'n Low; next she goes to the front door of her
      apartment, opens it, picks up the morning Washington
      Post.

      She unfolds the paper as she starts back to the
      kitchen --

      BACK TO SCENE

      Kate looks at it only a moment, shakes her head, then
      starts to turn her attention to another section of the
      paper --

      -- she doesn't get that far.

      Kate:   she has seen something she didn't catch before --

      The front page again.    And the headline is still there --

      -- but there is a smaller headline beneath it:

                               Jewel Thief Sought

      Kate sits down hard. Trying for control.      Entering a
      nightmare. She stares at the paper.

      The front page. Pictures of the mansion, of Walter
      smiling on his wedding day, of Christy.

      But Kate's eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline:

                               Jewel Thief Sought

      She tries to sip coffee, spills. She closes her eyes --
      in the kitchen, the pot of WATER starts to SHRIEK. Kate
      does not move.

      Another SHOT of Luther looking very different -- full
      beard. Again, a CLICK.

      Luther again -- elegant beard this time.      CLICK.

      Two people are present: Luther and VALERIE.      Valerie is
      very small, and doesn't miss much.

      She has been photographing him, and as the last photo
      slides out of the camera, she blows on it, puts it

      Seth and Laura in the good-sized criminal lab.    Loaded
      with up-to-date equipment.

      Seth has drawn a picture of the crime scene. Words like            *
      "Bedroom Door," "Exit Window," "Vault," "Bed," "Victim"
      are written neatly to scale. He holds a sheaf of papers.

      It's late afternoon and things are already getting
      crazed. NOISE in the b.g. throughout.

                                 SETH
                   See if any of this makes sense.

      Seth mimes opening the "bedroom door," stepping inside,
      closing it. He makes a click with his tongue.

                   I am Christy Sullivan and I walk
                   in and surprise a burglar.

      Seth moves to the "vault door," mimes closing that, makes
      a grunt.

                                 LAURA
                   Now you're the burglar coming out
                   of the vault and being surprised.

               That's nothing -- why do I bother
               to have her strip and then put her
               clothes back on?

                             LAURA
               There I can help you -- see,
               before you were a burglar you were
               a dry cleaner and you still love
               beautiful clothes.

                             SETH

                She had a point-21 blood alcohol
                level. -- she was too drunk to
                drive. I've checked every cab and
                limo company in the area and not
                one of them knows anything.
                Someone drove her home. Goddamit,
                who? And why haven't they come
                forward?

                              LAURA
                Maybe whoever drove her home
                killed her.

                   When I was 10 my father died -- he
                   was a miner and lung disease
                   killed him. I became rich at 25
                   and the first thing I did was
                   purchase that mine, close it, and
                   give every miner there fifty
                   thousand dollars to retire on.

      Seth.    The words pour out.

                               SETH
                 Been going nuts with this thing,
                 up all night and I remembered your
                 notion how it might be two
                 burglars, and around dawn I
                 thought, wait, what if it wasn't
                 two burglars but what if it was
                 one guy trying to throw us off by

                 only a half a dozen guys alive
                 could have pulled off the Sullivan

                               SETH
                 Because he hasn't been arrested in
                 thirty years.

                 jewel thief back then. Just a
                 kid, just part of a gang, a three-
                 time loser. But since he got out
                 the last time, he's only worked
                 alone --

               Seth -- breaking in isn't hard --
               what's hard is breaking in so no
               one knows you've been there. Now,
               after the architect, next you'd
               want the contractor's office --
               and the security company's office.
                      (beat)
               You know the skill involved
               breaking the security of a

                          (as Seth nods)
                   Well, I'm guessing there was
                   probably some secret way to open
                   it --

      And on those words --

      Luther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course
      nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing.

                                 SETH

                                 LUTHER
                   Seth, you've got to get with the
                   program you expect to catch this
                   guy -- most likely it is a guy, am
                   I right? Some kind of weird
                   loner?

                                 SETH
                   Maybe like you.

                   But you see any face often enough,
                   you'll start putting things
                   together. That's why these top
                   guys disguise themselves. I read
                   a great article a couple of years
                   back -- damn, I wish I could
                   remember where -- anyway, it was
                   about these makeup experts some of
                   them use -- wigmakers, people like
                   that.

                              LUTHER

169   INT. LUTHER'S SMALL HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                    169

      Luther is throwing clothes into a suitcase while talking
      on the phone --

                              LUTHER
                Not 'til morning?
                       (makes a face)
                -- I'll be by early --

      He hangs up, shuts the suitcase, takes off out the
      door --


170   INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  170

      A place we've seen briefly before.   Dark.   Moonlight
      through the windows.

      The sound of a KEY IN the DOOR.

      Luther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one
      largish room, books all over. The home of someone who
      doesn't care a whole lot about their home.


171   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                           171

      Luther enters. He opens the fridge. Disaster -- still
      water, sparkling water, carrot sticks.

                              LUTHER
                       (sadly, muttering)
                Katie darling, you've gotta try
                real food sometime.

      He closes the door, moves back into the room --


172   INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  172

      A graduation photo of Kate. Luther touches it with a
      fingertip, moves on through the silence.


173   INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                        173

      Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around --

      -- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law
      books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The
      mandatory lamp.

      And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture.
      The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman
      with a kind face.

      Half a dozen more shots as Kate grew up, the mother grew
      older. Mother and daughter, mother and daughter.
      Nothing unusual here at all.

      So why is Luther so sad?

      HOLD.

      10 A.M. A white-brick, weather-beaten building, Old
      Glory fighting the breeze.

      Richmond, speaking on a podium. The press corps stands
      in front of him, TV crews of all kinds, CNN the most
      noticeable.

      The same shot -- only now it's grainy -- we're watching
      it on a TV SCREEN. CNN ON the TUBE.

      A BARTENDER cleaning glasses; otherwise, not a whole lot
      going on.

      Now Luther enters, dressed for travel. He goes to a
      stool, orders a ginger ale, puts his passport and ticket
      on the bar, glances toward the TV.

                                 LUTHER

      Richmond at his press conference.   He speaks without
      notes and he speaks beautifully.

                              RICHMOND
                As you know, I came from an
                impoverished family in an
                impoverished town -- but we lived
                with our doors unlocked.

      Russell watching, listening; she loves hearing him talk.

                              RICHMOND (O.S.)
                We all lock our doors now, but
                that is not what concerns me...

      Burton and Collin, scanning the crowd.

                              RICHMOND (O.S.)
                ... we are also locking our
                hearts... that is the sadness,
                that is the loss.

      Richmond, and suddenly he's like a Southern minister.

                              RICHMOND
                We are locking our hearts to the
                cries of the weary, we are locking
                our hearts to the poor and their
                pain...

      An old man, standing behind Russell.     We realize it's
      Walter Sullivan.

                              RICHMOND (O.S.)
                ... Sisters and brothers, we are
                locking our hearts to ourselves.

      Walter Sullivan. Grainy now. CNN. He has aged
      shockingly in the past couple of days.

      Luther staring sympathetically at the devastated old man.

      -- Sullivan's image suddenly is gone --

      -- The Bartender has TURNED OFF the TELEVISION.

                   That is wrong. That is not
                   America. I shall fight that
                   battle.

      Luther, staring at the image of Walter Sullivan, who is
      heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed --

      -- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning
      for Walter Sullivan to join him.

      Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself
      -- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out
      wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward.

      Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving
      the stool, walking close to the television.

      Richmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces
      Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace.

                                 RICHMOND (V.O.)
                   Dear friend, old friend, we shall
                   fight that battle.

      Sullivan, too overcome by the moment, can only nod.

                                 RICHMOND (V.O.)
                   Who can explain the ways of
                   chance? If we had never met, I
                   would not be President. If
                   Christine had not taken ill, she
                   would be with you in Barbados                        *

                   I would give the world to lessen
                   your pain.

      The press corps.   Subdued, saddened.

      Richmond and Walter. They turn, face the cameras. The
      president's arm is still around the old man; they both
      blink back tears and now --

      -- here it comes ! --


179   INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE - EXTREME CLOSEUP - LUTHER - DAY          179

      The Bartender, surprised, turning toward Luther. He
      starts to say something, stops; something tells him to
      shut up and he does.

      A SHOT of the two of them, Luther and Richmond, one on
      CNN, one in reality, because Luther has moved so close to
      the TV he and Richmond could almost be staring at each
      other.

      the White House. On a guided tour.

      A bright late morning of what's going to be a beautiful
      day. A guide leads the people through a doorway. They
      troop happily along.

      Luther is with them; he seems happy too.


183   INT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO AREA - DAY                 183

      The guide leads the people through. They look around,
      chat with their friends, follow the guide out.

      Luther follows the guide out too.

      HOLD ON the room.

      All is as it was.

      Except a large envelope has been dropped on a side table.

      MOVE IN ON the envelope --

      -- it's addressed to Gloria Russell.


184   INT. WHITE HOUSE - GLORIA RUSSELL'S OFFICE - DAY            184

      Gloria Russell.    Terrified.

      Her doors are closed, Russell is at her desk. Burton
      stands alongside. Collin, silent, sits in a corner.

      And on her desk, half out of the envelope, is a photo-
      graph of the letter opener.

                                  RUSSELL
                   He was in the building -- he took
                   a guided tour.

      Burton pulls the picture all the way out, studies it.

                                 RUSSELL
                   I've never dealt with blackmail --

                                 BURTON
                          (trying for calm)
                   -- he doesn't want money --

                              RUSSELL
                       (exploding)
                -- you a mind reader too?                               *

                                 BURTON
                          (under control)
                   No, I just looked on the back --
                          (shows her )
                   -- see? --

      Luther has written something.

                                 RUSSELL
                          (reading)
                   'I don't want money.'

      Russell is more upset.    Burton almost smiles.

                                 LUTHER
                          (admiringly)
                   This guy sure has the guts of a
                   burglar. Wish we had him.

      Collin laughs.

                                 RUSSELL
                   You finished your recruiting
                   speech? Because I'd like to know
                   how I handle this.

                                 BURTON
                   Like you handled the letter
                   opener?

      Russell.     She studies Burton.   Then --

                                 RUSSELL
                   Gee, Bill, that could be construed
                   as criticism. Do you really want
                   me as an enemy?

      Burton stands there, massively powerful. His voice, when
      he speaks, is his usual voice: polite, considerate.

                                 BURTON
                   Miss Russell, I should have called
                   the police that night. But I was
                   weak. You convinced me to stay
                   silent. I regret that.
                          (another pause)
                   Know this: every time I see your
                   face I want to rip your throat
                   out.

      Russell.     Silence.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            72.

                                 RUSSELL
                   Fine -- you win the pissing
                   contest --
                          (then suddenly
                           almost like a
                           little girl)
                   -- what should I do?

                              BURTON
                Nothing -- because he's making a
                terrible mistake, he thinks he has
                time -- he doesn't -- Seth Frank's
                too good. He'll bring him in.

                                RUSSELL
                Then what?

                              COLLIN
                       (his first words)
                Then I kill him.

      Now, from them --


185   INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                    185

      She is, we will find, a top prosecutor for the Common-
      wealth of Virginia. Her office is a zoo.

      On her desk, a baby picture of Kate and her mom smiling
      -- but there is something a little different about it.

      Seth enters and they shake.    He glances around --

      -- sees the photograph, glances away.

      Kate has risen now -- and in the silence it's clear that
      even though they are both standing still, they are both
      circling.

                             SETH
                      (trying for a smile)
               For a tough prosecutor, you don't
               resemble your reputation, Miss
               Whitney.

                             KATE
                      (the same)

                           reply)
                   Look, Lieutenant -- I told you on
                   the phone, I'm simply not involved
                   with my father, so this may not be
                   a waste of time for you, but it
                   sure is for me.

                   What would you do if I just turned

                   kid, when he got out my mother and
                   I went off to live by ourselves.
                   We don't make contact. He doesn't
                   care about me. I've seen him all
                   of once this past year.

      Seth and Kate realize something: In a different world,
      under different circumstances, they'd probably be
      starting an affair.

      The mantle. A large blowup of the same picture Kate had
      in her office, the one of Kate and her mom --

      -- with one startling change: Luther is in this shot,
      standing there proud and smiling. She has ripped his

      Call it a montage, call it a collage, call it what you
      will, we are looking at dozens of photographs --

      -- all of them featuring Kate.

      Many of them we saw in her apartment -- only here, as in
      the photo over the mantle, Luther is there with Kate and
      her mom.

      We are looking at a shrine!

      And there are newer photos too -- Kate at her college
      graduation, Kate at her law school graduation, Kate and
      her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant, Kate
      alone on the steps of Middleton County Courthouse --

      -- these are not posed shots.

      She looks wonderful and alive in all of them --

      Kate. She looks dead now.     All energy gone.   She sits
      heavily down on the bed.

                               KATE
                       (fighting tears)
                ... but he wasn't at those
                places...

                         grown-up photos)
                ... college graduation; law school
                graduation; the night Mom and I
                celebrated when I got a job; and
                me alone on the steps? -- I'd just
                won my first case, I was so
                proud...
                       (still fighting)
                ... I used to think... sometimes
                I'd come home and I'd sense he'd
                been in my apartment, checking the
                fridge, shaking his head because
                he never thought I ate right...
                It's crazy but I just knew Daddy
                was watching over me...

      And now she loses it, starts crying silently.

      Seth kneels alongside her, gives her a handkerchief.

                You can do a good thing, Kate --
                       (beat)

                leave a message on his phone

      Collin.   He strokes the barrel of his high-powered rifle.

229   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                       229

      Empty.

      Now, from the workmens' angle, a woman moves to one of
      the tables. It's Kate. They don't pay much attention.

                                                             85.

      Kate. She hesitates, then decides on the front table.
      She takes a breath. Sits. Motionless.

                                                   CUT TO:

      McCarty as before, with his weapon. He pulls the trigger
      again and again, there is the "CLICK" -- now he flicks
      away a grain of dust from the barrel --

      -- then he puts the weapon down, reaches out and --

      ONE BULLET. It's supersonic ammo. McCarty picks it up,
      blows on it gently. He might be holding a child.


233   INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY                      233

      Burton and Seth.    They can see Kate sitting alone in the
      late afternoon.

                                 SETH
                          (mutters)
                Fuck...

      -- And a goddamn WAITER has appeared and is walking out
      toward Kate. He is Asian and very young.


234   EXT. CAFE ALONZO                                             234

      Kate, startled as the Waiter calls out from behind her.

                                 WAITER
                Miss?
                       (as she spins
                        around)
                What you want please?

      His English could be a lot better.

                              KATE
                Nothing, thank you.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                   KATE
                   Pardon?

                                 WAITER
                          (gesturing)
                   You sit you eat please.


235   INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY                        235

      Seth and Burton.       Stunned.

                                 SETH
                   This is not part of my brilliant
                   master plan.

      More Tums.

                                 BURTON
                   Unfuckingbelievable.

      They both crunch away.


236   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                          236

      McCarty, watching the Waiter and Kate. He's not happy
      either. He points a finger at the Waiter, goes "Boom."


237   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                         237

      Kate, and it's almost four o'clock and she's not at her
      best.

                                 KATE
                          (gesturing around)
                   I'm waiting for someone.

                              WAITER
                He must eat too, please.

                              KATE
                Oh he will, we both will -- we'll
                order half the menu -- but just
                not now --

      The Waiter nods, finally he turns, starts off.

      Kate.   Trembling.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

      The Waiter returning.

                                 WAITER
                   Cheesecake gone.

                                 KATE
                   Thank you so much.

      The Waiter nods again, and this time he does go.

      Kate, watching him, making sure.       Now she sits
      straight --


238   CLOSEUP - KATE                                                  238

      Very shaky, trying to hold it together. And now
      crosshairs cover her face as we PULL BACK to reveal --

      DAY

      Collin. He holds a very high-powered weapon. It looks
      like it could kill from a thousand yards away.

      Where he is -- and it's not a thousand yards away -- he's
      in an unmarked van on the street, even closer than
      McCarty.

      Collin, loading his weapon.       His movements are skilled.
      His concentration is total.


240   INT. BROWNSTONE -    DAY                                        240

      McCarty, glancing out at the office building area. The
      three workmen on the scaffolding are fighting to right
      the glass panel. One of them grabs a rope connected to a
      block and tackle.

      He pulls on the rope.      Slowly, the piece begins to rise.


241   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                          241

      Kate, sitting alone, studying her hands.


242   INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY                         242

      Seth and Burton.    The waiting is agony.

                                                              88.

      Kate.     It's worse for her.   She glances around --

      -- nothing, no one.


244   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                         244

      McCarty.    All the time in the world.


245   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                       245

      Collin.    Blows on his weapon slightly.


246   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                        246

      Kate, and it's a question of how much longer she can take
      it. Her trembling is almost out of control -- she
      glances around again and --

      -- and there he is!

      Luther Whitney himself, and he looks splendid in his new
      raincoat and hat --

      -- he moves along in the shadow of the office building,
      toward the cafe, walking with his usual grace -- Luther
      always seems to glide.


247   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                         247

      McCarty in the window.    Spotting Luther --

      -- totally controlled.


248   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                       248

      Collin does the same.


249   INT. LOBBY - DAY                                              249

      Seth and Burton, and the instant Luther is visible, Seth
      gestures toward the policemen: Get ready.


250   INT. BROWNSTONE - McCARTY - DAY                               250

      Collin, raising his.


252   EXT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - DAY                            252

      The three workmen, raising the glass panel.


253   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     253

      Kate.   Watching her father come closer.

      Luther. It's hard to suppress a smile as he walks
      towards his daughter.

      Kate, still watching.

      Luther, almost there.     Speaks softly.

                              LUTHER
                I did not kill that woman, Kate.


254   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                      254

      motion.

      Luther, seated now and as at last, he reaches out for his
      daughter's hand --


261   EXT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - DAY                            261

      -- The three workmen, and for a moment the glass panel
      slips and tilts and as it catches the afternoon sun --


262   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                      262

      but he FIRES.


263   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     263

      Luther and Kate as suddenly the umbrella at their table
      is severed and starts to topple.


264   INT. UNMARKED VAN - DAY                                    264

      Collin, startled, and he FIRES too.


265   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                     265

      Luther, instantly diving toward Kate as the second BULLET
      EXPLODES in the pavement close by.


266   INT. LOBBY - DAY                                           266

      Luther, taking Kate down to the sidewalk, protecting her
      body with his body and --

      Madness! -- because all goes nuts now as there are shouts
      and screams and people running this way, that way --

      -- The three workmen look down at it all -- then they
      look at each other in total confusion -- what the fuck is
      going on? --

      -- because what they see is that the recently-deserted

275   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                       275

      And Kate sits now, staring around, looking for Luther --
      -- and Seth in the middle of it all stares around,
      looking for Luther --

      -- because where the hell is he?

      A black police lieutenant, shouting for his men to spread

      Burton, turning, turning, trying to make sense of it all.

      Three police sergeants on MOTORCYCLES, GUNNING through
      the crowd.

      Kate, standing now, looking down -- and then she sees it
      -- on the ground where Luther was: a new raincoat and a
      new hat and --

      Seth, and it's all gone wrong and it's all going crazy
      and there is noise and there are shouts and there are
      whistles.

      The black police lieutenant, breaking into a run, chasing
      after someone we can't quite make out.

      A tall uniformed police lieutenant, entering Cafe

      -- he passes a couple of guys in chef's hats and the
      Chinese waiter who just gapes out toward what was his
      service area --

      -- the tall uniformed police lieutenant moves gracefully
      past --

      -- it's Luther.

      He goes to the front door of the place, glances back
      toward where the NOISE is still mounting -- shakes his
      head -- out the door and gone!

      The door to Kate's apartment opening and Seth coming in
      with Kate. Evening. Kate is as drained as you'd expect.

                         (glancing around)

                I like that in a woman.

      She doesn't smile.

      Seth, giving her back her keys and a piece of paper.    His
      voice is raw from all the shouting.

                                SETH
                  Listen, I'm sorry.

      Kate.   Nothing to say.

                  Anything unusual, call me right
                  away -- not a bother, I live
                  alone.

                                KATE
                  You said.

                         (he knows that)

      She nods.    They look at each other.    Then he starts toward         *
      the door.    Slowly.

                                KATE
                  Anything for the road?     I've got
                  water and water.

                                SETH

      Kate stares, then quickly glances at Seth. He just
      points to a bottle.

                                 SETH
                   Pelligrino would be great.

                You're not the first.

      As Kate turns, Luther, standing there, is looking at her.

                   murderer.

                                 KATE
                   No, this afternoon. To the
                   restaurant. Why'd you come then?
                   You must have suspected something,
                   or you wouldn't have been
                   prepared.

      He points to the couch -- as Kate sits.      Luther, and
      before she's even seated, he's into it.

                              LUTHER
                The robbery went fine 'til they
                came in. They were drunk. I hid
                in the vault. Sex got rough. He
                was going to kill Christy, but she
                turned the tables, was going to
                kill him. Two guys came in, shot
                her dead.

                              KATE
                The same two guys who tried for
                you this afternoon?

                              LUTHER
                Probably only one of them. I
                think Walter Sullivan might have
                hired the other.

                              KATE
                Pretty powerful enemy; good going.

                              LUTHER
                Not as powerful as the President
                of the United States.

      Kate just looks at him.

      Dead silence.

                Richmond was drunk. The two guys

                                 LUTHER

                   you know I'd kill myself before
                   I'd lie about that.

      Kate. Looking at him.        Because he wouldn't lie, not
      about that.

      Everything he's told her, all true.

      An elegant high-rise in Washington. Crisp, cool
      afternoon. A DOORMAN stands outside, enjoying the day.

      A well-dressed man rounds the corner; he holds a small,
      beautifully-wrapped package with a small envelope
      attached. He moves to the Doorman.

      The envelope being opened. It's early evening now.       The
      message inside is short and clear --

282   INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT                           282

      A beautiful necklace. Antique mostly likely. And
      tasteful -- we hear the sound of an ORCHESTRA PLAYING
      WALTZES.

      PULL BACK to reveal Gloria Russell, looking just
      splendid, the necklace around her throat, entering a
      large and very impressive White House dinner-dance.
      Clearly an important affair of state.

      We've never seen Russell quite      like this -- relaxed,
      secure in her femininity. She       nods distantly to Burton
      and Collin who are, as always,      close the President. For
      the first time now, we realize      something: Gloria Russell
      is hot for Alan Richmond.

      Richmond, on the edge of the dance floor, chatting with
      some elderly couples, several of them European, all of
      them wealthy.

                   Come again?

      This time she touches it -- he bends close to her.

                          (whispering)
                   You sent it to me this afternoon.

      Long pause -- then...

                   Well, of course.
                          (now, to the others)
                   Excuse me, all -- I am overcome
                   with the desire to dance with my
                   Chief of Staff.
                                                                             *
      A hand to her -- Russell, beaming, moves out onto the
      dance floor with him.

      Everyone at the gathering, watching them.

      Richmond and Russell, very much aware that all eyes are
      on them --

      -- what we don't know is this: they are both wonderful
      dancers. And they seem to be reveling in their moves --

      -- because throughout this, they never stop smiling.

                                 RICHMOND
                   What is this nonsense? I'm hoping
                   there's an explanation.

                   Your gift, Alan -- I was

                   wanted me to wear it tonight.

      The necklace.       He looks at it as they spin gracefully.

                   It is lovely, Gloria -- and you

      Russell, a quick glint of panic, a gentle peal of
      feminine laughter.

      Richmond and Russell -- he bends her back, their mouths
      are close.

      A kick in the teeth --

      -- he summons all his control, goes into even more
      complicated movements.

      The crowd of elegant men and women, it's really wonderful
      dancing they're seeing -- they start to applaud.

      Richmond and Russell, hearing the sound. Richmond
      acknowledges it with a smile as they come to climax.

      And as they bow...

      The crowd applauding louder, while on the dance floor,
      the President of the United States and the Chief of Staff
      applaud happily back. As the sound builds --


283   EXT. BURTON'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT                            283

      Luther in the night.    Silence.

      He is moving across the rooftop of a home. He carries a
      briefcase -- Luther's making business calls.

      Ahead is an attic window -- as he slides it open --

                                                              103.

284   INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT                        284

      Luther, slipping inside. Some stairs are just across.
      He goes down them, opens the door --


285   INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      285

      Luther stepping into the main part of the dark house. He
      stops. No noise at all except that of someone BREATHING
      DEEPLY, coming from an open bedroom door.

      Luther passes by -- for an instant we can see that Burton
      is asleep, an empty bottle by his head.


286   INT. COLLIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                286

      Luther rounding a corner --

      -- and we can tell immediately he's in a different house
      now. Burton's had only old furnishings, these are modern
      and new.

      Luther pauses, listening.     Nothing.

      He moves forward then, turns another corner --


287   INT. RUSSELL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           287

      -- and now we can tell he's someplace else -- this is an
      apartment with a large window looking out on the city.

      Luther doesn't stop to admire the view.    He moves
      silently on...

      HOLD ON the window.

      And suddenly:   Dawn -- the sun is starting to rise.

      PULL BACK to reveal --


288   INT. RUSSELL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN                  288

      Gloria Russell, as the ALARM GOES OFF.    She sits --

      -- she stretches --

      -- then she stares -- something has been taped to her
      lamp. We are looking at an issue of the Washington Post
      -- Russell's photo smiles out -- there is a headline that
      says simply: RUSSELL TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF.

      Written across her picture are the words: "This
      shitstorm is your fault -- if we go down, you go down!"
      Russell takes the paper down, stares at it. Furious.

                                                              104.

289   INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING                    289

      Burton, hung over, staggering into the kitchen of his
      home, stopping dead. A newspaper is set beside his
      coffee pot.

      A front page of the Washington Post. Years back. The
      lead article reports that a siege has been successfully
      broken --

      -- Burton, bloody and wounded, is being carried to an
      ambulance. A hero. Across the top these words have been
      written:

      HOW DID THIS HAPPEN, YOU GUTLESS FUCK?

      Burton stares.   Steaming.


290   INT. COLLIN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING                   290

      Collin, yawning, going into his bathroom --

      -- across his mirror is taped a large white piece of
      paper, across which is written in thick black marker --
      "If you could shoot for shit, we'd be out of this."

      Collin angrily rips it down.


291   EXT. DOWNTOWN NEWSSTAND - MORNING                          291

      A bunch of commuters and businessmen are buying papers.

      The newspapers. Washington, New York, Philadelphia --
      and they're all different front pages, of course, but one
      photo in all of them is the same --

      -- every one of them is running the mug shot of Luther.
      And the sense of the stories is the same too:

                          HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?

                                                    CUT TO:


292   COMMUTERS                                                  292

      crowded around, making their purchases. Some of them are
      young, some of them are half asleep. One of them is in
      his 60's and very wide awake --

      -- it's Luther --

      -- as he buys a paper, looks at the headline --
      fascinated.

                                                            105.

       Still early morning -- Collin is going through Burton's
       desk hurriedly --

       -- when Burton surprises him --

                               BURTON

                        (pissed)
                 -- I don't answer to you, asshole
                 --

       Russell in the doorway now, glaring at them.

                               RUSSELL
                 You're both assholes, now move --

       And on that --


293    INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY                                    293

       The note that was sent to Russell and the Polaroid of the
       letter opener.

       PULL BACK to reveal --

       The Polaroid and the note are on Richmond's desk. He
       studies them. Russell, Burton and Collin stand silently
       watching him, their hatred of each other clear.

       The smell of death's in the room.

      Kate Whitney, getting into the elevator.    Off to work.
      She pushes for the lobby.

      The doors close and the elevator starts down.

296   INSERT - ELEVATOR BUTTON                                      296

      The "L" is lit --

      -- but when the elevator gets there, it does not stop but
      goes straight on down to the basement.

      That's strange.     She instinctively moves to the rear of
      the car.

      ODD SOUNDS from the basement.     Kate's just the least bit
      tense.


298   INT. ELEVATOR IN BASEMENT - DAY                               298

      The ODD SOUNDS are LOUDER.

      And the doors don't open when they should.


299   INT. ELEVATOR - KATE - DAY                                    299

      Down the block is a police car. Two surveillance cops
      inside. Kate starts to drive -- and so do they.

      Kate turns a corner --

      -- and so do they --

      -- and as they do, they pass Luther, parked on the
      corner. Watching. Satisfied, he drives off in another
      direction.


302   EXT. OUTER CITY ROAD (WASHINGTON) - DAY                    302

      Luther, heading out of the city.    The sun is higher in
      the sky.


303   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                      303

      Several cars. Traffic is moving slowly.     Luther
      continues to drive.


304   EXT. KATE'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                            304

      Kate, coming out of her office building, hurrying along
      the sidewalk. Lunch hour.
                                                                         *
      She goes past some brownstones -- the two cops walk                *
      behind --

      -- the window of one of the brownstones is open, shadowy
      movement from inside --

      -- Kate hurries past, not paying attention... Cops don't
      either.


305   EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                        305

      Now a figure begins to appear in the window --

      The figure holds something long and thin, like a rifle
      barrel --

      -- it's a large woman with a long mop -- as she shakes
      it --

      Afternoon and the sun is strong.

                                                                      109.

306   EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                                 306

      Sunlight, streaming in an open bedroom window.          Whose
      bedroom, though?

      Two maids are cleaning it --

      -- and now we realize where we are: Walter Sullivan's
      bedroom, but it's all been changed, different rug,
      different fabrics, different furnishings.

      The maids work silently and well. A final sweep of a
      dust rag here, a last tug at the bedspread there.

      Done.   They go to the door, take a last look around.

      Perfect.

      They go.

      HOLD ON the empty room.

      Keep HOLDING.

      Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps
      out, clicker in hand.

      The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it
      back inside --

      -- the door starts to close --

      -- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he
      took the night of the robbery.

      And as he moves silently toward the door.


307   EXT. GAS STATION (WASHINGTON CITY LIMITS) - DAY                    307

      The outskirts of Washington.       Mid-afternoon now.

      Luther's at a pay phone.


308   INT. SETH'S OFFICE - DAY                                           308

      Seth, as he picks up the phone --

                                  LUTHER (V.O.)
                 Kate okay?

309    EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY                                      309

                               LUTHER
                 I'm not staying on long enough for
                 you to track this, just answer me.


310    INT. SETH'S OFFICE - DAY                                  310

                 She couldn't be in better hands --
                 talk about catching a break,
                 Secret Service called me. They're
                 taking over surveillance --


311    EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY                                      311

       The telephone swinging back and forth --

       -- and in the b.g., a car MOTOR ROARING away.


312    INT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY           312

       Kate, coming down the elevator again -- in her jogging
       clothes now. She has pushed the lobby button.

       The elevator stops suddenly on the second floor --

       -- The Super gets in, smiles.

                               SUPER
                 Got it working fine, Miss Whitney.

       Kate nods, smiles back --


312A   EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY                              312A

       Luther, driving like crazy through the city.


312B   EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                      312B

       Kate, getting into her car in front of her building,
       driving off -- no one is behind her.


312C   EXT. WASHINGTON - ANOTHER STREET - DAY                    312C

       Luther, HONKING his HORN as he barrels around a corner,
       scattering traffic.

       Kate drives into the park past a sign reading:                    *
       "PARKING LOT."                                                    *

       now.


312F   EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING LOT - ENTRANCE ROAD - DAY     312F

       Kate, following an arrow that leads to the parking lot.

       Luther, in the park, now, suddenly shouting "Shit" as
       we --


312G   EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING LOT - DAY                     312G

       A "DETOUR" sign.

       Kate, entering the parking lot.


312H   EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING LOT AREA - DAY                312H

       Luther, out of his car now, running like crazy through
       the park. Ahead is a sign saying: "JOGGING PATH."


313    EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY                    313

       Not many other cars so she gets a space in front,
       overlooking the river, and as she stops, takes out her
       keys --


314    BURTON AND COLLIN                                          314

       Collin at the wheel, ROARING in behind her, rear-ending
       her hard.

       -- there is a SCREECH of BRAKES and a SCREAM --


314A   EXT. JOGGING PARK - TRAIL - DAY                            314A

       Luther, running INTO VIEW, stopping dead, helpless now,
       staring at the worst thing in the world --

       Kate's car, careening against a rocky ledge, then cart
       wheeling the rest of the way down, landing horribly,
       spinning, finally coming to rest upside down and --

       pull front door open and reach inside --

       -- now there are cries as other joggers stop and stare
       and --

       Kate, as Luther pulls her body out of the wreckage.

                               LUTHER
                        (terrified)
                 ... Kate...?

       -- no response -- it's impossible to tell if she's
       alive --

       -- in the distance now, the sound of an AMBULANCE.


320    EXT. WASHINGTON HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - EVENING     320

       The AMBULANCE, SIREN SCREAMING.

       PULL BACK to reveal --

       Early evening now, getting dark, and the ambulance
       braking in front of the emergency room of a large city
       hospital --

       -- as doctors and attendants with gurneys come pouring
       out --

                                                               113.

321   INT. WASHINGTON HOSPITAL - KATE'S ROOM - NIGHT               321

      A private room. Later.      Kate is bandaged and attached to
      a bunch of equipment --

      -- but however faintly her breathing, it's still
      breathing and it's steady. She's alone for the moment in
      the semi-darkened room.


322   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                               322

      Empty.    A doctor comes walking along -- it's Collin.


323   INT. HOSPITAL - KATE'S ROOM - NIGHT                          323

      Kate in her room, sleeping.     Another doctor is with her
      now, checking her charts.


324   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                               324

      Collin. He sees what's going on, stops, pulls out a
      small notebook, pretends to read it, all the while
      glancing toward Kate's room with the one doctor still
      there --

      -- now from around the corner, NOISE, COMING CLOSER --
      SEVERAL PEOPLE APPROACHING, perhaps more.

      Collin turns away from the sound, curses, then stops --

      -- The doctor is done with Kate's charts.

      From around the corner now, the group coming closer
      still.

      Kate's doorway as the doctor exits and Collin enters --
      they pass each other --


325   INT. HOSPITAL - KATE'S ROOM - NIGHT                          325

      -- Collin moves a step further into the room --

      -- and now there is something in his hand --

      -- a hypodermic needle.

      Kate.    Out of it.   Lying there, eyes closed.

      Collin, the needle ready, moving silently toward the bed.

      Kate is barely breathing.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

325   CONTINUED:                                                    325

      And now suddenly Collin is barely breathing --

      -- because the other doctor's arms have viced around
      Collin's neck, forcing the air out of him.

      Collin, stunned, trying to struggle --

      The doctor jerking Collin's body into the air -- his feet
      are dangling now -- the hypodermic needle drops to the
      bed as the struggle goes on --

      -- and Collin's in fabulous shape. He's young and power-
      ful and he's been in terrible situations before and he
      knows how to fight and he's been taught to defend himself
      and --

      -- tough shit --

      -- the doctor -- it's Luther -- relentlessly increases
      the pressure against Collin's throat --

      -- Collin can't even gasp now --

      -- his feet can't kick anymore --

      -- his body starts to go limp --

      -- his eyes start to slide up into his head --

      -- silence in the room --

      -- it's almost over --

      -- which is when suddenly Luther lets go.

      Collin, eyes flickering open as Luther lays him down on
      the floor. All this next is whispered.

                                 LUTHER
                   Scream. Go on. Which do you want
                   most, for me to kill you or life
                   in jail forever?

      He has gone across the room to the bed.     Collin tries to
      move, can't.

      The hypodermic needle as Luther picks it up carefully,
      starts back to Collin.

                                 LUTHER
                   Going to guess this wasn't to pep
                   her up.

      Walter Sullivan, getting into his limousine in front of a
      Georgetown mansion. Later in the evening. The car
      starts to move. Walter looks frail and very old now.
      And somehow smaller.


330   EXT. GEORGETOWN/INT. LIMO - NIGHT                          330

      Walter huddled in the back seat, as the street lights
      illuminate him. He might even be ill. In any case, a
      sad figure.


331   EXT. GEORGETOWN - NIGHT                                      331

      The limousine, turning a corner.


332   INT. LIMO - NIGHT                                            332

      Walter.   Blinking.

                               WALTER SULLIVAN
                 Is this a shortcut, Tommy?                              *

                I'm your replacement driver for
                the evening, sir. Don't worry,
                Tommy's fine.                                            *

                                LUTHER
                Luther, sir.

                              WALTER SULLIVAN
                And are you familiar with how to
                get to my home, Luther?

                              LUTHER
                I know the way, sir -- I'm the man
                who robbed you --

      Sullivan says nothing; stares unsmiling.

                              LUTHER
                -- and you're the man who tried to
                have me killed --

                   -- I'm sorry I missed -- I believe
                   in the Old Testament, sir -- there
                   is nothing wrong with an eye for
                   an eye when a terrible deed has
                   been done.
                          (ice)
                   A deed such as yours.

                                 LUTHER
                   You want to believe that, don't
                   you? -- Makes your life a lot
                   simpler if you believe that, isn't
                   that right?

                   What do you think I gain being

      Sullivan.     Contempt.

                                 WALTER SULLIVAN
                   Have no idea -- you going to rob
                   me again? --

                                 LUTHER
                   I don't need your money, Mr.
                   Sullivan. Look in your vault
                   lately?

                                WALTER SULLIVAN
                         (he has)
                  I'm afraid we're a little late for
                  an attempt at leniency.

                                 LUTHER
                  Shit's coming down tonight, Mr.
                  Sullivan, do you want to be a
                  player or not?
                         (bigger)
                  Do you want to know what happened,

                   Do you want to hear how he beat
                   the shit out of her and tried to
                   strangle her -- you have enough
                   left for that? --

                   -- I could walk through fire --

      Luther, fast now.

                                 LUTHER
                   I was in the chair when they came
                   in.
                          (as Sullivan says
                           nothing)
                   They were drunk -- at first he
                   only wanted to bruise her -- she
                   fought back, he went for the kill
                   -- she turned the tables. Then he
                   screamed for help.

      Pause.

                   Who else was in my house?

                                 LUTHER
                   Secret Service shot her.

                          (doesn't like it)
                   Nonsense.

                                 LUTHER
                   -- don't you want to know who the

                                 LUTHER

                You fucking well do, don't shake

                It sure is.

      Walter Sullivan.    A long, shaky moment, then --

                   right. He heard it from her.
                   That night. And I heard every
                   word --

      Walter. For a moment, no reaction. Then he sits back
      hard. The air's out of him. He just breathes quietly.
      Then --

                                 WALTER SULLIVAN
                   That's not real proof.

                   And this?

      Sullivan takes it --

      -- it's the letter opener.

      Sullivan leans back, shuts his eyes.

                              WALTER SULLIVAN
                You could have stolen this.

      -- and he's very old and you expect tears --

      -- but he didn't get to be Walter Sullivan by crying --

      -- HOLD ON Walter --

      -- and this incredible shriek of rage explodes! --

      Then he gets out.


337   EXT. WHITE HOUSE GATE/EXT. LIMO - NIGHT                     337

      Luther has gotten out too. They stand close to each
      other. They nod. Then Walter starts away.

                               WALTER SULLIVAN

                 Is he working late? I haven't an
                 appointment but I'd like to see
                 him if I might.

                 You don't need an appointment, Mr.

      And as he waves him through --

      Luther, standing there, watching the old man.

      Walter, a final turn back, a nod of the head.

      Luther.   He nods back, returns to the car, gets in --

      -- and now we begin a BLIZZARD OF CUTS.

                    ... in the greatest shock to the
                    nation since the Kennedy
                    assassination, President Alan
                    Richmond's death has rocked...

       Luther has moved past now; we can't hear the radio
       anymore.


346A   INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT                            346A

       Luther enters. A number of people are present, all of
       them listening to a large radio, on the desk of the
       Information Clerk.

                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)                   *
                    ... Richmond died violently in the
                    Oval Office and Walter Sullivan...

       Luther has moved past now; we can't hear the radio
       anymore.


347    INT. KATE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                347

       She dozes.     Luther sits alongside in a chair.

       Outside, the moon is high in the sky.

       Kate blinks, half opens her eyes, sees Luther.

                                  KATE
                    ... you're still here...?

                                  LUTHER
                    Haven't budged.

       She dozes again.


347A   INT. HOSPITAL LOUNGE - NIGHT                                    347A

       A coffee machine in a lounge.       Empty.   But a TELEVISION
       SET IS PLAYING SOFTLY.

       Luther enters, gets some coffee.

       The TV is SHOWING the PRESS CONFERENCE Richmond held. As
       we WATCH, Walter Sullivan moves down toward the President
       and they embrace.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                 125.

347A   CONTINUED:                                                    347A

       Now the Press Conference is over and we are LIVE AT the
       FRONT OF the North Portico of the WHITE HOUSE. A ton of
       reporters --

       -- and Walter Sullivan, in their midst, beckoning for
       quiet.

                                  REPORTER #1 (V.O.)
                    Mister Sullivan, have you no idea
                    why the President took his own
                    life?

       Luther stops making coffee, looks at the screen.

                                  WALTER SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                           (voice soft)
                    I know he's been feeling the
                    pressure of office more than ever
                    lately. We've talked about it a
                    great deal.

                                  REPORTER #2 (V.O.)
                    But why would he stab himself?

                                WALTER SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                        (sadly)
                 That's a question that will haunt
                 me forever. Of course I tried to
                 stop him --
                        (beat)
                 -- Alan was like a son to me...

       Luther smiles, takes his coffee, leaves the room as we --

                                                       CUT TO:

       Kate sleeping. Seth stands there now. Luther enters
       with his coffee. Seth sees him and they both move to the
       door and confer silently --

       -- Seth indicates Kate.

       Luther crosses his fingers.

       Seth says something we can't make out.

       Luther nods.

       Seth glances a final time at Kate, then leaves them.

       Luther moves to Kate, studies her face.

                    He was just checking in. When

FADE IN:

EXT.  MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)

A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-
scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct.

The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then
pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles
and personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon.  Waiting.

The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it
moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a
second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes
glued to the distant object.

The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local TV van, finds the object again in the distance,
zooms in, and waits, like everyone else.

Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box
CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.

			CRAIS
	That was the scene in California's
	Mojave Desert three years ago today
	-- the historic first view of the
	Newcomer ship upon its dramatic
	arrival.  As with the assassination
	of John Kennedy, who among us does
	not remember exactly where he was
	that October nineteenth morning,
	when news first broke: that people
	have landed... from another star.

We PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...


INT.  A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar.

The off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly
ignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and
ALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores.

			FEDORCHUK
	I remember where I was -- pissing
	off my balcony at the neighbor's
	dog!

Others laugh.

			ALTEREZ
		   (yells at Crais on TV)
	Get to the goddamn ball scores!

ON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH
PROFESSOR comes up.  Her name and title appear across the
bottom of the screen.

			CAL-TECH PROFESSOR
	From the time mankind first gazed up
	at the stars there had been
	speculation about a visit by people
	from "out there."  How ironic that
	when that first contact was made,
	the two hundred and sixty thousand
	occupants aboard the craft were as
	surprised as we were about their
	arrival.  That they awakened from
	frozen hibernation to find their
	malfunctioning autopilot had landed
	them here by mistake.

The CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again.

			CRAIS
	These "Newcomers," we soon learned,
	were a genetically-engineered race,
	adapted for hard labor in almost any
	environmental condition.  In effect,
	their ship was a slave ship...
	washed ashore on Earth with no way
	to get back to where they came
	from...

A dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS
FRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the
countertop.

Now an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside
a supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN.

			FRESNO HOUSEWIFE
	When the Newcomers were first let
	out of the ship, they were
	quarantined in a camp not ten miles
	from the town here.  You can imagine
	how the people around here felt
	about that.  But once they were
	releases from the camp and we got a
	chance to know them, we saw what
	nice, quiet people they really are...

WIDER

revealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white
busboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two
trays from the counter.  The bartender is dwarfed by this
Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern.
Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy.

			FEDORCHUK
	Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?
	Workin' hard?

The Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but
disturbingly alien.

			FEDORCHUK
	You got your green card, buddy?  You
	didn't leave home without it?

The cops at the bar crack up.  Henry looks at Fedorchuk --
his eyes carrying no malice... or pain.  He merely blinks.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT

An explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY
very quickly.  We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.
sedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among
us now:

-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.

-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books.

-- A city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game.

			SYKES
	Jeez... they call that gang-bang a
	game...?

-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.

-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'
head... and alien hand.  Sykes jumps.  It's a NEWCOMER
DERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own
language.  In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk.  We know immediately what he wants.  Sykes rolls
down the window.

			SYKES
	Take a hike.

Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the
street.  Sykes grimaces at the smell.

			SYKES
	Why's it have to be sour milk that
	these guys get wasted on?  What the
	hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or
	Thunderbird for chrissakes?
		   (beat; disgusted)
	Slagtown.  Shit...

-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.

-- Alien hookers plying their trade.

			SYKES
	Hope their plumbing's the same.

			TUGGLE
	It is.
		   (and Sykes gives him
		    a look)

-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.

-- An alien couple exit a theater playing "Terminator
III".

-- An alien wig shop.

ANGLE

TITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile
and HEAR:

			TUGGLE (O.S.)
	So you gonna go, or you not gonna
	go?


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

The dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two
coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the
windshield.  A hand picks up one of the coffees and we
FOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen
some wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.
Beside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.
Tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.

			SYKES
	How can I go?

			TUGGLE
	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and
	your clip-on tie, have your landlady
	tie your shoes for you, and show up
	at the church.  Simple.
		   (beat)
	Me and Carol are going.

			SYKES
	What?

			TUGGLE
	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin
	since... since she was conceived in
	that cabin up in Big Bear.
	Remember?  You and Edie banged the
	wall so hard, me and Carol were
	picking plaster out of our hair for
	a week...

			SYKES
	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see
	Kristin get married, okay?  But--

			TUGGLE
	But you're bummed because your ex
	and her new husband are paying for
	the whole thing.

			SYKES
	Shit, if Kristin had to get married
	where I could afford it, we'd be
	holding the reception at Buddy's
	Burgers.

Sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off
mood.  Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop
radar.

			SYKES
	Uh-oh... Check it out.

THROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS
in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-
and-pop mini-mart on the corner.  One of them wears dark
glasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a
black vinyl raincoat.

			SYKES
	Does that look at all suspicious to
	you?

			TUGGLE
	Whatever gave you that idea?


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb
among other parked cars.


INT.  SEDAN - NIGHT

Sykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches
for the radio in the glovebox.

			TUGGLE
	This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a
	possible two-eleven in progress at
	Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court
	and Alvarado.  Requesting backup.

Impulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing
out.

			SYKES
	Let's do it, partner.

Tuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio
Dispatcher confirms the call.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the
store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the
counter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it
right at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door.

Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.

			SYKES
	You got your vest?

			TUGGLE
	Of course.  Right in the trunk of
	the car.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.

Through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,
yelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.
The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands
in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The
Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.

Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance.

			TUGGLE
	Watch the driver.  I'm going for a
	better angle on the door.

			SYKES
	I got him.  Don't get pinned.

Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-
corner across the intersection.

Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag
of cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but
he doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's
chest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,
slides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and
FIRES another round into the Proprietor.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	Aw, shit.

Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots.

The human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a
few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots
Tuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They
spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --
BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.

A civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit
by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the
intersection, steam rising from the radiator.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Tuggle dives behind a lamp post.

The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine
pistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire
at the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets.

A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between
Sykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is
standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He
rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.

Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.

			SYKES
	Get outta there!

			TUGGLE
	I can't!  Do you mind!

			SYKES
	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!

Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car, firing toward the store as he goes.

Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.

Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover.
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver
who is still inside the car.

			OLD MAN
	Can I get out now?

			TUGGLE
	Move it!

Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store.  As he considers his next move--

Tuggle fires at the two aliens.  They return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks.
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the
car.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the
fender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.
Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.

Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car.  He has nowhere left to go and--

-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street.

Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away.

Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his
shotgun CLICKS empty.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit
of the store.  The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.
The two of them run out the back.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.  One glance is
enough.  Nobody ever looked deader.

			SYKES
	Aw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!

He stares, shocked and incredulous.  He can't find a way
to think or feel about this.  Then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes, the rage revving.  He takes off
toward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching
in background.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken
glass, bangs through the exit.


EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off,
quickly cranking up to full speed.


EXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He
slows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots
of shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE,
looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge
billboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives.
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the
crates.

Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings
down off the fire escape, runs off.

Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.


EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up
ahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.


INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT

The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves
through the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so
he can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing
along the asphalt.

Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid
footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from
which direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges
for him with an alien CRY.

It's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just
in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat
alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the
blasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an
inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes
with outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and
FIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down
and stays down.

Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS
it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes
looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly
above!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold
onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the
gun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming
the gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet,
but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.

A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.

Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he
draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND
again.

SYKES' P.O.V.

Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look
at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The
strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.

ANGLE

The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching
SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings
onto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and
leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.

ON SYKES

dazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS
approaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.

SYKES' P.O.V.

An OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.

ANGLE

Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his
weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien
face.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,
sprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a
human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.

			HUMAN COP
	Whoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.
		   (to alien on the
		    ground)
	You okay?

Sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at
the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet
away.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.

			JETSON
	I am all right.

He gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.

			HUMAN COP
	I better call in.

He moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat
alien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might
retaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him
to kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on
the underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing.
Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He
struggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help
him up.

			JETSON
	Your hand will require attention.

Sykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.

			SYKES
	Get the hell away from me!  I don't
	need your goddamn help.

He almost loses his balance and has to steady himself
against the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture
of impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him,
with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit
when trying to understand human nature.


EXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

OPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over
his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the
Coroner's wagon.

WIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The
Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD
black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of
them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some
alien).  He moves into:


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

The CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs
out of the wall, photographing everything.  Several
UNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around
the room like a stranger at a party.

The Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange
rigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from
her lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get
her away from the body, but can't get her to budge.

MINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the
Raincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking
veteran uniform cop is with him.

			NATUZZI
	Looks like a standard combat pump-
	action.

			MINKLER
	It is.

			NATUZZI
	So what punched holes clear through
	that car out there?

Minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.
Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.

			MINKLER
	BRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are
	nasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away
	in flight leaving a fifty-caliber
	slug going two thousand feet per
	second.  Tug might as well've been
	hiding behind a rosebush.

Minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.
He looks.  It's Sykes.

			NATUZZI
	Pretty heavy artillery for knocking
	over a liquor store.

A new voice enters the conversation.

			JETSON (O.S.)
	An identical round was used in the
	shooting of a Newcomer named
	Hubley, two days ago.

Sykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to
see the voice is Jetson's.

			MINKLER
	Yeah?  So why the extra fire power?

			JETSON
	Perhaps because even the larger
	caliber handguns aren't always
	effective against my people.

			SYKES
		   (mulls this, then)
	You saying there's some connection
	to this other homicide?

Before Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to
the Proprietor's Wife steps up.

			FEMALE COP
	Hey, give me a hand with this woman,
	will ya Jetson?  We've got to get
	her to Division for her statement
	and she won't budge.

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes)
	Excuse me.

And he moves off with his partner.  Sykes calls after him,
but Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't
turn.

			SYKES
	So, you think there's a connection,
	or what?  Hey!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The slug-mobile pulls up.  A drained Sykes moves up the
walk to his front door.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place
decorated with negative taste.  It's obviously the maid's
decade off.

By rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering
machine on his way into the kitchen.  The tape rewinds.
He opens the fridge.  Not much here.  Left-over take-out
pizza carton.  Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.
Left-over take-out burger wrappers. 

The answering machine message begins -- he glances over
his shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.  During the
following, he reaches the fridge.  Brings out a milk
carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter.  Reaches
in again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly.  Then
searches for a semi-clean glass.

			KRISTIN'S VOICE
		   (bouncy, bride-to-be
		    happy)
	Hi, Daddy, it's me.  I'm over at
	Danny's parents' house... talking
	about Sunday.  I thought maybe you'd
	be home by now.  Anyway, uh, nothing
	really.  I just wanted to call and
	say I love you.  I love you, Daddy.
		   (she giggles)
	Uh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.
	Knowing you, you'll probably pull
	this tape out of your machine and
	save it -- in that drawer where you
	keep every card I ever gave you, and
	all of my old baby teeth... gross!
	Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape
	-- but I do love you, and I'll talk
	to you before Sunday.
		   (beat)
	Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met
	Danny last week.
		   (Sykes stiffens)
	Danny thought Tug was the greatest
	-- but, then, who doesn't?  Anyway,
	love you, talk to you soon.  'Bye.

The machine BEEPS and HISSES.  Sykes take the glass and
the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room,
switching off the answering machine as he goes.

Then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of
the machine and tosses it into a drawer.

				    FADE TO:

INT.  DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee.  He's slept about
four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with
Hagler.  He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk.

			SYKES
	So what've you got on Tuggle's
	killers?

			FEDORCHUK
	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than
	ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on
	it, okay?

			SYKES
	You don't have squat.

			FEDORCHUK
	You ever try to make a case in
	Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer
	informants is about as long as the
	list of Mexican war heroes...

			ALTEREZ
	Up yours.

			FEDORCHUK
	... Nobody talks to nobody down
	there.  Half of them don't speak
	English and the other half only when
	it suits them.  It's gonna take some
	time.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I know it's gonna take time.
	Like until the Ice Capades opens in
	Hell, with you two on it.

Across the room, the Captain's door BANGS open and CAPTAIN
WARNER pounds out, his deep voice booming through the
squad room.

			WARNER
	Nobody wanders off!  I got an
	announcement.  Get your asses back
	in here.

Two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into
the room.  Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner
stands holding a sheet of paper.

			WARNER
	I'll make this short.  This is a
	directive from Chief Evaner, who is
	acting on orders from the Mayor, who
	is under mandate from the Federal
	Bureau of Newcomer Relations.  As of
	nine o'clock this morning, one
	Newcomer uniform officer has been
	promoted to the rank of Detective,
	third grade.

The detectives GROAN... some angrier ones grumble, "This
is bullshit!", etc.

			WARNER
	And we've got him, gentleman.
		   (more groans)
	Volunteers for duty with the new
	detective should see me in my
	office... otherwise I will choose a
	volunteer myself.  That is all.

He turns and heads back to his office in the wake of
continued grumbling from the detectives.  Sykes, standing
to one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass-
walled office.  Waiting inside are a balding man and an
alien in a grey suit.  Sykes reacts.  The alien in the
suit is Jetson.

The grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers
something.

			FEDORCHUK
	Unbelievable bullshit.

			ALTEREZ
	How long has this Slag been on the
	force?  A year, max -- right?

			DETECTIVE
	I don't know about the rest of you,
	but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit
	still for this.  I'm calling the
	union, pronto.

Others grumble.  "Yeah!".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided
something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk
sees this.

			FEDORCHUK
	Where the hell is he going?


INT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sykes KNOCKS and enters.

			WARNER
	Yeah, Sykes?

			SYKES
	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for
	duty with the new detective.

Warner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes.

			WARNER
	... All right.  Detective Sergeant
	Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson.

			JETSON
	We have met.

Warner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes,
starting to smell something fishy.

The balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands.

			GOLDRUP
	Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office.
	Congratulations, gentlemen.

Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to.

			WARNER
		   (to Sykes)
	You are to have nothing to do with
	the investigation into Bill Tuggle's
	death.  You know that.  Leave that
	for Fedorchuk.

			SYKES
		   (nodding)
	Departmental policy.

			WARNER
		   (to Jetson)
	You?

			JETSON
	Yes, sir.

			WARNER
	Good.

			SYKES
	There's another case I'd like to
	take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer
	named Hubley.

Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something.
Sykes avoids his look.

			WARNER
	Granger and Pitts are already on it.

			SYKES
	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a
	caseload... and I would have thought
	with Jetson here being the first
	Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's
	body being found over in the
	Newcomer community...

			WARNER
	Don't tell me what to think.

			GOLDRUP
	He's got a point.  That's the sort
	of thing we should be doing with
	this early advancement program...

Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally
sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

The steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next
to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks
like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all
the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during:

			SYKES
	... and we work my hours.  I'll do
	the driving, you do the paperwork.
	You gotta learn it so you might as
	well do it all.

			JETSON
		   (after a moment)
	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you
	for what you're doing.

			SYKES
	What's that?
		   (then realizing)
	Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in
	your head.  We're not pals, we're
	not married, and we ain't gonna take
	long moonlight walks together...
	We're just partners.  And don't call
	me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or
	Matt if you have to.

			JETSON
	I am George.

Sykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half
steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up
cold.

			SYKES
	Wait a minute.  George?  George
	Jetson?

Jetson nods... he's used to this.
Sykes cracks up.

			SYKES
		   (between laughs)
	Man, somebody really hung one on
	you!  I've heard some good ones for
	you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley
	Davidson.  I guess the people at
	immigration got a little punchy
	after a while, coming up with names
	for a quarter of a million of you.
	You weren't at the back of the line,
	were you, George?

			JETSON
	My true name is Ss'tangya
	T'ssorentsa'.

			SYKES
	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I
	stick to George, do you?


EXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY

They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Anyway, what's it matter to you if
	we think it's funny, right?  Whatta
	you care?

			JETSON
	That is exactly so.
		   (completely deadpan)
	It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm
	sure it doesn't bother you at all
	that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss",
	two words in my language which mean
	"excrement" and "cranium".

Sykes looks at him, perplexed.

			JETSON
	"Shit... head".

Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing
there, the smirk dropping from his face.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY

They're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives.
Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.

			SYKES
	Let's talk Hubley.

			JETSON
		   (refers to a folder
		    he holds)
	His body was discovered three days
	ago, in an alley off of Central
	Avenue, near downtown.

			SYKES
	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the
	chest.

			JETSON
		   (gently correcting
		    him)
	Through the chest.  Rupturing both
	the primary and secondary hearts.

			SYKES
		   (out the window)
	Nice signal, dickwad!

Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes.
Then...

			JETSON
	He was employed at the Northwest
	Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He
	was manager of the Methane Facility.
	He was also a principle partner in a
	real estate venture to develop low-
	cost housing for Newcomers.

Sykes grimaces at the mention of "Newcomer housing".

			SYKES
	Terrific.  A real pillar of the
	community.
		   (beat)
	Was Hubley missing anything when
	they found him?  Was he ripped off?

			JETSON
		   (checks file)
	There was no wallet... but he was
	still wearing a watch and two rings.

			SYKES
	The guys at the mini-mart last night
	made a half-assed stab at the money
	in the till -- but I don't think
	that's what they were there for.  I
	think we got us a couple'a
	executions on our hands, George...

			JETSON
	The murder at the mini-mart is not
	our case.  The Captain said--

Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed.

			SYKES
	Look, you want to fit in here,
	right?  You want to learn how to get
	along?

			JETSON
	Yes.

			SYKES
	Well, there's a thing about
	partners, about being somebody's
	partner.  You do for each other.
	And other people's rules don't mean
	shit.  It's the rules set up between
	the two of you, that's all that
	counts.  Understand?
		   (Jetson nods)
	Okay.  Well, my friend and partner
	was shot last night and I'm after
	the shitbag that did it.  As my
	partner, I'm asking you to respect
	me and help me find him.

Jetson considers this several moments, then--

			JETSON
	And as my partner, I ask you to
	respect me and my desire not to
	break with procedure.

Sykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he
slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy
traffic, puts it in "Park." Jetson, who is already a
little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it.
HORNS instantly go crazy behind them.

			JETSON
	What is wrong?

			SYKES
		   (very calm)
	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get
	something straight.  You agree that
	there's a good chance these two
	shootings are somehow related,
	right?

YELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly
unsettled by the chaos.

			JETSON
	Well... yes, quite possibly.

			SYKES
	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be
	willing to accept the theory,
	George, that... possibly... by
	examining the evidence from one case
	we might shed some small ray of
	light on the other?  Does that sound
	unreasonable to you?

			JETSON
	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable.
	Although I--

			SYKES
	Great.
		   (a relieved sigh)
	Well, I'm sure glad that's settled,
	aren't you?

And with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly
out.

			SYKES
	I think we're really starting to
	click now, George -- hmmm?

Jetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

WINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading
Sykes and Jetson along the hall.  He reads on the fly from
a case file in his hand.

			WINTER
	You know I've been over all this
	with Fedorchuk and Alterez this
	morning...

			SYKES
	Come on.  You got nothin' better to
	do, cushy county job like yours.


INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

They enter briskly through a swinging door.  They move
among the tables (some occupied, some not) during:

			WINTER
	Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck.
	Anyway, according to the sheet, the
	guy you nailed outside by the car--

			SYKES
	The human?

			WINTER
	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder.
	White male, twenty-seven.  Let's
	see... wrap sheet shows one armed
	robbery conviction, a couple for
	sale of a controlled substance.
	Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke
	when you stopped his clock.

They have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter
unceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the
pale naked body of the Raincoat alien.

			JETSON
	Have you identified this one?

			WINTER
	So far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam
	Slag, if you like.

Jetson smiles slightly out of politeness.

			WINTER
	No I.D. on him and -- well, you
	know, no fingerprints -- so it could
	be tough.  Your buddies this morning
	went through the mug book but
	couldn't make a facial match.

			SYKES
	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with
	his hands in his back pockets.

Jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter
and Sykes continue talking off to one side.

			WINTER
		   (referring to
		    Raincoat alien)
	You took this gut out, too, didn't
	you?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			WINTER
	Lucky for you, you got him in both
	of his... well, what we loosely
	refer to as... hearts.

			SYKES
	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my
	damn gun into him.

			WINTER
	That's the way these people are.
	You don't hit both pumps you just
	piss them off.

During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over
-- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his
face.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully.
Then he peels back the alien's upper lip.

Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks
around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER.
Jetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him
using the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remain
oblivious.

			WINTER
	Oh, here's an extra headshot if you
	need one.
		   (hands Sykes a
		    polariod of dead
		    alien's face)
	We're just about to start cutting
	in.  You're welcome to stick around
	if you want.  It's really
	fascinating stuff.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I'll bet.

Sykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in
earnest conversation.  He only catches snatches of the
alien language.  Bentner appears very unsettled by what
Jetson is telling him.  In response to Jetson's final
statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something
Jetson has requested.  Sykes goes over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	What's this?  What's going on?

			JETSON
	Nothing.

			SYKES
		   (really suspicious
		    now)
	Nothing?

			JETSON
		   (looking away)
	Shouldn't we examine their personal
	effects?

Jetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PROPERTY ROOM - COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

Two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents
onto a formica counter.  Sykes looks through the dead
alien's effects while Jetson goes through the human's.
ORTIZ, the college girl working the property counter, sits
nearby doing homework.

Jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown.

			JETSON
	What is this?

			SYKES
		   (looks, then)
	A rubber.  A condom.  You know...
	Coney Island whitefish?
		   (Jetson doesn't know
		    what one is)
	Men, human men, put them on their,
	uh -- penises -- to protect against
	having babies.
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it; Sykes turns
		    to Ortiz)
	You need this for anything?

			ORTIZ
	Nope, got my own.  Anything you guys
	don't use gets stuffed away in
	storage.

Sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles
it before Jetson.

			SYKES
	Get the picture?

			JETSON
		   (frowning)
	And that fits?

			SYKES
	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It
	stretches.

			JETSON
	And still it fits?

Sykes looks at Jetson's serious expression.  He tosses the
condom and packet back into the counter and continues
searching.  A beat, then he can't stop himself -- he
steals a glance at Jetson's crotch.

Still searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's
well-worn heavy work boots.  He grimaces... the sides and
soles are painted with a viscous black substance.  He very
tentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not
what he thought it might be.

			SYKES
	What is this stuff?

Sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe
it.  Jetson glances over.

			JETSON
	It is a resin.

Sykes looks at him... surprised that he knows.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Newcomers working near methane
	gasses at oil refineries must paint
	it on their boots to protect against
	sparks.

			SYKES
	How the hell do you know that?

			JETSON
	A large number of my people were
	hired by refineries because the
	methane fumes are not harmful to us.
	My spouse's brother is one.

			SYKES
	So the Slag they're cutting into
	upstairs worked at a refinery just
	like Hubley worked at a refinery.
		   (beat)
	I'd say that "possible" connection
	between the two cases just got a
	hell of a lot more possible.
		   (beat)
	Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk
	to the wife of the Slag store owner
	blown away last night.

			JETSON
	I believe I should interview the
	widow alone.

			SYKES
	Why the hell--?!
		   (realizes it's
		    because of his lack
		    of "bedside manner")
	Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  MINI-MART - LATE AFTERNOON

The shattered windows have been covered with plywood.
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the
Proprietor's Wife.  She studies a photo Jetson shows her,
nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language.

Through the loud and smoky refinery we see Sykes walking
with the newly promoted Methane Section manager, O'NEAL,
in tie and shirtsleeves.  The workmen around them are both
human and Newcomer.

			O'NEAL
		   (yelling over the
		    roar)
	Mr. Hubley was an all right guy --
	and a damn good manager.  The men
	liked him.  I'm really gonna have to
	scramble to fill his shoes.

			SYKES
	Well, one of the men didn't like him
	so much...

They stop and Sykes hands O'Neal the polariod photo of
Raincoat alien.  They have stopped near the heavy
refrigeration-type door leading to the "METHANE SECTION".

Newcomer workers move in and out through the door during:

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo)
	You think this is the guy who did
	it?

			SYKES
	We think he could'a been involved,
	yeah.  You know him?

			O'NEAL
	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I
	hate to admit it but -- they all
	still kinda look alike to me.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Who else can I ask around here?

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo
		    again)
	Wait.  You know who it looks like?
	Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James
	Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He
	took the afternoon off.

			SYKES
	I think you're gonna find he's taken
	the rest of his life off.

O'Neal reacts.  Sykes notices the door to the Methane
Section.

			SYKES
	That where Anderson worked?

			O'NEAL
	Yes it is.
		   (some alien workers
		    come through the
		    door)
	Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas
	in there.  I don't know how these
	fellas do it.

Sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the
door.  O'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of
suspicion.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - SYKES AND O'NEAL

We see Sykes hand O'Neal a card, then move off.  O'Neal
watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts
up this way.
We PAN with him as he enters a door here on the second
level.

INT.  METHANE SECTION CONTROL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

O'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial.
Beyond is a glass wall overlooking the Methane Section.

ANGLE - BELOW

CAMERA TRACKS through the Methane Section... past the
alien workers in lab whites... past all the arcane
equipment and chemical procedures... ending in an EXTREME
CLOSE UP of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills
slowly with a pale blue, viscous liquid.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK

We're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes
pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately
maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown.  Jetson's
WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn
with a garden hose.  Jetson's son, age six, rides his
bicycle along the walkway.  Jetson, dressed in his suit
for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son.

Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes.

			SYKES
	Jesus.  Welcome back Ozzie and
	Harriet...

He HONKS the horn.  Jetson looks up, then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye.  Moves to his son, kisses him
on the top of his head.

Sykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his
derisive expression softens.  As corny as this tableau may
be, there's something very appealing about the innocence
of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.

Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we--

				    CUT TO:

INT.  RESTROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

CLOSE on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug
dispensers from a tuxedo pocket.  As the hand brings the
dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the
exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before.
It makes that distinctive CLINKING NOISE.  We PAN with the
hand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and
sunglasses now.  He wears a black tuxedo.  He lets a small
dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his
tongue.  He swallows... and reacts as the rush from the
drug hits him.

The door to the men's room bangs open and a MIDDLE AGED
POLITICO enters, obviously drunk.

Kipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the
Politico to the exit...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel.

			JETSON
	Mrs. Porter is not taking her
	husband's death well.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Did you learn anything?

			JETSON
	A week ago two men came to see her
	husband.  After they left, he was
	very frightened.  She identified one
	of the men from a photo I showed
	her.  It was Hubley.

			SYKES
	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

			JETSON
	She didn't know him.  But she said
	her son might.

			SYKES
	Did you talk to him?

			JETSON
	He has not been home since that day.
	But she told me where to find him.

Sykes nods.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

The men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns.  Only
two of three Newcomers faces present.  Kipling threads his
way among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's
platform, addresses the assembly.

			MAYOR
	... Our guest speaker tonight has
	done so much in his community and
	for his community in such a short
	period of time.  And I must say, as
	the founder of the first Newcomer
	owned and operated corporation in
	Southern California, he certainly
	has come quite far in the last few
	years.  Granted, not as far as he
	came in the years before reaching
	Los Angeles.

There is laughter from the VIPs.  Kipling slides into a
seat at one of the front tables.  He leans over and
whispers something into the ear of the person seated to
his right.  We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is
whispering to yet.  Whoever it is, nods.

			MAYOR
		   (continuing)
	As Mayor of this city, it gives me
	great pleasure to introduce someone
	who has so readily made our city
	his home... and all of us who live
	here, his friends.  Ladies and
	gentlemen, William Harcourt.

The VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front
table.  At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to
capture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right.
Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer
entrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes
that glint with his piercing intellect.  He rises, smiling
warmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his
right, to make his way to the podium.  He shields his eyes
somewhat from the bright spotlight.

Once behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast
pocket as the applause ebbs.

			HARCOURT
	Thank you all for that very warm
	reception.
		   (pauses, smiles)
	I'm particularly grateful because I
	actually had the gall to write that
	in my notes: "Thank you all for that
	very warm reception".  Imagine how
	embarrassed I would've been if it
	hadn't have been such a warm
	reception.

The VIPs laugh.  He's won them over instantly with his
charm and candor.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT

Sykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on
Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and
Kipling.  We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight
two nights before... but because Kipling looks so
different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright.  Still,
during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure
what.

			SYKES
	William Harcourt?

			HARCOURT
	Yes...

			SYKES
	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is
	Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police
	Department.

			HARCOURT
		   (nodding greeting)
	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't
	aware there were any Newcomers at
	the rank of Detective yet.

			JETSON
	I am the first.

			HARCOURT
	Congratulations.  This is my
	administrative assistant, Rudyard
	Kipling.

			SYKES
		   (throw away)
	Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?
		   (to Harcourt)
	Listen, we just need a minute of
	your time...

			JETSON
	We'd like to ask you about a
	business associate of your, Warren
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	Yes, I heard about poor Warren.
	Tragic.

			SYKES
	You were partners with him on some
	Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate
	thing.

			HARCOURT
	That's right.  He and I, along with
	seven or eight others.  Listen,
	gentlemen, I will be happy to assist
	you in any way I can --
	unfortunately, at the moment, I'm
	overdue at another function.

Suddenly there's a voice from O.S.:

			MAYOR (O.S.)
	William...

Harcourt turns as the Mayor and his WIFE step up.

			HARCOURT
	Mr. Mayor...

			MAYOR
	William, I was wondering if you
	wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and
	me.  Two limousines trying to make
	it across town in all this traffic,
	we're bound to be later than we
	already are.

			HARCOURT
	Excellent idea.  Ray, I wonder if
	you know two of your police
	officers... Detective Jetson and
	Sykes.

			MAYOR
		   (shaking their hands,
		    dismissively)
	A pleasure.
		   (to Harcourt)
	We really should be going.

The wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of
the Mayor with a very impatient expression.  Harcourt
smiles.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	Please feel free to call my office
	Monday morning for an appointment.
		   (to Jetson)
	Congratulations again on your
	promotion, Detective.  Remember...
	you're out there setting an example
	in our community.  I'll be keeping
	an eye on you.

Harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are
penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning.
Harcourt and entourage move off... leaving Sykes steaming.

EXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT

Walking behind the others.  They speak in very low voices;
Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs
during:

			KIPLING
	That cop, the human, he was the one
	who killed Anderson and the driver.

			HARCOURT
	This is becoming a serious breach of
	security.

			KIPLING
	He didn't recognize me.

			HARCOURT
	It is his new partner that I'm
	worried about.

INT.  POLICE FIRING RANGE - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

MAFFET, the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands
Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets.
Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing
line.

			SYKES
	Go on ahead.  I'll be right in.
		   (to Maffet, low)
	What'd you dig up for me?

Maffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag
containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore.  By
his manner this deal is definitely not kosher.  Sykes
hefts the weapon.

			MAFFET
	You said you wanted the biggest
	thing I could find... Well, this is
	it.

			SYKES
	What is it?

			MAFFET
	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking
	twice the impact energy of .44
	Magnum hot loads.

			SYKES
		   (flips open cylinder)
	Only holds five.

			MAFFET
	Yeah, the shells are too big for six
	in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you
	don't need but one.

			SYKES
		   (sighting)
	No... two.


EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT

Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking
careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up.  Jetson slips
the protectors down.

			SYKES
	Well, let's see what you got,
	Cochise.  Gimme six, rapid fire.

Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance,
turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target.  It's a
large, sloppy grouping.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	How long you been shooting?  That's
	pitiful.  Whattya gonna do if
	somebody draws down on you, wave
	your scores on the written exam at
	'em?

Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the
Casull.

			JETSON
	Why did you do it?

			SYKES
	Why'd I do what?

			JETSON
	Agree to work with me?  You don't
	like me... you don't like any of us.
	You have nothing but contempt for
	us.  And yet you become an outcast
	from your club of detectives by
	making me your partner...

			SYKES
	My partner is dead!  Because one of
	you bastards killed him -- then
	disappeared into a rathole down in
	Slagtown, where he's home and dry,
	'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody
	says nothing...

Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto
the hanging target form.  He hits the switch, running the
target down to the end of the lane.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	But he didn't figure on you, George.
	You're going to get me through that
	wall of silence.  You're going to
	make them talk to me.  You're going
	to help me find that Slag son-of-a-
	bitch.  Comprendo?  And if Fedorchuk
	and the boys in the bullpen don't
	like it, screw them... and if the
	Captain doesn't like it, screw
	him... and if all the Slags down in
	Slagtown don't like it... well screw
	them too!

Sykes raises the Casull, fires.  KA-BOOM!!!  The shell
rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target
form.  The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up.  KA-
BOOM!!!  again, and another hole is drilled through the
vest.  Other shooters look over.  Sykes sets the gun
down... sees his hand is bleeding.  Jetson absorbs all
this, as we--

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

A violet neon "X" FILLS FRAME, flashing hypnotically.
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele.
Several ALIEN MEN, brute laborer-types, lounge around out
front.  They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson
climb out of their car.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Okay, just stay back and do what I
	do.  Watch and learn, watch and
	learn...


INT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson walk into the almost total blackness of
this all-Newcomer place.

A few near-infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness.

			SYKES
	I can't see dick in here.

We can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables,
and the bar.  There are maybe twenty figures seated or
standing in the darkness.  The room falls silent in a wave
as Sykes' presence becomes noticed.

Sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his
unhurried movements.

			SYKES
		   (calling into the
		    dark silence)
	Which one'a you Slags is Porter?

			VOICE
		   (from the back of
		    the bar)
	Who wants to know?

Sykes squints into the darkness, then--

			SYKES
		   (aside to Jetson)
	Who said that?

			JETSON
		   (tilts his head to
		    indicate)
	At the end of the bar.

Sykes nods, starts in that direction.

			SYKES
	My name is Sykes.  I'm--

			ALIEN VOICE
	Ss'ai k'ss?

The whole place roars with LAUGHTER.  Too late Sykes
remembers what his name sounds like to them.  He continues
down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his
leg out and trips Sykes with his size 16 work boot.  Sykes
stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender.  Hoots
and derisive LAUGHTER.  He sees only shadows.

			OFFENDER
		   (merely a voice in
		    the dark)
	Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt
	yourself.

More laughter.  Sykes gives the darkness where the
offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his
way to the end of the bar.  Jetson follows.  Sykes stops
behind a big Newcomer in greasy work clothes.

ANGLE

The punk Newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head
down, trying to be inconspicuous.

He glances over at the two cops... his expression shifting
to recognition as he spots Jetson.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes speaks to the Big Newcomer's back.

			SYKES
	You Porter?

The Big Newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk.
Doesn't turn.  Sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns
him around.  The alien grabs Sykes' hand off, rising to
his full height.  He and Sykes lock eyes.  Meanwhile.  the
punk Newcomer (PORTER) has started to slip away unnoticed.
Jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him
by the jacket.

			JETSON
	No, Matthew.  I believe this is the
	one you want.

He pulls Porter back into play.  Now Jetson sees Porter's
face... and he, too, reacts with recognition.

Sykes gives Jetson a sour look, releases the Big Newcomer,
and turns his malice on the punk Newcomer.

			SYKES
	Your name wouldn't happen to be
	Porter, would it?

			JETSON
	Uh, Matthew...

			SYKES
		   (over his shoulder
		    to Jetson)
	Back off, George.

			JETSON
	But I-- (know this man).

			SYKES
	I'll handle it.

Jetson backs off, letting him handle it.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	Jesus, are the questions too tough
	for you already?  Let's try again--
		   (slowly)
	Is your name Porter?

			PORTER
	Ss'kya'ta'.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What's that?

			JETSON
	Screw you.

			SYKES
		   (back to Porter)
	Screw me?  That can't be right.

			PORTER
	Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'.  Ss'trokya'
	ss'lato na'!

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes, low)
	You don't want to know.

			SYKES
	Tell me.

			JETSON
	Your mother mates out of season.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	That's very colorful.  But see --
	now I've got a problem.  I don't
	seem to be getting much cooperation
	from you, Porter.  So I guess we're
	gonna have to take this little
	session down to my office, ya
	know?

And instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on
the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around
him.  Jetson gets a blast of it, too.  The aliens are
momentarily blinded.

Sykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his
face, as he starts to handcuff him.  But Porter gets a
hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight.
Darkness falls... along with Sykes' expression of
satisfaction.

Porter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table.  The
crowd HOOTS and CHEERS.  Sykes finds his way to his feet.

			JETSON
	Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this).

			SYKES
	Stay back!  I'm okay.

He charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club.
The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity
and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin.
Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises
again -- smiling.

			PORTER
	Don't they teach you anything about
	us in cop school, little ss'loka'?

Porter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver
a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into FRAME, locking
with Porter's, blocking the punch.  It is Jetson.

			JETSON
	Enough.

			PORTER
		   (eyeing Jetson)
	Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.  You're a
	cop.
		   (with some contempt)
	It fits you.

Jetson says something to him in the alien language.
Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back
exit.  Sykes stumbles over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	You know that guy?

			JETSON
		   (nods)
	From quarantine, when my people
	first arrived here.  He and I were
	housed together.

			SYKES
	How could a straight-arrow like you
	ever pick a roommate like him?

			JETSON
	In the camps, we were lodged four to
	a room.  The selection process was
	entirely random.  We did not get to
	stay with our friends... or
	families...

And he moves toward the back exit.  Sykes watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Porter leans against an alley wall.  He speaks English
learned on the streets.

			JETSON
	You don't know what your father and
	these two men were arguing about?

			PORTER
	I told you -- I was in the back of
	the store.  I just heard voices,
	muffled like.

			SYKES
	One of the two men was Hubley,
	right?  What about the other one?
	Did you know him?

			PORTER
	Yeah... I seen him around.  High-
	roller dude named Strader.  Joshua
	Strader.  Runs a club on the west
	side.  Encounters.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I heard of it.

			PORTER
	That's all I know.  You want
	anything more, you ask somebody
	else.

He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the
bar.

			JETSON
	I am sorry about your father.

Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then
disappears through the door.  Sykes and Jetson start down
the alley.

			JETSON
	If I may make a suggestion... We
	have different weak spots than you
	do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve
	plexus under the arm, here, will
	produce the effect I think you were
	looking for.

			SYKES
	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien
Language.  The SERVERS are teen aged humans and aliens.

Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their
order.

			KID
		   (serving them)
	Six forty-two.

They both put money on the counter.  The kid goes to put
the order together.  Sykes looks at the alien characters
on the menu.

			SYKES
	I don't think I could ever learn to
	read that shit.
		   (beat)
	How long did it take you to learn
	English?

			JETSON
	Three months.
		   (off Sykes' look)
	We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is
	our strength... what we were bred
	for, to adapt to hostile
	environments.

The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Thank you.

They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of
the bags as they talk:

			SYKES
	My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer
	girl in his class.  She's six years
	old and in seventh grade already...

They climb into the car.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson doesn't respond... some things are better left
unaddressed.  Meanwhile, Sykes has unwrapped his food and
recoils in disgust.

			SYKES
	Oh, God.  I think I got yours
	here...

He holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal
fur still on them.  Jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the
dripping cheeseburger he's just unwrapped.  They quickly
trade.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Which one is that?  Raw what?

			JETSON
		   (eating a strip)
	This is mole.  It's good.

			SYKES
	I'll bet.
		   (winces, watching him
		    chew)
	Would it really put you out if they
	tossed that on the grill for a
	minute or two?

			JETSON
	Our bodies do not assimilate the
	nutrients if the food has been
	cooked.

Jetson looks over at him, smiling.

			SYKES
	Oh, that's real attractive.  You got
	fur in your teeth, George.  Come on,
	man, we're gonna be talking to
	people... jeez.

Sykes looks at his burger, his appetite gone, shoves it
back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat.


INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Sykes pulls onto the street.

			SYKES
	So what was that other word for
	Human... Slow ka?

			JETSON
	Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small
	but intelligent creature".
		   (Sykes looks over,
		    doesn't know if he
		    likes this)
	It loses much in the translation.

			SYKES
	And what was that one about my
	mother?  That was a good one.

			JETSON
	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.

Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly.  After several tries, he can say it passably
well.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club.  The
antithesis of the "X" bar.  A human HOSTESS in a slit
dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a
table.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage.

REVERSE ANGLE

revealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the MUSIC.

Sykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and
Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a
human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.

			JETSON
	You are Cassandra?

			CASSANDRA
	That's right.

			JETSON
	We are with the Police Department.
	This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

			CASSANDRA
		   (laughing)
	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

			SYKES
	We're looking for your boss --
	Strader.

She eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage,
assuming they will follow.


INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

She moves along the narrow corridor.

			CASSANDRA
	He's not here.  Why ask me?

			JETSON
	The young woman at the front said
	you might know where he is.

			CASSANDRA
	She did, did she?  Well, she was
	wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.

			SYKES
	No problem.

She moves through a door.  Sykes follows closely so does
Jetson.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall.

			SYKES
	Look, we're not here doing an
	interview for the school paper.
	This is a homicide investigation...
	and if you don't stop jerkin' us
	around, I'm ready to start playin'
	hardball.

Jetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room.
Sykes rapidly motions to him to "go look around".  Jetson
mimes back, "Huh?"

			CASSANDRA
		   (slipping out of her
		    dance costume)
	Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds
	interesting.  Are you going to
	strike me?  You could tie me up and
	then do whatever you want with me...
	I've got my own ropes.

			SYKES
		   (still miming to
		    Jetson)
	Does that cost extra or you throw
	them in?

			CASSANDRA
	You've got me all wrong.  I don't
	charge money for something that I
	myself find pleasurable...

Finally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him.  He
says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:

			JETSON
	I am going out to the car.  I will
	meet you there.

Sykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor.
Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish,
low-cut dress.

			CASSANDRA
	Look, I don't know where Mr.
	Strader might be.  He comes and he
	goes.

			SYKES
		   (starting to feel a
		    little uncomfortable)
	The girl out front mentioned
	Strader's assistant, somebody named
	Watson.  Maybe he knows.

			CASSANDRA
		   (tensing slightly)
	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.

She is very close to Sykes now.  She fingers the lapel of
his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
		   (continuing)
	I know... Why don't you hang around
	for a while, let me entertain you?
	It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the
	truth, have you ever... made it...
	with one of us?

			SYKES
	Not unless I got real drunk and
	nobody told me about it later.

			CASSANDRA
	A virgin.  I find that very
	arousing...


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MUSIC drifts up from downstairs.  Jetson moves along the
corridor, scoping things out.  He tries a door.  Locked.
Tries another one.  Open.  He eases it wider, then enters
the darkened office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the office.  Looks around.  Makes his
way to the cluttered desk top.  Pushes things around...
all the usual stuff.  He starts to turn away, then his eye
catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger
books.  He reaches for it.  A small dispenser -- of the
kind we saw being filled at the refinery.  Jetson studies
it, his suspicions growing.  Opening it, he finds only the
barest trace of a viscous substance.

He smells it... not enough to tell for certain what it is.
But enough that he is very concerned about what it could
be.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now.
She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her
facial ridges.  She shudders with pleasure.  Sykes begins
to perspire.

			SYKES
	There's lots of things I haven't
	done, but his ain't high on the
	list.  Don't take it personally.

			CASSANDRA
	I think you're just a little scared
	now, about what you might find once
	the lights go out.  A little
	scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe
	more than you want to admit.  But
	doesn't that turn you on, that
	curiosity and fear, swirling
	together?
		   (coos)
	Think of it as broadening your
	horizons.

			SYKES
	I like my horizons narrow.

			CASSANDRA
		   (pressing herself
		    into him)
	Your voice is saying no, but your
	body is saying yes.

He quickly disengages from her.

			SYKES
	My voice, body, and everything else
	is saying I'll be back in two hours
	for Strader, and he better damn well
	be here.

He shoves a business card at her, then retreats through
the door.


INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes closes the door and lets out his breath.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she
quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom
button.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom
BUZZ in the next room.  Through the wall--

			WATSON (O.S.)
		   (tentatively)
	Yes...?

			CASSANDRA (O.S.)
		   (over the intercom,
		    breathless)
	Todd, it's me.  The police were just
	here... looking for Strader.  And
	asking about you.

Jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office,
drawing his gun.  The floor squeaks beneath his feet.  He
looks down, then continues toward the door.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson eases open the door.  It's the manager's private
office.  Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the
desk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray --
but no one behind the desk.  Jetson eases through the door
and--

-- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door!
Jetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Jetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed
office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes hears the fight through the private office door.
He throws the door open.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at
Jetson's assailant.

			SYKES
	Freeze!  Now!

The assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing
hard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is
TODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.

Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking
him sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson
seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into
some furniture and dives for the door.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape.
Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong
as he is, but he has the edge in experience.

Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway,
ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went.

			SYKES
		   (struggling with
		    Cassandra)
	Fire escape!  End of the hall!

Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to
get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff
around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at
him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and
charges down the corridor.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Jetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees
Watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area.

Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen
feet to the ground.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires
it up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls
his gun, aims.

The white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there,
gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split
second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to
avoid being hit.


INT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT

Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes
standing right in front of the car.  He hits the gas.
Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car.
Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass,
panics and--


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.

Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.

Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson
folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees.

			SYKES
		   (breathing hard)
	I'll be damned.  It worked.
		   (sees Jetson run up)
	How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo!
	Both barrels.  Dropped him like a
	bag of cement.

Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the
I.D.

			SYKES
	Who is he?

			JETSON
	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.

Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one
agonized breath.

			WATSON
	I don't believe this.  Look at my
	suit.  Look at what you made me do
	to my car.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Your girlfriend put up a better
	fight than you did, pal.

			JETSON
	We are looking for your employer,
	Joshua Strader.

			WATSON
	He's out of town.

			JETSON
	Why did you run?

			WATSON
	Because you two were chasing me.

			SYKES
	We were chasing you because you ran,
	you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

			JETSON
	When will Strader return?

			WATSON
	Who knows.  He's the boss -- he
	doesn't have to check in with me.

			SYKES
		   (wearily)
	Watson... this is my partner here's
	first coupla days, and he wants to
	make a good impression.  Me, though,
	the way I feel -- this could be my
	last day, know what I mean?  And I'm
	ready to rain on you like a cow
	pissin' on a flat rock.

			WATSON
	Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been
	around for a coupla days.  He didn't
	tell me where he was going or when
	he'd be back.  I swear it.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What do you think?

			JETSON
	I believe he is probably lying.

			SYKES
	Through his ass.
		   (to Watson)
	Next time you see him, tell him to
	call me... unless you want us to
	keep coming back on you like a bad
	case of herpes.

Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car.

ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON

as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	George, you can handle the women
	from now on, you mind?

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he
hears footsteps.  He turns with a "What now?" expression
and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He
goes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN
THUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's
employ.

			QUINT
		   (to other Thugs)
	Okay, scrape him up.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT

Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access
road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.
van.

Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back
of the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three
human Thugs.

They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing
the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.

			HARCOURT
	Any progress?

			QUINT
	My arm's gettin' tired and so far,
	zip.

			KIPLING
	He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to
	Strader.

			QUINT
	What's that mean?

			KIPLING
	Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to
	Strader is above pain or life.

			QUINT
	You tellin' me this guy would die
	before he'd screw his boss and work
	for us?  Nobody's that dumb.

			KIPLING
	It is something you couldn't
	comprehend, Quint.

Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.

			HARCOURT
	I understand you have been resisting
	my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of
	duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --
	no longer an issue, I'm afraid...

Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot
twice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes
widen in fear.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	I will not make this offer again.  I
	want you to work for me, to manage
	the nightclub as Strader's successor.
	If you do, you will know a wealth
	and comfort our people never dared
	imagine...

Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.

			WATSON
	Sss'k'a ta'!

Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring
his resolve.  Then--

			HARCOURT
	It is such a pity to die for an
	outmoded value.
		   (rising)
	Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for
	our friend's swimming lesson.

Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.

			HARCOURT
		   (to Watson)
	It's important to learn new skills.
	Essential to your growth as a
	person.

Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.  He bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf.  Quint
addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.

			QUINT
	You never seen this before, have
	you, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't
	gonna believe it... seawater is like
	battery acid to these guys... I
	don't know what it is, some kinds
	chemical reaction.  Whatta you think
	it is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him.
		   (a wave breaks
		    outside, the foam
		    rolls in)
	What I love about the surf is you
	can never tell how far up it's going
	to come until it... whoops, got a
	little wet there.

The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.  He
screams.  Flailing, one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water.  He howls and yanks out his hand.
We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand.  The Thugs get Watson swinging.

			QUINT
	Last call, sucker.  One... two...
	THREE!

Watson is flung into the surf.

ANGLE

Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline.  We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then
nothing.  Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.
Harcourt seems unperturbed.

			KIPLING
	When we picked him up, he was
	talking to those two cops -- the two
	who came to question you about
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	This is getting out of hand.  I want
	you to deal with it.  Immediately.

A wave rushes up the sand.  Kipling quickly steps back.
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	We must learn to embrace the things
	we fear... and from that grow
	strong.

A moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.
He motions to Strader's body and the surf.  The Thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the
kitchen wall phone.  Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle
of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a
glass, pours himself a shot.  As Jetson is talking, he
spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out
of the refrigerator two nights ago.

He sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement.
He finishes with his wife and hangs up.  He watches Sykes
take a long pull on the vodka.

			JETSON
		   (holds up milk
		    carton)
	Would you mind?

Sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass.  Jetson pours the semi-
lumpy milk and takes a big swallow.  Sykes grimaces.
Then--

			SYKES
		   (indicates phone)
	So, she keeps you on a pretty short
	leash, does she?

			JETSON
	My wife?  She worries about me.

Sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his
voice more weary then bitter.

			SYKES
	Yeah... I know the routine.

			JETSON
	You are married?

			SYKES
	Was.  Divorced.

			JETSON
	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a
	strange concept to us.

			SYKES
	It's like having an eleventh finger
	removed.  It hurts like hell, but
	you never really needed the damn
	thing in the first place.

Jetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand
this.  They drink... Jetson gazes around.

			JETSON
	Your home is quite disordered.  I
	thought perhaps you had been
	burglarized when I walked in.

			SYKES
		   (growling)
	I appreciate your honesty, George.

He smacks his glass against Jetson's.  They drink.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

Sykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared
photo.

			SYKES
	Ignore the bitch on the left, that's
	Edie.  I call her Edi Amin... This
	is Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda
	an old picture... she's twenty now.
	Getting married, in fact... on
	Sunday.

Jetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the
proffered photo.  They're both a little drunk now.

			JETSON
	Human children can be very
	beautiful.
		   (then)
	Getting married?  Congratulations.
	You will be taking Sunday off,
	then...

			SYKES
		   (uneasy)
	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not
	sure I'm gonna go.
		   (mumbles)
	She doesn't need her burn-out of a
	father there...

Jetson looks at him.  Sees something he never thought
possible in Sykes.  Vulnerability.  Trying to break the
melancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet.

			JETSON
		   (upbeat)
	I must show you...
		   (flips open wallet,
		    shows four crisp
		    photos of his wife)
	And this is Richard.  My son.  He's
	four years old.  We named him after
	the former President, Richard Nixon.

Sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table...
and has to laugh.  He looks up at Jetson's sincere face.
He may be starting to like this guy.

			SYKES
	You open to a piece of advice?  Tell
	people you named him after Richard
	Burton, the actor.  Just take my
	word for it.

And he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the
table, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

They are quite a bit drunker.  Jetson has doffed his
jacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes.

			SYKES
	... and so, and so the doctor says,
	"If this is the thermometer, then
	where'd I leave the pen?"
		   (laughs raucously,
		    Jetson doesn't
		    react)
	You're not... you don't think that's
	funny?  George, work with me, I
	always get a laugh with that one.
	Look, if the doctor's got the
	thermometer in his hand, then
	where's his pen gotta be?

			JETSON
		   (straight-faced)
	In the other man's rectum.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Sticking out of his ass... yeah!
	See, that's what makes it a joke.
	There's like a surprise, and your
	mind fills in the funny picture.
	Here's this guy with a pen stuck in
	his ass and he thinks it's a
	thermometer.
		   (Jetson just blinks)
	Nada, huh?

Jetson shrugs apologetically.  Sykes pours them each
another round.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Your health...

			JETSON
	Ta ss'trakyona'...

They CLACK glasses, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER STILL

The party has moves into the living room floor, around the
coffee table.  It's a quieter moment.

			JETSON
	There is so much our two peoples
	don't understand about each other.

			SYKES
	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from
	another goddamn planet, for
	chrissakes.

			JETSON
	You humans are very curious to us.
	You invite us to live among you, in
	an atmosphere of equality we've
	never known before.  You lay before
	us a beautiful green world, full of
	freedoms and opportunities... You
	give us ownership of our lives for
	the first time... and you ask no
	more of us than you do of
	yourselves: to live by the rules...
	rules that aren't made to keep one
	people subordinate to another, but
	rules that exist to preserve
	equality.  You aspire to very high
	ideals here.

Sykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized.  The guy's never
said this much at one time before.

If he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up
to a human like this.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	I hope you can understand how
	special your world is... how unique
	a people you humans are.  So it us
	all the more painful and confusing
	to us that so few of you seem
	capable of living up the the ideals
	you set for yourselves.

			SYKES
	Don't count on me, George.  I never
	had any ideals.

Jetson smiles a little.  He knows that's bullshit.

			JETSON
	We don't understand the hatred, the
	contempt.  But we must bear it... we
	must not react in anger... because
	our situation here is still fragile.
	The separationists would see us
	returned to the quarantine camps.
	The fundamentalists say we have no
	more human rights than dogs or cats.
	But the prejudice we face here is so
	insignificant compared to the pain
	that we've known before.  And that
	is why we are so grateful.

Sykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes.
Finally--

			SYKES
	Yeah, well... except I did hear you
	eat your dead.

Jetson looks at him a long beat, then--

			JETSON
		   (deadpan)
	Only on Fridays.

Sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then
explodes with laughter.

			SYKES
	You son-of-a-bitch.  You're okay.

Jetson stands unsteadily, and announces:

			JETSON
	I'm going home.

			SYKES
	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You
	do sleep, don't you?

Jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his
shoulder without turning around.  He's gone.

			SYKES
	What a wildman...

Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward
onto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN

The first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes
remains passed out on the sofa where we left him.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

The slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the
RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner.

The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-
mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint.

Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then
slides behind the wheel.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN

Quint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a
packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and
two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down,
starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears
from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the
seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back
seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He
sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy.

Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works.
Mistake.

Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees
this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his
brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the
face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his
face.  That was the last thing he needed.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car.
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck.

It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand.
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien
phrase, clearly the equivalent of "Fuck it...".

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY

Sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left
him.  Someone is POUNDING on the door.  He regains
consciousness reluctantly.

			SYKES
	This better be good news or money.

He shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting
Jetson.  Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief
with one hand and gives it to Sykes.

			JETSON
	Hold this.
		   (lurching to the
		    sink)
	I feel very terrible.

Sykes registers what he's holding.  He moves to Jetson,
who is running his head under the tap.

			SYKES
	Where'd you get this?!!

			JETSON
	A man, a human, was wiring it to
	your car.  I didn't get a good look
	at him.
		   (then, registering
		    that it's day;
		    panicked)
	I must call my wife...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

Jetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing
rumpled and a day old.  Sykes has showered and changed so
he's not suffering as much by comparison.  They approach
Sykes' desk.

			JETSON
	She's going to divorce me.

			SYKES
	George, she's not gonna divorce you.
	You mate for life, remember?

			JETSON
	She's very progressive.  I'm certain
	she's considering it.

ANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY

distributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes.

			SECRETARY
	You guys are looking for somebody
	named Strader, right?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			SECRETARY
	Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned
	in.  They found him.
		   (Sykes and Jetson
		    react)
	Or at least what's left of him,
	washed up on the beach at Zuma.

Sykes and Jetson react again.

			SECRETARY
		   (continuing; handing
		    over  the message
		    slip)
	They're still there if you wanna
	catch them.

She moves off.

			SYKES
	Well, let's roll, George.

			JETSON
		   (with a stricken
		    expression)
	To the... to the beach?

			SYKES
	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - ZUMA BEACH - DUSK

CRANE SHOT, nice and WIDE, showing the slug-mobile turning
off P.C.H. onto a gravel road which curves down the the
beach.  The following is V.O. as the car approaches the
water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Why?

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Please, I must get out here.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Come on, you won't have to get near
	the water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car!

We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

			SYKES
	All right, okay.  Keep your
	pantyhose on.  Jeez, when in doubt,
	freak out, for chrissake.

Sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen
of sweat, his hands shaking.  Sykes softens.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	It's all right, George.  It's cool.
	Just wait here, all right?  I'll be
	back in a coupla minutes.

			JETSON
	Thank you.

He climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach... toward
a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a
coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan.


EXT.  BEACH - DUSK

A quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a
person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk
suit.  Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and
other high tide detritus.

ANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ

looking down at the body.  A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing
a closer inspection.

			FEDORCHUK
	Found his wallet in his jacket
	pocket.  Joshua Strader, big as
	life.

			CORONER'S TECH
	Jesus, what a mess.  It's gonna be a
	bear to make a positive
	determination, but it looks to me
	like he was shot before being tossed
	in the drink.  At least twice--
		   (indicates where
		    hearts  would've
		    been on the body)
	-- here, and here.

Sykes absorbs this.  He rises along with Fedorchuk and
Alterez.

			SYKES
	How're you two doing on Tuggle's
	killer?

			ALTEREZ
	The store owner's son is in a street
	gang, so now we're thinking maybe
	it's gang related.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's real good.  You guys
	follow up on that for a coupla
	months.

Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above.

			FEDORCHUK
	Look at your dildo partner.  He's
	too scared to even come down to the
	sand.
		   (calls up to Jetson,
		    even though he's too
		    far away to hear)
	You're not gonna get wet standing
	here, moron!

			SYKES
	I'd like to see you next to a sea of
	hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see
	how much surfin' you'd do.

Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body.  Sykes grabs it as
it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car.
Fedorchuk flips him the bird.  As Sykes rounds the car, he
sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid
chalk marker a big star with "E.T. P.D." printed inside
it.  Sykes looks around.  Fedorchuk and the others stand
together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his
direction.

			SYKES
	Cute.


EXT.  BEACH ROAD - DUSK

Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up.

He's wiping the "E.T. P.D."  from the door as Jetson
approaches from the edge of the bluff.  Fedorchuk pulls up
alongside in his n.d. sedan.  He calls off to Jetson, who
is still twenty yards away.

			FEDORCHUK
	Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
	Forget you hip waders, big guy?

			SYKES
	Lay off, asshole.

			FEDORCHUK
	I may be an asshole, but at least
	I'm a real detective, not some outer
	shit space thing.

Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be
highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans
against it.

			SYKES
	Yeah?  you're a real honest-to-god
	detective...?

Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into
the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt
his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with).

He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing
Fedorchuk's car keys with the other.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Then detect these!

Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car
keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff.  Jetson, just
climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this
scene without knowing how it began.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

Sykes gets in, slams the door.  His hand hurts as he grabs
the wheel.  He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the
car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward P.C.H.
Jetson looks over, curious.

			JETSON
	What was that about?

			SYKES
		   (embarrassed that he
		    defended Jetson)
	Nothing.

On Jetson's confused expression, we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

A different burger stand.  Sykes and Jetson sit across
from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with
his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips.  This time
they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they
talk.

			SYKES
	... So we've got three guys dead.
	All Newcomers, all killed the same
	way -- execution style.

			JETSON
	Warren Hubley was in middle
	management at a refinery... Joshua
	Strader operated a successful bar
	and nightclub...

			SYKES
	... and Porter ran a piece of shit
	mom-and-pop mini-mart.
		   (beat)
	So what the hell's the connection?

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PATHOLOGY LAB OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office.  Winter
is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk.

			SYKES
	You guys finished the postmortem on
	Strader yet?

			WINTER
		   (his mouth full)
	You mean the Blob?  They're
	finishing up now.

			JETSON
	Is Bentner here?  I must speak with
	him.

			WINTER
	He went home early -- his kid was
	sick.

Jetson frowns.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Yeah, but he left something for you.

He wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an
envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson.  Jetson tears
open the sealed envelope.  The message inside is written
in the alien language.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Does this have something to do with
	the test he ran that he wouldn't
	tell me about?

CLOSE ON - JETSON

His expression grows stricken as he reads the message.

BACK TO SCENE

			SYKES
		   (getting very curious
		    and suspicious now)
	What kind of test?

			WINTER
	Looking for some foreign compound in
	the blood of that alien you dropped
	the other day.

			SYKES
	Did he find anything?

Winter shrugs, indicates the message Jetson reads, as if
to say, "Maybe it says in there".

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Well?

Jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket.

He is clearly disturbed by what he has read.  He looks at
Sykes a moment, then quickly breaks eye contact.

			JETSON
	It is nothing.

Jetson quickly moves off.  Sykes hurries off after him.


INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking Jetson.
They eventually reach the elevators and Jetson jabs the
button during:

			SYKES
	What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't
	nothing yesterday when you asked
	Bentner to run that test and he
	looked like he was about to shit
	peach pits, and it's not nothing
	now.  Don't lie to me, George,
	you're bad at it.

			JETSON
		   (distant, closed)
	You must leave me alone on this.

The elevator arrives, he steps in.  Sykes follows.


INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT

They enter the empty elevator.  Jetson presses the button
to descend.

			SYKES
	No, see, I don't leave you alone...
	I'm your partner.  I don't work that
	way... Tug didn't work that way.

Jetson remains steadfast.  Sykes, about to explode, slams
his palm against the red Emergency Stop button and the
elevator lurches to a halt between floors.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	No secrets, goddammit!  You don't
	hold back from me.  Whatever is
	going on, you're gonna tell me now!

			JETSON
		   (agonizing)
	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is
	not your concern.

			SYKES
	The hell it isn't, when somebody
	wires up enough C-4 explosive to my
	car to turn me into pink mist!
		   (beat)
	That Slag was on something, and not
	sour milk, either?  Am I right?
		   (he has backed Jetson
		    to the wall by sheer
		    force of will)
	TELL ME!  What is it?

			JETSON
		   (finally)
	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us
	it is a potent narcotic.

			SYKES
	How potent?

			JETSON
	Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The
	"high" lasts several hours.  We
	would receive small amounts of it...
	as a reward for our labor.

			SYKES
	We?  You've taken it?

			JETSON
	We all did.

			SYKES
	Where did he get it?  Was there any
	of it on the ship?

			JETSON
	No... I am sure not.  That is why I
	am so concerned... someone must now
	be producing it here.
		   (emphatically)
	But none of my people know how to
	make it.  The process was carefully
	guarded.

			SYKES
		   (as the enormity
		    sinks in)
	Jesus, this is major.
		   (then)
	Why didn't you tell me sooner?
	Why'd you hold out on me?

			JETSON
	Your people don't know about this
	part of out past.  And they can't
	know -- It would threaten our entire
	existence here.

The voltage runs out of Sykes.  He seems to understand
Jetson's dilemma.

			SYKES
	George... look me in the eye...
	George, you don't ever lie to me
	again.

			JETSON
	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot
	stop this without you.

Sykes stare at Jetson... absorbing the enormity of the
earth-shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile.  Sykes
reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching
hand.  He winces in pain... the son-of-a-bitch still
hurts.  He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger
door.

			SYKES
	George?  How about you drive...

Jetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote
of confidence.  They walk quickly around to the opposite
doors, climb in.


INT.  CORRIDOR - BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move down this government-building
corridor.

			SYKES
	There's gotta be some other
	connection.

They enter a door marked BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS.


INT.  BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

HIGH SHOT showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling
this huge room.  It's all but deserted.  Sykes and Jetson
are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) COMPUTER
OPERATOR, who they're shanghaied into helping them after
hours.

CLOSER - AT COMPUTER OPERATOR'S DESK

She sits at her computer terminal.  Sykes and Jetson stand
behind her as she types in commands and information.

She types: Hubley, Warren.  The computer screen flashes
past various information, then settles on a screen full of
information of HUBLEY, WARREN.

			OPERATOR
	Here's Hubley.
		   (scanning it)
	Left Quarantine on November
	thirtieth, relocated first to
	Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles
	early in February the following
	year.  Field of expertise: chemical
	manufacturing.  Looks like he passed
	up several other better paying jobs
	waiting for that one at the
	refinery.

			SYKES
	Try Joshua Strader, will ya,
	darlin'?

			OPERATOR
	For you, anything.

The Operator punches up STRADER, JOSHUA.  The screen fills
with information.

			OPERATOR
		   (continuing, reading
		    from screen)
	Released on November twenty-ninth.
	Came immediately to L.A.  Ten weeks
	after arriving he took over the
	abandoned club which is now
	Encounters.

			JETSON
		   (to Operator)
	Now the store owner, please.  Cecil
	Porter.

She types it in.

			OPERATOR
	Released December one.  He and his
	wife moved first to Modesto, then
	Coalinga, California -- wherever
	that is -- settled in L.A. in
	April.  Field of expertise:
	organic chemical engineering.  He
	and his wife have one child, a son.

			SYKES
	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful
	boy... close personal friend of
	George's here.

			OPERATOR
	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems
	to be matching up...

But Sykes wasn't listening.  He's starting off... an idea
forming.  He stands there a moment, considering it, his
face looking like he's chewing something sour.  It's so
off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it.
Then--

			SYKES
	Holy shit...
		   (to Jetson)
	Look what we're staring at: three
	Newcomers with nothing in common,
	right?  What if it's just one other
	guy who killed these three?
		   (Jetson looks at him
		    blankly)
	Three and one make four.  Four
	Newcomers... of totally different
	backgrounds...
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it)
	You and the store owner's son --
	that punker!

Suddenly the realization hits Jetson, too.  He looks at
Sykes.

			JETSON
	... Quarantine.

Sykes spins to the Operator, excited.

			SYKES
	Can you dig up their Quarantine
	records in this thing?

			OPERATOR
	Sure.  Just a minute.

She moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information. 

			OPERATOR
		   (to herself)
	Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.

She rapidly types in additional information.  The screen
shifts as she jumps files.  Finally she gets a line that
reads: ENTER LODGE NUMBER: She types: 7-7-2.

Sykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank... then
information flashes past as the computer searches... then,
finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: HUBLEY,
WARREN......... STRADER, JOSHUA.........

Sykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true.

On the computer screen: .........PORTER, CECIL.........

Sykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of
the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth
name.

On the computer screen: .........HARCOURT, WILLIAM.

CLOSE ON - SYKES AND JETSON

reacting to the name.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

CLOSE on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure
rises from the back seat.  We TILT UP to reveal William
Harcourt.

We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the
beach scene) parked in front of the limousine.  Kipling is
just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab.  Quint
exits the driver door.  Kipling slides open the van's side
panel, reaches in for--

-- a large black suitcase.  He slides it out.  Harcourt
nods.  He and Kipling start into the club, followed by
Quint.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage
move toward the back.


EXT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second
floor.  Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top
of the stairs waiting for them.  She's very uncomfortable
dealing with Harcourt.  Kipling and Quint continue on
toward the office door.  Harcourt pauses with Cassandra.
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers
linger against her flesh.

			HARCOURT
	Quite lovely...
		   (best)
	What is your name again?

			CASSANDRA
		   (flinching
		    involuntarily at
		    his touch)
	Cassandra.

			HARCOURT
		   (a chilling smile)
	I will have to remember that...

He continues down toward the office door.  Cassandra
watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - MOVING - NIGHT

			JETSON
	They had months in quarantine to
	develop the plan.  Porter, with his
	chemistry background, must have
	somehow come up with the formula for
	the drug.  Hubley manufactured it --
	at the refinery.  Strader, through
	the nightclub, established a
	distribution network.  And
	Harcourt--

			SYKES
	Harcourt was the brain who brought
	it all together.


EXT.  REFINERY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT


EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock
entrance.  Sykes and Jetson climb out.  They hop up onto
the loading platform and move purposefully into the well-
lit interior through the open door.


INT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

It is Saturday night, the plant is barely operational --
only a few WORKERS around.  Sykes and Jetson move
purposefully toward the back.

			SYKES
	Okay, George -- we gotta play this
	real smart.

			JETSON
	If the drug is here, we must destroy
	it.

			SYKES
	No, George -- you're missing the
	point.  The drug is evidence.  We
	need to have the evidence, ya know?

Jetson doesn't reply -- he's focused beyond what Sykes is
saying.  Sykes spots O'Neal up ahead by the refrigeration
door to the METHANE SECTION.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	That's the guy...

O'Neal recognizes Sykes and doesn't wait around for the
big Newcomer bearing down on him.  He dodges quickly
through the refrigeration door and swings it closed.
Jetson's hand hits the door an instant later, before it is
latched, and he pushes it open despite O'Neal's body
weight against the other side.


INT.  METHANE ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson grabs O'Neal by the collar and drags him deeper
into the deserted room.

			O'NEAL
	Hey, what are you, crazy?!  You
	can't come in here like this!  Hey!

Sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares.

			SYKES
	So much for playing it smart...

O'Neal's feet are barely touching the ground as Jetson
moves along the row of drug-manufacturing equipment.

Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long
finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the
drug.  It glistens blue on his finger.  It holds him
mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a
former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so.

			SYKES
		   (tentatively
		    stepping closer)
	Is that it...?

A beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of
equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from
his hand onto O'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins
the bug-eyed O'Neal to the wall.

			SYKES
	Uh, George...

			JETSON
		   (in O'Neal's face)
	Where is the drug?  Where have they
	taken it?

			O'NEAL
		   (choking)
	What drug?  This is an oil refinery,
	you...

			JETSON
		   (pushing harder)
	WHERE?!

			O'NEAL
		   (unable to breathe)
	You... can't do... this!

			SYKES
	George, uh... you're gonna break his
	little chest bones...

			JETSON
	Stay out of this, Matthew.
		   (to O'Neal)
	Tell me where the drug has been
	taken or I will crush your lungs
	against this wall.

O'Neal is experiencing real fear now.  Sykes has decided
to back Jetson up, for better or worse.  He takes the
"good cop" role.

			SYKES
	Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he
	gets like this, I can't control him.
	I've seen this before.  He got like
	this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's
	spine out and show it to him.
	Nothing I could do.  I hadda go
	throw up.

			O'NEAL
		   (at length, with
		    great effort)
	... They took the stuff out, all of
	it -- this afternoon.

			JETSON
	How much?

			O'NEAL
	About fifty kilos... of
	concentrate... and some street
	grade... in tubes.

Jetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure.
O'Neal is really in bad trouble now.  Even Sykes takes a
half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush
this man.

			JETSON
	Where have they taken it?

			O'NEAL
	Encount... Encounters Club.

Finally, Jetson eases off.  O'Neal slumps to the floor,
gasping for air.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

This time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set
and hard... as he strides to the car.  Sykes practically
has to run to keep up.

			SYKES
	George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's
	a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it
	-- we got him by the short hairs.
	He ain't gonna make any more of the
	shit.

			JETSON
	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to
	find it.  I can't let it get out on
	the street.

			SYKES
	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?

Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,
yanks it open.

			SYKES
		   (continuing; as
		    Jetson starts the
		    car
	You destroy that drug, you destroy
	the case.  Don't blow the whole
	thing now by not following
	procedure.

			JETSON
		   (through the open
		    driver's window)
	Fuck procedure.

And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels
out.

			SYKES
	Hey!!

Jetson accelerates toward the security gate.  The guard in
the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile
bashes through the barricade bar.

			SYKES
	GEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!!

Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no
car.  A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off
his shift starts ambling past.  Sykes runs in front of it,
waving his badge.  The pickup skids to a stop.

			SYKES
	Police.  Get out.  I need this
	thing.  Out, now!

The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into
gear.  The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have
much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other
traffic.  He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and
pops open the glovebox.  He shoves some maps and garbage
aside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see
what.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Cassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two
alien, one human) through the deserted club.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets
them enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her
lasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter
herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering
her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door.

It is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates
stacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra
powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth.
She struggles until she sees who it is.

			JETSON
	I am here to take Harcourt.  Where
	is he?

She hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a
nod toward the office door.

			CASSANDRA
	In there.

			JETSON
		   (pulling his gun)
	Show me.


INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

The large suitcase rests on the expansive conference
table.  A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens
it.  Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the
viscous blue drug.  Also several of the small, individual
dispensers.  It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in
a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is
flanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.
The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light
and dark.

The two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the
drug.  The human dealer doesn't know what it is.

			HARCOURT
		   (to alien dealers)
	It's been a long time, hasn't it,
	gentlemen?

			HUMAN DEALER
	What is it?

			HARCOURT
	A sweet indulgence from out past...
	resurrected for our future.

Harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien
Dealers' faces... smiles knowingly.  He slides one of the
dispensers from the suitcase.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing; to
		    alien  dealers)
	Please feel free to sample the
	quality.  The experience will be
	everything you remember it to be...

One of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to
his tongue.  The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt--

			ALIEN DEALER
	Where'd you get it?

			HARCOURT
	I arranged to spend some time with
	three very resourceful men.  With a
	certain amount of coaxing, one of
	them was able to reconstitute the
	formula for me.
		   (beat)
	They worked very well together.
	Unfortunately, they are no longer
	with us... but I was fortunate
	enough to reap the benefit of their
	endeavor.

He indicates the drug.  The first alien Dealer sways
gently, enjoying the sensation.  The second alien Dealer
takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over
him.  The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the
dispenser.

			HUMAN DEALER
	Let me try some.
		   (he does,
		    immediately spits
		    it out)
	Jesus!  Tastes like detergent!

			HARCOURT
	And that's all the effect it will
	have on you.  But when my fellow
	Newcomers learn they can obtain it
	here, they will work very hard... to
	make as much money as they can... to
	give it to me.

Suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to
the other office:

			VOICE
	You haven't told him all of it.

Harcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet,
caught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder
holster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer
office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then
steps out himself.  It is Jetson.

Quint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes
go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.

It is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring
to the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's
finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.

			QUINT
	He's got the C-4 charge!

Jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of
him.  He is sweating rivers.  The others quickly join him.
He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he
can see her.

			QUINT
		   (continuing)
	Just take it real casual, buddy.
	Keep your finger on that button and
	don't do nothing squirrely.

			HARCOURT
	If you release that button, you not
	only kill us, but yourself.

			JETSON
	To get you and that--
		   (indicates drug in
		    suitcase)
	-- I would do it.

He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that
Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.

			JETSON
	Everyone up against that wall.
	Very slowly.
		   (to Harcourt)
	Except you.

Harcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where
she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall.
Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.

Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses
it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.
All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.

			HARCOURT
	One small matter seems to have
	escaped your attention.  That--
		   (indicates suitcase)
	-- is not on any books as a
	controlled substance.  Legally it
	might as well be fifty kilos of...
	grape jelly.

			JETSON
	The charge is murder... and
	conspiracy to commit murder.
	Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably
	others.

There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue
eyes.

Cassandra stares at Harcourt.

			CASSANDRA
	You... you killed Strader?

Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
	Where's Todd?!  Did you do something
	to Todd?!

Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.

			HARCOURT
	Todd?  Who is Todd.
		   (then remembers;
		    smiles)
	Ah, poor Mr. Watson.

Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said
sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They
start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357
and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's
face.

			JETSON
	NOOO!

Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He
manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet
going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a
mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead
wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.
Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...
and nothing happens.

			KIPLING
	I got it!

Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the
floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her
with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously
hits her again.

Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling
rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm
-- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over
forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into
Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into
the wall face-first, pinning him there.

			HARCOURT
	Kill them both.

			KIPLING
	Here?

			HARCOURT
		   (raging)
	Do it!

Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the
base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.
There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks
up.

Quint is blown backward away from her.

Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the
Casull smoking in his hand.

Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid
wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He
crashes through it.

ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR

as the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint
cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.

ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE

Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at
Sykes.

Sykes dodges into the private office for cover.

The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.

Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door
leading into the adjoining outer office.

Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door,
straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.
Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,
covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down.

An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and
Kipling escaping, and takes off after them.

Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees
Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He
moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in
surrender, rise from behind the furniture.

			ALIEN DEALER
	Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --
	look!

Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.

			SYKES
	You okay?

			CASSANDRA
		   (dazed, but all
		    right)
	Yeah...

And he charges out the adjoining office door.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson
is ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire
escape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is
HEARD arriving O.S.


EXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT

Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.

Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the
fire escape, find themselves near the unit.

			HARCOURT
	Here!

He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps
in.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear
and floors it.

Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing
car.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the
rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.

			JETSON
	This way!

He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to
it, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls
out.

A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,
heading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.

INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE

Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
SIREN blast on.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic.

Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it
out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.

			JETSON
	Slow traffic on your right... you're
	clear at the left rear...
		   (Sykes changes lanes)
	Careful, red light ahead...

With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the
cross-traffic without incident.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily.

The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the
slug-mobile.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same
juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley.

			JETSON
	Yellow light ahead turning red...

But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it.

			JETSON
		   (continuing; wide-
		    eyed)
	Red light!  Red light!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the
intersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side
of the road, head-on into traffic.

Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police
unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between
them.

Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull
with the other.  He brings it up and around right in front
of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window
at Kipling.

At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.

Jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it.

			JETSON
	Green light, Matthew.
		   (Sykes doesn't
		    respond)
	Green light!

Now Sykes looks.  The light at the intersection has just
turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming.  It's a wall of headlights coming right for
the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Shit!

			JETSON
	Ss-ai!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes locks up the brakes.  Kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away.

Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of
action.  He skids a left onto a side street.


EXT.  SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on.  At the first street available, he cuts
back in behind the police unit.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the
police unit directly above them!  An on-ramp approaches
for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug-
mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a
few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,
cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--


EXT.  SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT

The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street
tunnel.  It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a
pile-up of traffic behind the police unit.

The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--

			SYKES
	Move your goddamned cars!

People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --
ignoring Sykes.  Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around.  He speeds off.


INT./ EXT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT

Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.  Harcourt smiles
with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile
behind them.  Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of
traffic.


EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT

Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian
traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at
Indianapolis.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead.

			JETSON
	There!

Sykes sees it.  Thinking fast, he eases off, using another
car as a blind.  He waits until the police unit is
parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right,
directly for the police unit.

Kipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile
broadsides the police unit.  Sykes forces the police unit
up the off-ramp.


EXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the
right.  The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes
stays right on its ass.  They charge up onto--


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80
MPH.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side
window, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing
past below.


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

A clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.  Sykes
pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the
police unit.  The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,
slowing him down.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Kipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,
then looks back out the front to see the end of the road
coming up fast!  Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on
the brakes.


EXT.  END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends.  An abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence.

With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at
Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The two cars are racing for a full head-on.  At the last
instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile
sideways, passenger side first.  The police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both
cars skidding madly to a stop.  A fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes sits stunned behind the wheel.  Disoriented but
conscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson
out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding.  Then he looks
over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's
hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-
mobile -- near the gas tank.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to
Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars.

He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window.
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase, then starts to run with it.

With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes
clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off
after Harcourt.

Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge.  He heaves the suitcase over, then
starts to climb.

Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit.  Kipling is
still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.  Sykes
is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions.
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge.

Sykes reaches the fence.  Instead of climbing, he simply
blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the
gate.


EXT.  ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT

The end of the bridge is in the "up" position... a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.  Harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.  His
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side.

Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a
prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.

Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --
and has nowhere to go.  He is backed into a corner, with
seawater on two side of him.  Harcourt pivots frantically,
sees Sykes coming this way.  Harcourt is a trapped animal.
His chest heaves in panic.  Then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of
resolve comes into his eye.

ON SYKES

He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
Harcourt is.  There's some movement among the shadows, and
Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against
the trigger.

Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.
A long moment then--

ANGLE - THE SHADOWS

Harcourt emerges from the darkness.  His face is composed,
the superior glint is back in his eye.  His arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in
surrender.

Sykes cat-steps forward slowly.  Harcourt stares at Sykes'
eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an
excuse.  Harcourt simply... smiles.

			SYKES
	Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're
	history...

			HARCOURT
	No, Sergeant -- not history...
		   (beat)
	Eternity...

And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of
the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm.  He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.  His
mouth fills.

He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes
mad, defiant.  And -- he swallows.  Long hold -- then the
wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse.  Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers
the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure.  His limbs hammer
against the deck... his back arches fiercely.  It is a
brutal, agonizing ten seconds.  Then, finally, his body
becomes still.

Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA

Sykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,
and hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand.

ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES

He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he
passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register
that the driver's door of the police unit is now open
before--

-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes
is thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground,
and the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
Kipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes
hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It
connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who
killed Bill Tuggle!

Kipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half-
second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN
ROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes
looks.

ANGLE

Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.

Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the
suitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires
again, and again, and again.

Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase
still over his head... until he is blasted at last and
forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the
inferno.

Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the
alien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire.

HIGH WIDE SHOT

of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two
cops...

				    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's
wagons, fire trucks.  We MOVE through it all to find Sykes
and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.

			JETSON
	With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I
	assume you will be requesting
	reassignment now.

			SYKES
		   (cool)
	It'd be for your own good.  I think
	you'd be better off with a partner
	who's a little more... by the book.
		   (smiles)
	... Still, I gotta tell you, George,
	for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on
	wheels once you get going.  I'd
	kinda hate to miss your next two
	days as a detective.

Jetson smiles.  He glances up as they are bathed in red
and blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them.
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.

			WILTEY
	I'll give you guys a lift to the
	station.  They're waiting to take
	your statements on the shootings.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Let's go, partner.
		   (then casually
		    correcting Wiltey
		    as he rises)
	And it's shooting.  Singular.

			WILTEY
	They said two.

			SYKES
	Nope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he
	o.d.'d.

SHOCK CUT - JETSON

We rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward
Sykes.  His expression tells us his blood has just turned
to ice.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT

ANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward
the DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front.

			DRIVER
	So it's just me and her left in the
	hot tub, right?

			ATTENDANT
	You and the blonde?

			DRIVER
	No, man, the redhead.  The blonde's
	gone in the house with some other
	guy.  But a few minutes later she
	comes back out, alone, when me and
	the redhead are going at it fast and
	furious in the tub, ya know... and
	she sees us, and... she climbs right
	in with us...

			ATTENDANT
	You're full of shit!

			DRIVER
	I swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm
	dyin'...

And, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN
F.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below
FRAME.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

Jetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back,
though he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward
toward the front.  Jetson is intently, nervously scanning
ahead and to both sides.

			JETSON
	You are certain this is the route
	they would have taken?

			WILTEY
	I'm not positive -- but probably.

			SYKES
		   (warily)
	What's this about, George?  I know
	that look.

			JETSON
		   (spots something out
		    a side window)
	There!  Go back.  Down that side
	street.

Wiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

as they approach an eerie scene.  The coroner's wagon is
stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,
headlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the
back doors wide open.  A patrol car is also here, on the
other side of the wagon.  There is no movement anywhere
near the two vehicles.

Wiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the
eerie scene.  He reaches for the radio hand mike.  Jetson
quickly covers it with a large hand.

			JETSON
	No!
		   (both Sykes and
		    Wiltey look at him)
	We must do this alone.

			SYKES
	Do what?!  George-- ?!

Jetson is already sliding out of the car.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns
drawn.  They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's
flashlight, shines it through the open back doors.  The
doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from
end to end.  The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.

Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,
Sykes and Wiltey follow.  Lights all ablaze, it too is
abandoned.  One door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots
something beyond the unit.

			WILTEY
	Oh, God...

Sykes and Jetson look.

The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as
well as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.  Their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead.  Wiltey
stumbles away, backward.

			WILTEY
	I'm calling for back up, now.

			JETSON
	Wiltey, no.

But Wiltey is going.  Jetson starts after him... but Sykes
grabs his arm, hard, and spins him.

			SYKES
	What is this?!

			JETSON
		   (low)
	... It's Harcourt.

			SYKES
	Harcourt is dead.

			JETSON
	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on
	the drug.
		   (searches for the
		    words)
	Massive amounts trigger a... a
	change.  Your body functions seize
	up, you appear to be dead, but it's
	really a state of incubation.  When
	you emerge you're...

			SYKES
		   (looks at the four
		    bodies sprawled
		    before him)
	Tell me about it...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

One minute later.  OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into
CAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted
spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car.  Wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street.  Sykes and Jetson, guns
ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes
everywhere.

MOVING POV

as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching
for any signs of movement.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk.  Their eyes everywhere.

			SYKES
	I never thought I'd say this, but --
	for once in my life I think I'm
	willing to wait for back-up.

			JETSON
	We can't let him get away.

			SYKES
	Why the hell are you so dead set
	against back-up?

			JETSON
		   (a difficult
		    admission)
	Because... because of what will
	happen if humans see what we are
	capable of becoming.

			SYKES
	But there's no more drug.

			JETSON
	You understand that.  But how many
	others will?

Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.

Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead.  Whatever it was,
was large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse
door.

			WILTEY
	There he is!

And Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to
stop him.

			JETSON
	Wiltey!

He and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left,
rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.
Sykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF
BRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

LOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's
stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear
around the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still
running -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling
fumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the
car.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the
car.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We
MOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid
is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE
UP farther, and--

-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting
on the hood of the patrol car.

Sykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body
lies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both
stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the
warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have
done this so fast?

THEIR POV

There are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell.
The sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and
DRIPS of this waterfront building.

ANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON

Jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun
from the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes
checks the Casull.

They exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they
split up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the
right.

WITH JETSON

As he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way
along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled
debris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to
HOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases
open slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the
door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all
the way.  There's nothing inside... now.

Jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is
Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the
warehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Sykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head
as he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.
He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table
and a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to
some local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a
steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite
out of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a
jacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched
on the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight.

Sykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.
He looks around, then continues on.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a
set of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the
stairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the
shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT

Sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging
from the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins
pushing through them.

SYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS

Because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack
of nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through
-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much
farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the
deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the
way he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets
and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--

-- a terrifying face!

ON SYKES

He stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the
Casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.
It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.
The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous
visage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start
his heart again.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Jetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a
door.  He eases it open, enters.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the shadowy confines.  He hears an
incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner.  He moves
to it.  Turns the spigot, stopping the drip.  Other drips
are HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around
him.  He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the
wall above the sink.  Suddenly he sees the movement of
something behind him.  He spins with the shotgun.  A huge
shadow moves along the wall.  He pivots the shotgun again
-- toward the source of the shadow.

It's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the
ceiling.  Jetson lets out a deep breath.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.
A strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.
It makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND.  Sykes
moves along the intersecting hallway.  The CLINKING SOUND
catches his attention.  He stops, listens, then starts
down the passageway, toward us.

He comes forward into the storage room, having to get very
close to the strand of something before he sees what it
is.  It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently
against itself.  Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,
silencing it.  He considers.  It could've been a natural
occurrence... or something could have brushed against it,
setting it in motion.  He tightens his grip on the Casull,
backing away from the chain.  He senses something behind
him and spins.  Nothing there.  He relaxes.  However--

Behind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the
other end of the short passageway.  It is a figure, moving
slowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the
hallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway
as it approaches Sykes.  It stops, inside the room now,
directly behind Sykes.  Close enough to reach out and
touch him.  It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more
powerful.

Suddenly, Sykes senses something is there.  He turns,
slowly, and--

SHOCK CUT - HARCOURT

as he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last
time Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge.  Only this
time it is a horribly transformed Harcourt.  His eyes are
red-rimmed and piggish.  His head is lumpen, his skin
thick and hard.  His neck muscles are corded -- giving him
a kind of hellish cobra's cowl.  There is still
intelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral
intelligence now.

			HARCOURT
		   (his voice a guttural
		    rumble)
	Looking for me, Sergeant?

Sykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the
Casull, and fires.  The powerful Casull round catches
Harcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.


EXT.  WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT

Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing
blast of the Casull.  He gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

Harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact.  The
cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-
burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.
Harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts
toward Sykes.

Scared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires.  One of his shots
misses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head.  The
remaining shots strike Harcourt full on.  Harcourt is
jerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in
anger -- but none of the hits stop him.  The Casull is
empty and Harcourt keeps coming.

Sykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.
Harcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard.  We
HEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates.  Sykes HOLLERS,
and the gun jumps out of his hand.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Jetson races in, shotgun ready.  The last of Sykes' shots
are still ECHOING.  Jetson looks around, frustrated,
unable to tell exactly where they are coming from.  He
sees the likely path and charges that way.


EXT.  DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

On the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,
having been thrown ruthlessly from above.  As Sykes' body
sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs.

Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet.  Harcourt lurches forward
and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him
down the docks.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at
the coroner's wagon.  The Officers leap out, flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost
collapses again.  Harcourt comes at him.  Then Sykes sees
it--

-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties.  Sykes makes a break for it.


EXT.  WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,
frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.  Then, in the
distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty
-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.  Jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the
stairs to help Sykes.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.  The fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty.  Harcourt is fast
behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck.  He yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,
relieved that he has escaped.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes
did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then
onto a second jetty.  And from here, he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the
stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from
above.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,
the sun-gun washing over the docks.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically
waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The
Pilot starts to take it down.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on
his leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws
dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls
away.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the
dock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open
door.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto
the dock.

			JETSON
	On that boat -- out there!

Jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth
of the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back
of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the
bow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey
trapped.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the
channel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the
boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,
looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt
at the stern dinghy.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back
at what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.

			CAPTAIN
	Hey!


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back
against the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the
engines REV loudly.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As
Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the
ratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides
backward into water!


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson watches this happen.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie
line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.

Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already
splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is
sinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward
him.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the
line.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--

-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat!

The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from
the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some
of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes
sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is
on him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy
below.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in
agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt
sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib
cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt
off balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the
first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the
dinghy.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water.  Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's
partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top
of Sykes, and drags him under.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting
to help, knowing he can't.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him.  Sykes shoves it
away, struggling to stay afloat.  His head keeps dunking
under.  He's drowning.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.

			JETSON
	Take it down!  Take it down!


EXT.  WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking
under again.  The helicopter's skids are three feet above
the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	ALL THE WAY!

			PILOT
	I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!

Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but
the skid is just too high.  Jetson has no alternative, and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done.  He moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid.  Hanging on, three feet
above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching
hand.

The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the
two hands meet!  Jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on Sykes' hand.  He starts pulling Sykes up.
When--

HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'
FACE.  His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone.  The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,
breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under
again.

Jetson is frantic.  He keeps waiting -- but this time
Sykes doesn't come up.  Jetson doesn't know what to do.
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot
from the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his
own arm below the surface!  He feels around, gets hold of
something, and pulls.  It is Sykes' wrist.  He pulls hard,
bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	Take it up!

The Pilot does.  Sykes comes up out of the water.  His
feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand
and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.
Sykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving
up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it
falls back into the water below.

Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his
limp arm.  Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,
wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.
The Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they
just pulled Sykes from.

			PILOT
	What the hell was that down there?
	It was weird.

Jetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say.  Sykes
looks at Jetson a long moment, then--

			SYKES
	Looked like every other damn slag to
	me.  Just plain ugly.

Despite the pain, Jetson smiles.

				 LONG DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY

We are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,
trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling.  A
PAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him.  One of
the alien arms is also in a sling.

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson.  Both men wear
tuxedos.

			SYKES
	How do I look?

			JETSON
	You look very good.

There's a knock at the door.  Sykes opens it.  There
stands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking
radiant in her wedding dress.  She is in a foyer, and
behind her is the interior of the church with all the
assembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson & son.

			KRISTIN
	Ready, Daddy...?

Sykes' heart melts.  Before moving to the door:

			SYKES
	George, uh... I want to apologize
	now, in advance, for all the rotten
	things I'll ever say or do to you
	over the years.

Sykes moves to join his daughter.  As he does:

			JETSON
	That is all right, Matthew.  After
	all, you are only human.

Sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	What a wildman...

Sykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start
down the aisle.

				    FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT.  MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)

A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-
scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct.

The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then
pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles
and personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon.  Waiting.

The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it
moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a
second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes
glued to the distant object.

The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local TV van, finds the object again in the distance,
zooms in, and waits, like everyone else.

Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box
CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.

			CRAIS
	That was the scene in California's
	Mojave Desert three years ago today
	-- the historic first view of the
	Newcomer ship upon its dramatic
	arrival.  As with the assassination
	of John Kennedy, who among us does
	not remember exactly where he was
	that October nineteenth morning,
	when news first broke: that people
	have landed... from another star.

We PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...


INT.  A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar.

The off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly
ignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and
ALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores.

			FEDORCHUK
	I remember where I was -- pissing
	off my balcony at the neighbor's
	dog!

Others laugh.

			ALTEREZ
		   (yells at Crais on TV)
	Get to the goddamn ball scores!

ON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH
PROFESSOR comes up.  Her name and title appear across the
bottom of the screen.

			CAL-TECH PROFESSOR
	From the time mankind first gazed up
	at the stars there had been
	speculation about a visit by people
	from "out there."  How ironic that
	when that first contact was made,
	the two hundred and sixty thousand
	occupants aboard the craft were as
	surprised as we were about their
	arrival.  That they awakened from
	frozen hibernation to find their
	malfunctioning autopilot had landed
	them here by mistake.

The CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again.

			CRAIS
	These "Newcomers," we soon learned,
	were a genetically-engineered race,
	adapted for hard labor in almost any
	environmental condition.  In effect,
	their ship was a slave ship...
	washed ashore on Earth with no way
	to get back to where they came
	from...

A dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS
FRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the
countertop.

Now an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside
a supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN.

			FRESNO HOUSEWIFE
	When the Newcomers were first let
	out of the ship, they were
	quarantined in a camp not ten miles
	from the town here.  You can imagine
	how the people around here felt
	about that.  But once they were
	releases from the camp and we got a
	chance to know them, we saw what
	nice, quiet people they really are...

WIDER

revealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white
busboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two
trays from the counter.  The bartender is dwarfed by this
Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern.
Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy.

			FEDORCHUK
	Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?
	Workin' hard?

The Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but
disturbingly alien.

			FEDORCHUK
	You got your green card, buddy?  You
	didn't leave home without it?

The cops at the bar crack up.  Henry looks at Fedorchuk --
his eyes carrying no malice... or pain.  He merely blinks.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT

An explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY
very quickly.  We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.
sedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among
us now:

-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.

-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books.

-- A city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game.

			SYKES
	Jeez... they call that gang-bang a
	game...?

-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.

-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'
head... and alien hand.  Sykes jumps.  It's a NEWCOMER
DERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own
language.  In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk.  We know immediately what he wants.  Sykes rolls
down the window.

			SYKES
	Take a hike.

Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the
street.  Sykes grimaces at the smell.

			SYKES
	Why's it have to be sour milk that
	these guys get wasted on?  What the
	hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or
	Thunderbird for chrissakes?
		   (beat; disgusted)
	Slagtown.  Shit...

-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.

-- Alien hookers plying their trade.

			SYKES
	Hope their plumbing's the same.

			TUGGLE
	It is.
		   (and Sykes gives him
		    a look)

-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.

-- An alien couple exit a theater playing "Terminator
III".

-- An alien wig shop.

ANGLE

TITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile
and HEAR:

			TUGGLE (O.S.)
	So you gonna go, or you not gonna
	go?


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

The dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two
coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the
windshield.  A hand picks up one of the coffees and we
FOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen
some wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.
Beside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.
Tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.

			SYKES
	How can I go?

			TUGGLE
	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and
	your clip-on tie, have your landlady
	tie your shoes for you, and show up
	at the church.  Simple.
		   (beat)
	Me and Carol are going.

			SYKES
	What?

			TUGGLE
	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin
	since... since she was conceived in
	that cabin up in Big Bear.
	Remember?  You and Edie banged the
	wall so hard, me and Carol were
	picking plaster out of our hair for
	a week...

			SYKES
	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see
	Kristin get married, okay?  But--

			TUGGLE
	But you're bummed because your ex
	and her new husband are paying for
	the whole thing.

			SYKES
	Shit, if Kristin had to get married
	where I could afford it, we'd be
	holding the reception at Buddy's
	Burgers.

Sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off
mood.  Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop
radar.

			SYKES
	Uh-oh... Check it out.

THROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS
in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-
and-pop mini-mart on the corner.  One of them wears dark
glasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a
black vinyl raincoat.

			SYKES
	Does that look at all suspicious to
	you?

			TUGGLE
	Whatever gave you that idea?


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb
among other parked cars.


INT.  SEDAN - NIGHT

Sykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches
for the radio in the glovebox.

			TUGGLE
	This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a
	possible two-eleven in progress at
	Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court
	and Alvarado.  Requesting backup.

Impulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing
out.

			SYKES
	Let's do it, partner.

Tuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio
Dispatcher confirms the call.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the
store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the
counter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it
right at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door.

Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.

			SYKES
	You got your vest?

			TUGGLE
	Of course.  Right in the trunk of
	the car.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.

Through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,
yelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.
The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands
in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The
Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.

Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance.

			TUGGLE
	Watch the driver.  I'm going for a
	better angle on the door.

			SYKES
	I got him.  Don't get pinned.

Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-
corner across the intersection.

Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag
of cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but
he doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's
chest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,
slides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and
FIRES another round into the Proprietor.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	Aw, shit.

Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots.

The human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a
few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots
Tuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They
spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --
BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.

A civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit
by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the
intersection, steam rising from the radiator.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Tuggle dives behind a lamp post.

The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine
pistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire
at the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets.

A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between
Sykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is
standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He
rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.

Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.

			SYKES
	Get outta there!

			TUGGLE
	I can't!  Do you mind!

			SYKES
	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!

Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car, firing toward the store as he goes.

Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.

Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover.
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver
who is still inside the car.

			OLD MAN
	Can I get out now?

			TUGGLE
	Move it!

Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store.  As he considers his next move--

Tuggle fires at the two aliens.  They return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks.
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the
car.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the
fender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.
Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.

Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car.  He has nowhere left to go and--

-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street.

Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away.

Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his
shotgun CLICKS empty.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit
of the store.  The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.
The two of them run out the back.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.  One glance is
enough.  Nobody ever looked deader.

			SYKES
	Aw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!

He stares, shocked and incredulous.  He can't find a way
to think or feel about this.  Then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes, the rage revving.  He takes off
toward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching
in background.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken
glass, bangs through the exit.


EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off,
quickly cranking up to full speed.


EXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He
slows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots
of shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE,
looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge
billboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives.
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the
crates.

Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings
down off the fire escape, runs off.

Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.


EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up
ahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.


INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT

The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves
through the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so
he can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing
along the asphalt.

Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid
footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from
which direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges
for him with an alien CRY.

It's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just
in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat
alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the
blasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an
inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes
with outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and
FIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down
and stays down.

Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS
it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes
looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly
above!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold
onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the
gun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming
the gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet,
but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.

A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.

Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he
draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND
again.

SYKES' P.O.V.

Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look
at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The
strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.

ANGLE

The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching
SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings
onto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and
leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.

ON SYKES

dazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS
approaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.

SYKES' P.O.V.

An OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.

ANGLE

Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his
weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien
face.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,
sprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a
human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.

			HUMAN COP
	Whoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.
		   (to alien on the
		    ground)
	You okay?

Sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at
the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet
away.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.

			JETSON
	I am all right.

He gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.

			HUMAN COP
	I better call in.

He moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat
alien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might
retaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him
to kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on
the underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing.
Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He
struggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help
him up.

			JETSON
	Your hand will require attention.

Sykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.

			SYKES
	Get the hell away from me!  I don't
	need your goddamn help.

He almost loses his balance and has to steady himself
against the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture
of impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him,
with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit
when trying to understand human nature.


EXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

OPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over
his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the
Coroner's wagon.

WIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The
Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD
black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of
them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some
alien).  He moves into:


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

The CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs
out of the wall, photographing everything.  Several
UNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around
the room like a stranger at a party.

The Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange
rigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from
her lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get
her away from the body, but can't get her to budge.

MINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the
Raincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking
veteran uniform cop is with him.

			NATUZZI
	Looks like a standard combat pump-
	action.

			MINKLER
	It is.

			NATUZZI
	So what punched holes clear through
	that car out there?

Minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.
Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.

			MINKLER
	BRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are
	nasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away
	in flight leaving a fifty-caliber
	slug going two thousand feet per
	second.  Tug might as well've been
	hiding behind a rosebush.

Minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.
He looks.  It's Sykes.

			NATUZZI
	Pretty heavy artillery for knocking
	over a liquor store.

A new voice enters the conversation.

			JETSON (O.S.)
	An identical round was used in the
	shooting of a Newcomer named
	Hubley, two days ago.

Sykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to
see the voice is Jetson's.

			MINKLER
	Yeah?  So why the extra fire power?

			JETSON
	Perhaps because even the larger
	caliber handguns aren't always
	effective against my people.

			SYKES
		   (mulls this, then)
	You saying there's some connection
	to this other homicide?

Before Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to
the Proprietor's Wife steps up.

			FEMALE COP
	Hey, give me a hand with this woman,
	will ya Jetson?  We've got to get
	her to Division for her statement
	and she won't budge.

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes)
	Excuse me.

And he moves off with his partner.  Sykes calls after him,
but Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't
turn.

			SYKES
	So, you think there's a connection,
	or what?  Hey!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The slug-mobile pulls up.  A drained Sykes moves up the
walk to his front door.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place
decorated with negative taste.  It's obviously the maid's
decade off.

By rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering
machine on his way into the kitchen.  The tape rewinds.
He opens the fridge.  Not much here.  Left-over take-out
pizza carton.  Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.
Left-over take-out burger wrappers. 

The answering machine message begins -- he glances over
his shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.  During the
following, he reaches the fridge.  Brings out a milk
carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter.  Reaches
in again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly.  Then
searches for a semi-clean glass.

			KRISTIN'S VOICE
		   (bouncy, bride-to-be
		    happy)
	Hi, Daddy, it's me.  I'm over at
	Danny's parents' house... talking
	about Sunday.  I thought maybe you'd
	be home by now.  Anyway, uh, nothing
	really.  I just wanted to call and
	say I love you.  I love you, Daddy.
		   (she giggles)
	Uh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.
	Knowing you, you'll probably pull
	this tape out of your machine and
	save it -- in that drawer where you
	keep every card I ever gave you, and
	all of my old baby teeth... gross!
	Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape
	-- but I do love you, and I'll talk
	to you before Sunday.
		   (beat)
	Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met
	Danny last week.
		   (Sykes stiffens)
	Danny thought Tug was the greatest
	-- but, then, who doesn't?  Anyway,
	love you, talk to you soon.  'Bye.

The machine BEEPS and HISSES.  Sykes take the glass and
the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room,
switching off the answering machine as he goes.

Then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of
the machine and tosses it into a drawer.

				    FADE TO:

INT.  DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee.  He's slept about
four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with
Hagler.  He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk.

			SYKES
	So what've you got on Tuggle's
	killers?

			FEDORCHUK
	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than
	ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on
	it, okay?

			SYKES
	You don't have squat.

			FEDORCHUK
	You ever try to make a case in
	Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer
	informants is about as long as the
	list of Mexican war heroes...

			ALTEREZ
	Up yours.

			FEDORCHUK
	... Nobody talks to nobody down
	there.  Half of them don't speak
	English and the other half only when
	it suits them.  It's gonna take some
	time.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I know it's gonna take time.
	Like until the Ice Capades opens in
	Hell, with you two on it.

Across the room, the Captain's door BANGS open and CAPTAIN
WARNER pounds out, his deep voice booming through the
squad room.

			WARNER
	Nobody wanders off!  I got an
	announcement.  Get your asses back
	in here.

Two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into
the room.  Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner
stands holding a sheet of paper.

			WARNER
	I'll make this short.  This is a
	directive from Chief Evaner, who is
	acting on orders from the Mayor, who
	is under mandate from the Federal
	Bureau of Newcomer Relations.  As of
	nine o'clock this morning, one
	Newcomer uniform officer has been
	promoted to the rank of Detective,
	third grade.

The detectives GROAN... some angrier ones grumble, "This
is bullshit!", etc.

			WARNER
	And we've got him, gentleman.
		   (more groans)
	Volunteers for duty with the new
	detective should see me in my
	office... otherwise I will choose a
	volunteer myself.  That is all.

He turns and heads back to his office in the wake of
continued grumbling from the detectives.  Sykes, standing
to one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass-
walled office.  Waiting inside are a balding man and an
alien in a grey suit.  Sykes reacts.  The alien in the
suit is Jetson.

The grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers
something.

			FEDORCHUK
	Unbelievable bullshit.

			ALTEREZ
	How long has this Slag been on the
	force?  A year, max -- right?

			DETECTIVE
	I don't know about the rest of you,
	but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit
	still for this.  I'm calling the
	union, pronto.

Others grumble.  "Yeah!".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided
something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk
sees this.

			FEDORCHUK
	Where the hell is he going?


INT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sykes KNOCKS and enters.

			WARNER
	Yeah, Sykes?

			SYKES
	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for
	duty with the new detective.

Warner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes.

			WARNER
	... All right.  Detective Sergeant
	Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson.

			JETSON
	We have met.

Warner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes,
starting to smell something fishy.

The balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands.

			GOLDRUP
	Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office.
	Congratulations, gentlemen.

Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to.

			WARNER
		   (to Sykes)
	You are to have nothing to do with
	the investigation into Bill Tuggle's
	death.  You know that.  Leave that
	for Fedorchuk.

			SYKES
		   (nodding)
	Departmental policy.

			WARNER
		   (to Jetson)
	You?

			JETSON
	Yes, sir.

			WARNER
	Good.

			SYKES
	There's another case I'd like to
	take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer
	named Hubley.

Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something.
Sykes avoids his look.

			WARNER
	Granger and Pitts are already on it.

			SYKES
	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a
	caseload... and I would have thought
	with Jetson here being the first
	Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's
	body being found over in the
	Newcomer community...

			WARNER
	Don't tell me what to think.

			GOLDRUP
	He's got a point.  That's the sort
	of thing we should be doing with
	this early advancement program...

Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally
sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

The steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next
to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks
like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all
the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during:

			SYKES
	... and we work my hours.  I'll do
	the driving, you do the paperwork.
	You gotta learn it so you might as
	well do it all.

			JETSON
		   (after a moment)
	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you
	for what you're doing.

			SYKES
	What's that?
		   (then realizing)
	Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in
	your head.  We're not pals, we're
	not married, and we ain't gonna take
	long moonlight walks together...
	We're just partners.  And don't call
	me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or
	Matt if you have to.

			JETSON
	I am George.

Sykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half
steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up
cold.

			SYKES
	Wait a minute.  George?  George
	Jetson?

Jetson nods... he's used to this.
Sykes cracks up.

			SYKES
		   (between laughs)
	Man, somebody really hung one on
	you!  I've heard some good ones for
	you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley
	Davidson.  I guess the people at
	immigration got a little punchy
	after a while, coming up with names
	for a quarter of a million of you.
	You weren't at the back of the line,
	were you, George?

			JETSON
	My true name is Ss'tangya
	T'ssorentsa'.

			SYKES
	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I
	stick to George, do you?


EXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY

They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Anyway, what's it matter to you if
	we think it's funny, right?  Whatta
	you care?

			JETSON
	That is exactly so.
		   (completely deadpan)
	It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm
	sure it doesn't bother you at all
	that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss",
	two words in my language which mean
	"excrement" and "cranium".

Sykes looks at him, perplexed.

			JETSON
	"Shit... head".

Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing
there, the smirk dropping from his face.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY

They're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives.
Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.

			SYKES
	Let's talk Hubley.

			JETSON
		   (refers to a folder
		    he holds)
	His body was discovered three days
	ago, in an alley off of Central
	Avenue, near downtown.

			SYKES
	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the
	chest.

			JETSON
		   (gently correcting
		    him)
	Through the chest.  Rupturing both
	the primary and secondary hearts.

			SYKES
		   (out the window)
	Nice signal, dickwad!

Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes.
Then...

			JETSON
	He was employed at the Northwest
	Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He
	was manager of the Methane Facility.
	He was also a principle partner in a
	real estate venture to develop low-
	cost housing for Newcomers.

Sykes grimaces at the mention of "Newcomer housing".

			SYKES
	Terrific.  A real pillar of the
	community.
		   (beat)
	Was Hubley missing anything when
	they found him?  Was he ripped off?

			JETSON
		   (checks file)
	There was no wallet... but he was
	still wearing a watch and two rings.

			SYKES
	The guys at the mini-mart last night
	made a half-assed stab at the money
	in the till -- but I don't think
	that's what they were there for.  I
	think we got us a couple'a
	executions on our hands, George...

			JETSON
	The murder at the mini-mart is not
	our case.  The Captain said--

Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed.

			SYKES
	Look, you want to fit in here,
	right?  You want to learn how to get
	along?

			JETSON
	Yes.

			SYKES
	Well, there's a thing about
	partners, about being somebody's
	partner.  You do for each other.
	And other people's rules don't mean
	shit.  It's the rules set up between
	the two of you, that's all that
	counts.  Understand?
		   (Jetson nods)
	Okay.  Well, my friend and partner
	was shot last night and I'm after
	the shitbag that did it.  As my
	partner, I'm asking you to respect
	me and help me find him.

Jetson considers this several moments, then--

			JETSON
	And as my partner, I ask you to
	respect me and my desire not to
	break with procedure.

Sykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he
slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy
traffic, puts it in "Park." Jetson, who is already a
little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it.
HORNS instantly go crazy behind them.

			JETSON
	What is wrong?

			SYKES
		   (very calm)
	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get
	something straight.  You agree that
	there's a good chance these two
	shootings are somehow related,
	right?

YELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly
unsettled by the chaos.

			JETSON
	Well... yes, quite possibly.

			SYKES
	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be
	willing to accept the theory,
	George, that... possibly... by
	examining the evidence from one case
	we might shed some small ray of
	light on the other?  Does that sound
	unreasonable to you?

			JETSON
	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable.
	Although I--

			SYKES
	Great.
		   (a relieved sigh)
	Well, I'm sure glad that's settled,
	aren't you?

And with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly
out.

			SYKES
	I think we're really starting to
	click now, George -- hmmm?

Jetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

WINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading
Sykes and Jetson along the hall.  He reads on the fly from
a case file in his hand.

			WINTER
	You know I've been over all this
	with Fedorchuk and Alterez this
	morning...

			SYKES
	Come on.  You got nothin' better to
	do, cushy county job like yours.


INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

They enter briskly through a swinging door.  They move
among the tables (some occupied, some not) during:

			WINTER
	Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck.
	Anyway, according to the sheet, the
	guy you nailed outside by the car--

			SYKES
	The human?

			WINTER
	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder.
	White male, twenty-seven.  Let's
	see... wrap sheet shows one armed
	robbery conviction, a couple for
	sale of a controlled substance.
	Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke
	when you stopped his clock.

They have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter
unceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the
pale naked body of the Raincoat alien.

			JETSON
	Have you identified this one?

			WINTER
	So far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam
	Slag, if you like.

Jetson smiles slightly out of politeness.

			WINTER
	No I.D. on him and -- well, you
	know, no fingerprints -- so it could
	be tough.  Your buddies this morning
	went through the mug book but
	couldn't make a facial match.

			SYKES
	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with
	his hands in his back pockets.

Jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter
and Sykes continue talking off to one side.

			WINTER
		   (referring to
		    Raincoat alien)
	You took this gut out, too, didn't
	you?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			WINTER
	Lucky for you, you got him in both
	of his... well, what we loosely
	refer to as... hearts.

			SYKES
	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my
	damn gun into him.

			WINTER
	That's the way these people are.
	You don't hit both pumps you just
	piss them off.

During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over
-- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his
face.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully.
Then he peels back the alien's upper lip.

Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks
around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER.
Jetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him
using the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remain
oblivious.

			WINTER
	Oh, here's an extra headshot if you
	need one.
		   (hands Sykes a
		    polariod of dead
		    alien's face)
	We're just about to start cutting
	in.  You're welcome to stick around
	if you want.  It's really
	fascinating stuff.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I'll bet.

Sykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in
earnest conversation.  He only catches snatches of the
alien language.  Bentner appears very unsettled by what
Jetson is telling him.  In response to Jetson's final
statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something
Jetson has requested.  Sykes goes over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	What's this?  What's going on?

			JETSON
	Nothing.

			SYKES
		   (really suspicious
		    now)
	Nothing?

			JETSON
		   (looking away)
	Shouldn't we examine their personal
	effects?

Jetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PROPERTY ROOM - COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

Two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents
onto a formica counter.  Sykes looks through the dead
alien's effects while Jetson goes through the human's.
ORTIZ, the college girl working the property counter, sits
nearby doing homework.

Jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown.

			JETSON
	What is this?

			SYKES
		   (looks, then)
	A rubber.  A condom.  You know...
	Coney Island whitefish?
		   (Jetson doesn't know
		    what one is)
	Men, human men, put them on their,
	uh -- penises -- to protect against
	having babies.
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it; Sykes turns
		    to Ortiz)
	You need this for anything?

			ORTIZ
	Nope, got my own.  Anything you guys
	don't use gets stuffed away in
	storage.

Sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles
it before Jetson.

			SYKES
	Get the picture?

			JETSON
		   (frowning)
	And that fits?

			SYKES
	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It
	stretches.

			JETSON
	And still it fits?

Sykes looks at Jetson's serious expression.  He tosses the
condom and packet back into the counter and continues
searching.  A beat, then he can't stop himself -- he
steals a glance at Jetson's crotch.

Still searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's
well-worn heavy work boots.  He grimaces... the sides and
soles are painted with a viscous black substance.  He very
tentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not
what he thought it might be.

			SYKES
	What is this stuff?

Sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe
it.  Jetson glances over.

			JETSON
	It is a resin.

Sykes looks at him... surprised that he knows.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Newcomers working near methane
	gasses at oil refineries must paint
	it on their boots to protect against
	sparks.

			SYKES
	How the hell do you know that?

			JETSON
	A large number of my people were
	hired by refineries because the
	methane fumes are not harmful to us.
	My spouse's brother is one.

			SYKES
	So the Slag they're cutting into
	upstairs worked at a refinery just
	like Hubley worked at a refinery.
		   (beat)
	I'd say that "possible" connection
	between the two cases just got a
	hell of a lot more possible.
		   (beat)
	Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk
	to the wife of the Slag store owner
	blown away last night.

			JETSON
	I believe I should interview the
	widow alone.

			SYKES
	Why the hell--?!
		   (realizes it's
		    because of his lack
		    of "bedside manner")
	Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  MINI-MART - LATE AFTERNOON

The shattered windows have been covered with plywood.
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the
Proprietor's Wife.  She studies a photo Jetson shows her,
nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Sykes drives along beside the mammoth, steaming network of
buildings and pipes that make up the refinery.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Through the loud and smoky refinery we see Sykes walking
with the newly promoted Methane Section manager, O'NEAL,
in tie and shirtsleeves.  The workmen around them are both
human and Newcomer.

			O'NEAL
		   (yelling over the
		    roar)
	Mr. Hubley was an all right guy --
	and a damn good manager.  The men
	liked him.  I'm really gonna have to
	scramble to fill his shoes.

			SYKES
	Well, one of the men didn't like him
	so much...

They stop and Sykes hands O'Neal the polariod photo of
Raincoat alien.  They have stopped near the heavy
refrigeration-type door leading to the "METHANE SECTION".

Newcomer workers move in and out through the door during:

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo)
	You think this is the guy who did
	it?

			SYKES
	We think he could'a been involved,
	yeah.  You know him?

			O'NEAL
	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I
	hate to admit it but -- they all
	still kinda look alike to me.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Who else can I ask around here?

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo
		    again)
	Wait.  You know who it looks like?
	Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James
	Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He
	took the afternoon off.

			SYKES
	I think you're gonna find he's taken
	the rest of his life off.

O'Neal reacts.  Sykes notices the door to the Methane
Section.

			SYKES
	That where Anderson worked?

			O'NEAL
	Yes it is.
		   (some alien workers
		    come through the
		    door)
	Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas
	in there.  I don't know how these
	fellas do it.

Sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the
door.  O'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of
suspicion.

				    CUT TO:

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - SYKES AND O'NEAL

We see Sykes hand O'Neal a card, then move off.  O'Neal
watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts
up this way.
We PAN with him as he enters a door here on the second
level.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  METHANE SECTION CONTROL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

O'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial.
Beyond is a glass wall overlooking the Methane Section.

ANGLE - BELOW

CAMERA TRACKS through the Methane Section... past the
alien workers in lab whites... past all the arcane
equipment and chemical procedures... ending in an EXTREME
CLOSE UP of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills
slowly with a pale blue, viscous liquid.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK

We're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes
pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately
maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown.  Jetson's
WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn
with a garden hose.  Jetson's son, age six, rides his
bicycle along the walkway.  Jetson, dressed in his suit
for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son.

Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes.

			SYKES
	Jesus.  Welcome back Ozzie and
	Harriet...

He HONKS the horn.  Jetson looks up, then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye.  Moves to his son, kisses him
on the top of his head.

Sykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his
derisive expression softens.  As corny as this tableau may
be, there's something very appealing about the innocence
of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.

Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we--

				    CUT TO:

INT.  RESTROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

CLOSE on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug
dispensers from a tuxedo pocket.  As the hand brings the
dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the
exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before.
It makes that distinctive CLINKING NOISE.  We PAN with the
hand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and
sunglasses now.  He wears a black tuxedo.  He lets a small
dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his
tongue.  He swallows... and reacts as the rush from the
drug hits him.

The door to the men's room bangs open and a MIDDLE AGED
POLITICO enters, obviously drunk.

Kipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the
Politico to the exit...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel.

			JETSON
	Mrs. Porter is not taking her
	husband's death well.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Did you learn anything?

			JETSON
	A week ago two men came to see her
	husband.  After they left, he was
	very frightened.  She identified one
	of the men from a photo I showed
	her.  It was Hubley.

			SYKES
	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

			JETSON
	She didn't know him.  But she said
	her son might.

			SYKES
	Did you talk to him?

			JETSON
	He has not been home since that day.
	But she told me where to find him.

Sykes nods.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

The men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns.  Only
two of three Newcomers faces present.  Kipling threads his
way among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's
platform, addresses the assembly.

			MAYOR
	... Our guest speaker tonight has
	done so much in his community and
	for his community in such a short
	period of time.  And I must say, as
	the founder of the first Newcomer
	owned and operated corporation in
	Southern California, he certainly
	has come quite far in the last few
	years.  Granted, not as far as he
	came in the years before reaching
	Los Angeles.

There is laughter from the VIPs.  Kipling slides into a
seat at one of the front tables.  He leans over and
whispers something into the ear of the person seated to
his right.  We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is
whispering to yet.  Whoever it is, nods.

			MAYOR
		   (continuing)
	As Mayor of this city, it gives me
	great pleasure to introduce someone
	who has so readily made our city
	his home... and all of us who live
	here, his friends.  Ladies and
	gentlemen, William Harcourt.

The VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front
table.  At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to
capture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right.
Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer
entrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes
that glint with his piercing intellect.  He rises, smiling
warmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his
right, to make his way to the podium.  He shields his eyes
somewhat from the bright spotlight.

Once behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast
pocket as the applause ebbs.

			HARCOURT
	Thank you all for that very warm
	reception.
		   (pauses, smiles)
	I'm particularly grateful because I
	actually had the gall to write that
	in my notes: "Thank you all for that
	very warm reception".  Imagine how
	embarrassed I would've been if it
	hadn't have been such a warm
	reception.

The VIPs laugh.  He's won them over instantly with his
charm and candor.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT

Sykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on
Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and
Kipling.  We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight
two nights before... but because Kipling looks so
different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright.  Still,
during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure
what.

			SYKES
	William Harcourt?

			HARCOURT
	Yes...

			SYKES
	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is
	Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police
	Department.

			HARCOURT
		   (nodding greeting)
	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't
	aware there were any Newcomers at
	the rank of Detective yet.

			JETSON
	I am the first.

			HARCOURT
	Congratulations.  This is my
	administrative assistant, Rudyard
	Kipling.

			SYKES
		   (throw away)
	Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?
		   (to Harcourt)
	Listen, we just need a minute of
	your time...

			JETSON
	We'd like to ask you about a
	business associate of your, Warren
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	Yes, I heard about poor Warren.
	Tragic.

			SYKES
	You were partners with him on some
	Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate
	thing.

			HARCOURT
	That's right.  He and I, along with
	seven or eight others.  Listen,
	gentlemen, I will be happy to assist
	you in any way I can --
	unfortunately, at the moment, I'm
	overdue at another function.

Suddenly there's a voice from O.S.:

			MAYOR (O.S.)
	William...

Harcourt turns as the Mayor and his WIFE step up.

			HARCOURT
	Mr. Mayor...

			MAYOR
	William, I was wondering if you
	wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and
	me.  Two limousines trying to make
	it across town in all this traffic,
	we're bound to be later than we
	already are.

			HARCOURT
	Excellent idea.  Ray, I wonder if
	you know two of your police
	officers... Detective Jetson and
	Sykes.

			MAYOR
		   (shaking their hands,
		    dismissively)
	A pleasure.
		   (to Harcourt)
	We really should be going.

The wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of
the Mayor with a very impatient expression.  Harcourt
smiles.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	Please feel free to call my office
	Monday morning for an appointment.
		   (to Jetson)
	Congratulations again on your
	promotion, Detective.  Remember...
	you're out there setting an example
	in our community.  I'll be keeping
	an eye on you.

Harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are
penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning.
Harcourt and entourage move off... leaving Sykes steaming.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT

Walking behind the others.  They speak in very low voices;
Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs
during:

			KIPLING
	That cop, the human, he was the one
	who killed Anderson and the driver.

			HARCOURT
	This is becoming a serious breach of
	security.

			KIPLING
	He didn't recognize me.

			HARCOURT
	It is his new partner that I'm
	worried about.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE FIRING RANGE - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

MAFFET, the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands
Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets.
Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing
line.

			SYKES
	Go on ahead.  I'll be right in.
		   (to Maffet, low)
	What'd you dig up for me?

Maffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag
containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore.  By
his manner this deal is definitely not kosher.  Sykes
hefts the weapon.

			MAFFET
	You said you wanted the biggest
	thing I could find... Well, this is
	it.

			SYKES
	What is it?

			MAFFET
	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking
	twice the impact energy of .44
	Magnum hot loads.

			SYKES
		   (flips open cylinder)
	Only holds five.

			MAFFET
	Yeah, the shells are too big for six
	in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you
	don't need but one.

			SYKES
		   (sighting)
	No... two.


EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT

Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking
careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up.  Jetson slips
the protectors down.

			SYKES
	Well, let's see what you got,
	Cochise.  Gimme six, rapid fire.

Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance,
turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target.  It's a
large, sloppy grouping.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	How long you been shooting?  That's
	pitiful.  Whattya gonna do if
	somebody draws down on you, wave
	your scores on the written exam at
	'em?

Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the
Casull.

			JETSON
	Why did you do it?

			SYKES
	Why'd I do what?

			JETSON
	Agree to work with me?  You don't
	like me... you don't like any of us.
	You have nothing but contempt for
	us.  And yet you become an outcast
	from your club of detectives by
	making me your partner...

			SYKES
	My partner is dead!  Because one of
	you bastards killed him -- then
	disappeared into a rathole down in
	Slagtown, where he's home and dry,
	'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody
	says nothing...

Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto
the hanging target form.  He hits the switch, running the
target down to the end of the lane.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	But he didn't figure on you, George.
	You're going to get me through that
	wall of silence.  You're going to
	make them talk to me.  You're going
	to help me find that Slag son-of-a-
	bitch.  Comprendo?  And if Fedorchuk
	and the boys in the bullpen don't
	like it, screw them... and if the
	Captain doesn't like it, screw
	him... and if all the Slags down in
	Slagtown don't like it... well screw
	them too!

Sykes raises the Casull, fires.  KA-BOOM!!!  The shell
rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target
form.  The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up.  KA-
BOOM!!!  again, and another hole is drilled through the
vest.  Other shooters look over.  Sykes sets the gun
down... sees his hand is bleeding.  Jetson absorbs all
this, as we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

A violet neon "X" FILLS FRAME, flashing hypnotically.
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele.
Several ALIEN MEN, brute laborer-types, lounge around out
front.  They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson
climb out of their car.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Okay, just stay back and do what I
	do.  Watch and learn, watch and
	learn...


INT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson walk into the almost total blackness of
this all-Newcomer place.

A few near-infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness.

			SYKES
	I can't see dick in here.

We can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables,
and the bar.  There are maybe twenty figures seated or
standing in the darkness.  The room falls silent in a wave
as Sykes' presence becomes noticed.

Sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his
unhurried movements.

			SYKES
		   (calling into the
		    dark silence)
	Which one'a you Slags is Porter?

			VOICE
		   (from the back of
		    the bar)
	Who wants to know?

Sykes squints into the darkness, then--

			SYKES
		   (aside to Jetson)
	Who said that?

			JETSON
		   (tilts his head to
		    indicate)
	At the end of the bar.

Sykes nods, starts in that direction.

			SYKES
	My name is Sykes.  I'm--

			ALIEN VOICE
	Ss'ai k'ss?

The whole place roars with LAUGHTER.  Too late Sykes
remembers what his name sounds like to them.  He continues
down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his
leg out and trips Sykes with his size 16 work boot.  Sykes
stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender.  Hoots
and derisive LAUGHTER.  He sees only shadows.

			OFFENDER
		   (merely a voice in
		    the dark)
	Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt
	yourself.

More laughter.  Sykes gives the darkness where the
offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his
way to the end of the bar.  Jetson follows.  Sykes stops
behind a big Newcomer in greasy work clothes.

ANGLE

The punk Newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head
down, trying to be inconspicuous.

He glances over at the two cops... his expression shifting
to recognition as he spots Jetson.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes speaks to the Big Newcomer's back.

			SYKES
	You Porter?

The Big Newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk.
Doesn't turn.  Sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns
him around.  The alien grabs Sykes' hand off, rising to
his full height.  He and Sykes lock eyes.  Meanwhile.  the
punk Newcomer (PORTER) has started to slip away unnoticed.
Jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him
by the jacket.

			JETSON
	No, Matthew.  I believe this is the
	one you want.

He pulls Porter back into play.  Now Jetson sees Porter's
face... and he, too, reacts with recognition.

Sykes gives Jetson a sour look, releases the Big Newcomer,
and turns his malice on the punk Newcomer.

			SYKES
	Your name wouldn't happen to be
	Porter, would it?

			JETSON
	Uh, Matthew...

			SYKES
		   (over his shoulder
		    to Jetson)
	Back off, George.

			JETSON
	But I-- (know this man).

			SYKES
	I'll handle it.

Jetson backs off, letting him handle it.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	Jesus, are the questions too tough
	for you already?  Let's try again--
		   (slowly)
	Is your name Porter?

			PORTER
	Ss'kya'ta'.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What's that?

			JETSON
	Screw you.

			SYKES
		   (back to Porter)
	Screw me?  That can't be right.

			PORTER
	Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'.  Ss'trokya'
	ss'lato na'!

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes, low)
	You don't want to know.

			SYKES
	Tell me.

			JETSON
	Your mother mates out of season.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	That's very colorful.  But see --
	now I've got a problem.  I don't
	seem to be getting much cooperation
	from you, Porter.  So I guess we're
	gonna have to take this little
	session down to my office, ya
	know?

And instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on
the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around
him.  Jetson gets a blast of it, too.  The aliens are
momentarily blinded.

Sykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his
face, as he starts to handcuff him.  But Porter gets a
hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight.
Darkness falls... along with Sykes' expression of
satisfaction.

Porter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table.  The
crowd HOOTS and CHEERS.  Sykes finds his way to his feet.

			JETSON
	Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this).

			SYKES
	Stay back!  I'm okay.

He charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club.
The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity
and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin.
Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises
again -- smiling.

			PORTER
	Don't they teach you anything about
	us in cop school, little ss'loka'?

Porter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver
a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into FRAME, locking
with Porter's, blocking the punch.  It is Jetson.

			JETSON
	Enough.

			PORTER
		   (eyeing Jetson)
	Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.  You're a
	cop.
		   (with some contempt)
	It fits you.

Jetson says something to him in the alien language.
Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back
exit.  Sykes stumbles over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	You know that guy?

			JETSON
		   (nods)
	From quarantine, when my people
	first arrived here.  He and I were
	housed together.

			SYKES
	How could a straight-arrow like you
	ever pick a roommate like him?

			JETSON
	In the camps, we were lodged four to
	a room.  The selection process was
	entirely random.  We did not get to
	stay with our friends... or
	families...

And he moves toward the back exit.  Sykes watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Porter leans against an alley wall.  He speaks English
learned on the streets.

			JETSON
	You don't know what your father and
	these two men were arguing about?

			PORTER
	I told you -- I was in the back of
	the store.  I just heard voices,
	muffled like.

			SYKES
	One of the two men was Hubley,
	right?  What about the other one?
	Did you know him?

			PORTER
	Yeah... I seen him around.  High-
	roller dude named Strader.  Joshua
	Strader.  Runs a club on the west
	side.  Encounters.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I heard of it.

			PORTER
	That's all I know.  You want
	anything more, you ask somebody
	else.

He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the
bar.

			JETSON
	I am sorry about your father.

Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then
disappears through the door.  Sykes and Jetson start down
the alley.

			JETSON
	If I may make a suggestion... We
	have different weak spots than you
	do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve
	plexus under the arm, here, will
	produce the effect I think you were
	looking for.

			SYKES
	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien
Language.  The SERVERS are teen aged humans and aliens.

Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their
order.

			KID
		   (serving them)
	Six forty-two.

They both put money on the counter.  The kid goes to put
the order together.  Sykes looks at the alien characters
on the menu.

			SYKES
	I don't think I could ever learn to
	read that shit.
		   (beat)
	How long did it take you to learn
	English?

			JETSON
	Three months.
		   (off Sykes' look)
	We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is
	our strength... what we were bred
	for, to adapt to hostile
	environments.

The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Thank you.

They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of
the bags as they talk:

			SYKES
	My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer
	girl in his class.  She's six years
	old and in seventh grade already...

They climb into the car.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson doesn't respond... some things are better left
unaddressed.  Meanwhile, Sykes has unwrapped his food and
recoils in disgust.

			SYKES
	Oh, God.  I think I got yours
	here...

He holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal
fur still on them.  Jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the
dripping cheeseburger he's just unwrapped.  They quickly
trade.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Which one is that?  Raw what?

			JETSON
		   (eating a strip)
	This is mole.  It's good.

			SYKES
	I'll bet.
		   (winces, watching him
		    chew)
	Would it really put you out if they
	tossed that on the grill for a
	minute or two?

			JETSON
	Our bodies do not assimilate the
	nutrients if the food has been
	cooked.

Jetson looks over at him, smiling.

			SYKES
	Oh, that's real attractive.  You got
	fur in your teeth, George.  Come on,
	man, we're gonna be talking to
	people... jeez.

Sykes looks at his burger, his appetite gone, shoves it
back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat.


INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Sykes pulls onto the street.

			SYKES
	So what was that other word for
	Human... Slow ka?

			JETSON
	Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small
	but intelligent creature".
		   (Sykes looks over,
		    doesn't know if he
		    likes this)
	It loses much in the translation.

			SYKES
	And what was that one about my
	mother?  That was a good one.

			JETSON
	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.

Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly.  After several tries, he can say it passably
well.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club.  The
antithesis of the "X" bar.  A human HOSTESS in a slit
dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a
table.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage.

REVERSE ANGLE

revealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the MUSIC.

Sykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and
Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a
human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.

			JETSON
	You are Cassandra?

			CASSANDRA
	That's right.

			JETSON
	We are with the Police Department.
	This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

			CASSANDRA
		   (laughing)
	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

			SYKES
	We're looking for your boss --
	Strader.

She eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage,
assuming they will follow.


INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

She moves along the narrow corridor.

			CASSANDRA
	He's not here.  Why ask me?

			JETSON
	The young woman at the front said
	you might know where he is.

			CASSANDRA
	She did, did she?  Well, she was
	wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.

			SYKES
	No problem.

She moves through a door.  Sykes follows closely so does
Jetson.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall.

			SYKES
	Look, we're not here doing an
	interview for the school paper.
	This is a homicide investigation...
	and if you don't stop jerkin' us
	around, I'm ready to start playin'
	hardball.

Jetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room.
Sykes rapidly motions to him to "go look around".  Jetson
mimes back, "Huh?"

			CASSANDRA
		   (slipping out of her
		    dance costume)
	Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds
	interesting.  Are you going to
	strike me?  You could tie me up and
	then do whatever you want with me...
	I've got my own ropes.

			SYKES
		   (still miming to
		    Jetson)
	Does that cost extra or you throw
	them in?

			CASSANDRA
	You've got me all wrong.  I don't
	charge money for something that I
	myself find pleasurable...

Finally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him.  He
says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:

			JETSON
	I am going out to the car.  I will
	meet you there.

Sykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor.
Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish,
low-cut dress.

			CASSANDRA
	Look, I don't know where Mr.
	Strader might be.  He comes and he
	goes.

			SYKES
		   (starting to feel a
		    little uncomfortable)
	The girl out front mentioned
	Strader's assistant, somebody named
	Watson.  Maybe he knows.

			CASSANDRA
		   (tensing slightly)
	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.

She is very close to Sykes now.  She fingers the lapel of
his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
		   (continuing)
	I know... Why don't you hang around
	for a while, let me entertain you?
	It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the
	truth, have you ever... made it...
	with one of us?

			SYKES
	Not unless I got real drunk and
	nobody told me about it later.

			CASSANDRA
	A virgin.  I find that very
	arousing...


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MUSIC drifts up from downstairs.  Jetson moves along the
corridor, scoping things out.  He tries a door.  Locked.
Tries another one.  Open.  He eases it wider, then enters
the darkened office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the office.  Looks around.  Makes his
way to the cluttered desk top.  Pushes things around...
all the usual stuff.  He starts to turn away, then his eye
catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger
books.  He reaches for it.  A small dispenser -- of the
kind we saw being filled at the refinery.  Jetson studies
it, his suspicions growing.  Opening it, he finds only the
barest trace of a viscous substance.

He smells it... not enough to tell for certain what it is.
But enough that he is very concerned about what it could
be.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now.
She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her
facial ridges.  She shudders with pleasure.  Sykes begins
to perspire.

			SYKES
	There's lots of things I haven't
	done, but his ain't high on the
	list.  Don't take it personally.

			CASSANDRA
	I think you're just a little scared
	now, about what you might find once
	the lights go out.  A little
	scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe
	more than you want to admit.  But
	doesn't that turn you on, that
	curiosity and fear, swirling
	together?
		   (coos)
	Think of it as broadening your
	horizons.

			SYKES
	I like my horizons narrow.

			CASSANDRA
		   (pressing herself
		    into him)
	Your voice is saying no, but your
	body is saying yes.

He quickly disengages from her.

			SYKES
	My voice, body, and everything else
	is saying I'll be back in two hours
	for Strader, and he better damn well
	be here.

He shoves a business card at her, then retreats through
the door.


INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes closes the door and lets out his breath.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she
quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom
button.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom
BUZZ in the next room.  Through the wall--

			WATSON (O.S.)
		   (tentatively)
	Yes...?

			CASSANDRA (O.S.)
		   (over the intercom,
		    breathless)
	Todd, it's me.  The police were just
	here... looking for Strader.  And
	asking about you.

Jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office,
drawing his gun.  The floor squeaks beneath his feet.  He
looks down, then continues toward the door.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson eases open the door.  It's the manager's private
office.  Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the
desk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray --
but no one behind the desk.  Jetson eases through the door
and--

-- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door!
Jetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Jetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed
office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes hears the fight through the private office door.
He throws the door open.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at
Jetson's assailant.

			SYKES
	Freeze!  Now!

The assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing
hard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is
TODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.

Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking
him sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson
seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into
some furniture and dives for the door.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape.
Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong
as he is, but he has the edge in experience.

Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway,
ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went.

			SYKES
		   (struggling with
		    Cassandra)
	Fire escape!  End of the hall!

Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to
get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff
around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at
him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and
charges down the corridor.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Jetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees
Watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area.

Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen
feet to the ground.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires
it up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls
his gun, aims.

The white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there,
gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split
second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to
avoid being hit.


INT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT

Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes
standing right in front of the car.  He hits the gas.
Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car.
Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass,
panics and--


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.

Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.

Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson
folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees.

			SYKES
		   (breathing hard)
	I'll be damned.  It worked.
		   (sees Jetson run up)
	How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo!
	Both barrels.  Dropped him like a
	bag of cement.

Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the
I.D.

			SYKES
	Who is he?

			JETSON
	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.

Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one
agonized breath.

			WATSON
	I don't believe this.  Look at my
	suit.  Look at what you made me do
	to my car.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Your girlfriend put up a better
	fight than you did, pal.

			JETSON
	We are looking for your employer,
	Joshua Strader.

			WATSON
	He's out of town.

			JETSON
	Why did you run?

			WATSON
	Because you two were chasing me.

			SYKES
	We were chasing you because you ran,
	you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

			JETSON
	When will Strader return?

			WATSON
	Who knows.  He's the boss -- he
	doesn't have to check in with me.

			SYKES
		   (wearily)
	Watson... this is my partner here's
	first coupla days, and he wants to
	make a good impression.  Me, though,
	the way I feel -- this could be my
	last day, know what I mean?  And I'm
	ready to rain on you like a cow
	pissin' on a flat rock.

			WATSON
	Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been
	around for a coupla days.  He didn't
	tell me where he was going or when
	he'd be back.  I swear it.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What do you think?

			JETSON
	I believe he is probably lying.

			SYKES
	Through his ass.
		   (to Watson)
	Next time you see him, tell him to
	call me... unless you want us to
	keep coming back on you like a bad
	case of herpes.

Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car.

ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON

as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	George, you can handle the women
	from now on, you mind?

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he
hears footsteps.  He turns with a "What now?" expression
and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He
goes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN
THUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's
employ.

			QUINT
		   (to other Thugs)
	Okay, scrape him up.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT

Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access
road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.
van.

Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back
of the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three
human Thugs.

They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing
the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.

			HARCOURT
	Any progress?

			QUINT
	My arm's gettin' tired and so far,
	zip.

			KIPLING
	He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to
	Strader.

			QUINT
	What's that mean?

			KIPLING
	Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to
	Strader is above pain or life.

			QUINT
	You tellin' me this guy would die
	before he'd screw his boss and work
	for us?  Nobody's that dumb.

			KIPLING
	It is something you couldn't
	comprehend, Quint.

Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.

			HARCOURT
	I understand you have been resisting
	my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of
	duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --
	no longer an issue, I'm afraid...

Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot
twice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes
widen in fear.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	I will not make this offer again.  I
	want you to work for me, to manage
	the nightclub as Strader's successor.
	If you do, you will know a wealth
	and comfort our people never dared
	imagine...

Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.

			WATSON
	Sss'k'a ta'!

Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring
his resolve.  Then--

			HARCOURT
	It is such a pity to die for an
	outmoded value.
		   (rising)
	Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for
	our friend's swimming lesson.

Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.

			HARCOURT
		   (to Watson)
	It's important to learn new skills.
	Essential to your growth as a
	person.

Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.  He bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf.  Quint
addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.

			QUINT
	You never seen this before, have
	you, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't
	gonna believe it... seawater is like
	battery acid to these guys... I
	don't know what it is, some kinds
	chemical reaction.  Whatta you think
	it is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him.
		   (a wave breaks
		    outside, the foam
		    rolls in)
	What I love about the surf is you
	can never tell how far up it's going
	to come until it... whoops, got a
	little wet there.

The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.  He
screams.  Flailing, one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water.  He howls and yanks out his hand.
We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand.  The Thugs get Watson swinging.

			QUINT
	Last call, sucker.  One... two...
	THREE!

Watson is flung into the surf.

ANGLE

Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline.  We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then
nothing.  Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.
Harcourt seems unperturbed.

			KIPLING
	When we picked him up, he was
	talking to those two cops -- the two
	who came to question you about
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	This is getting out of hand.  I want
	you to deal with it.  Immediately.

A wave rushes up the sand.  Kipling quickly steps back.
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	We must learn to embrace the things
	we fear... and from that grow
	strong.

A moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.
He motions to Strader's body and the surf.  The Thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the
kitchen wall phone.  Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle
of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a
glass, pours himself a shot.  As Jetson is talking, he
spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out
of the refrigerator two nights ago.

He sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement.
He finishes with his wife and hangs up.  He watches Sykes
take a long pull on the vodka.

			JETSON
		   (holds up milk
		    carton)
	Would you mind?

Sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass.  Jetson pours the semi-
lumpy milk and takes a big swallow.  Sykes grimaces.
Then--

			SYKES
		   (indicates phone)
	So, she keeps you on a pretty short
	leash, does she?

			JETSON
	My wife?  She worries about me.

Sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his
voice more weary then bitter.

			SYKES
	Yeah... I know the routine.

			JETSON
	You are married?

			SYKES
	Was.  Divorced.

			JETSON
	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a
	strange concept to us.

			SYKES
	It's like having an eleventh finger
	removed.  It hurts like hell, but
	you never really needed the damn
	thing in the first place.

Jetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand
this.  They drink... Jetson gazes around.

			JETSON
	Your home is quite disordered.  I
	thought perhaps you had been
	burglarized when I walked in.

			SYKES
		   (growling)
	I appreciate your honesty, George.

He smacks his glass against Jetson's.  They drink.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

Sykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared
photo.

			SYKES
	Ignore the bitch on the left, that's
	Edie.  I call her Edi Amin... This
	is Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda
	an old picture... she's twenty now.
	Getting married, in fact... on
	Sunday.

Jetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the
proffered photo.  They're both a little drunk now.

			JETSON
	Human children can be very
	beautiful.
		   (then)
	Getting married?  Congratulations.
	You will be taking Sunday off,
	then...

			SYKES
		   (uneasy)
	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not
	sure I'm gonna go.
		   (mumbles)
	She doesn't need her burn-out of a
	father there...

Jetson looks at him.  Sees something he never thought
possible in Sykes.  Vulnerability.  Trying to break the
melancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet.

			JETSON
		   (upbeat)
	I must show you...
		   (flips open wallet,
		    shows four crisp
		    photos of his wife)
	And this is Richard.  My son.  He's
	four years old.  We named him after
	the former President, Richard Nixon.

Sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table...
and has to laugh.  He looks up at Jetson's sincere face.
He may be starting to like this guy.

			SYKES
	You open to a piece of advice?  Tell
	people you named him after Richard
	Burton, the actor.  Just take my
	word for it.

And he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the
table, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

They are quite a bit drunker.  Jetson has doffed his
jacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes.

			SYKES
	... and so, and so the doctor says,
	"If this is the thermometer, then
	where'd I leave the pen?"
		   (laughs raucously,
		    Jetson doesn't
		    react)
	You're not... you don't think that's
	funny?  George, work with me, I
	always get a laugh with that one.
	Look, if the doctor's got the
	thermometer in his hand, then
	where's his pen gotta be?

			JETSON
		   (straight-faced)
	In the other man's rectum.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Sticking out of his ass... yeah!
	See, that's what makes it a joke.
	There's like a surprise, and your
	mind fills in the funny picture.
	Here's this guy with a pen stuck in
	his ass and he thinks it's a
	thermometer.
		   (Jetson just blinks)
	Nada, huh?

Jetson shrugs apologetically.  Sykes pours them each
another round.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Your health...

			JETSON
	Ta ss'trakyona'...

They CLACK glasses, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER STILL

The party has moves into the living room floor, around the
coffee table.  It's a quieter moment.

			JETSON
	There is so much our two peoples
	don't understand about each other.

			SYKES
	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from
	another goddamn planet, for
	chrissakes.

			JETSON
	You humans are very curious to us.
	You invite us to live among you, in
	an atmosphere of equality we've
	never known before.  You lay before
	us a beautiful green world, full of
	freedoms and opportunities... You
	give us ownership of our lives for
	the first time... and you ask no
	more of us than you do of
	yourselves: to live by the rules...
	rules that aren't made to keep one
	people subordinate to another, but
	rules that exist to preserve
	equality.  You aspire to very high
	ideals here.

Sykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized.  The guy's never
said this much at one time before.

If he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up
to a human like this.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	I hope you can understand how
	special your world is... how unique
	a people you humans are.  So it us
	all the more painful and confusing
	to us that so few of you seem
	capable of living up the the ideals
	you set for yourselves.

			SYKES
	Don't count on me, George.  I never
	had any ideals.

Jetson smiles a little.  He knows that's bullshit.

			JETSON
	We don't understand the hatred, the
	contempt.  But we must bear it... we
	must not react in anger... because
	our situation here is still fragile.
	The separationists would see us
	returned to the quarantine camps.
	The fundamentalists say we have no
	more human rights than dogs or cats.
	But the prejudice we face here is so
	insignificant compared to the pain
	that we've known before.  And that
	is why we are so grateful.

Sykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes.
Finally--

			SYKES
	Yeah, well... except I did hear you
	eat your dead.

Jetson looks at him a long beat, then--

			JETSON
		   (deadpan)
	Only on Fridays.

Sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then
explodes with laughter.

			SYKES
	You son-of-a-bitch.  You're okay.

Jetson stands unsteadily, and announces:

			JETSON
	I'm going home.

			SYKES
	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You
	do sleep, don't you?

Jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his
shoulder without turning around.  He's gone.

			SYKES
	What a wildman...

Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward
onto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN

The first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes
remains passed out on the sofa where we left him.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

The slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the
RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner.

The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-
mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint.

Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then
slides behind the wheel.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN

Quint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a
packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and
two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down,
starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears
from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the
seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back
seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He
sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy.

Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works.
Mistake.

Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees
this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his
brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the
face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his
face.  That was the last thing he needed.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car.
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck.

It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand.
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien
phrase, clearly the equivalent of "Fuck it...".

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY

Sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left
him.  Someone is POUNDING on the door.  He regains
consciousness reluctantly.

			SYKES
	This better be good news or money.

He shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting
Jetson.  Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief
with one hand and gives it to Sykes.

			JETSON
	Hold this.
		   (lurching to the
		    sink)
	I feel very terrible.

Sykes registers what he's holding.  He moves to Jetson,
who is running his head under the tap.

			SYKES
	Where'd you get this?!!

			JETSON
	A man, a human, was wiring it to
	your car.  I didn't get a good look
	at him.
		   (then, registering
		    that it's day;
		    panicked)
	I must call my wife...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

Jetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing
rumpled and a day old.  Sykes has showered and changed so
he's not suffering as much by comparison.  They approach
Sykes' desk.

			JETSON
	She's going to divorce me.

			SYKES
	George, she's not gonna divorce you.
	You mate for life, remember?

			JETSON
	She's very progressive.  I'm certain
	she's considering it.

ANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY

distributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes.

			SECRETARY
	You guys are looking for somebody
	named Strader, right?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			SECRETARY
	Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned
	in.  They found him.
		   (Sykes and Jetson
		    react)
	Or at least what's left of him,
	washed up on the beach at Zuma.

Sykes and Jetson react again.

			SECRETARY
		   (continuing; handing
		    over  the message
		    slip)
	They're still there if you wanna
	catch them.

She moves off.

			SYKES
	Well, let's roll, George.

			JETSON
		   (with a stricken
		    expression)
	To the... to the beach?

			SYKES
	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - ZUMA BEACH - DUSK

CRANE SHOT, nice and WIDE, showing the slug-mobile turning
off P.C.H. onto a gravel road which curves down the the
beach.  The following is V.O. as the car approaches the
water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Why?

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Please, I must get out here.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Come on, you won't have to get near
	the water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car!

We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

			SYKES
	All right, okay.  Keep your
	pantyhose on.  Jeez, when in doubt,
	freak out, for chrissake.

Sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen
of sweat, his hands shaking.  Sykes softens.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	It's all right, George.  It's cool.
	Just wait here, all right?  I'll be
	back in a coupla minutes.

			JETSON
	Thank you.

He climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach... toward
a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a
coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan.


EXT.  BEACH - DUSK

A quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a
person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk
suit.  Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and
other high tide detritus.

ANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ

looking down at the body.  A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing
a closer inspection.

			FEDORCHUK
	Found his wallet in his jacket
	pocket.  Joshua Strader, big as
	life.

			CORONER'S TECH
	Jesus, what a mess.  It's gonna be a
	bear to make a positive
	determination, but it looks to me
	like he was shot before being tossed
	in the drink.  At least twice--
		   (indicates where
		    hearts  would've
		    been on the body)
	-- here, and here.

Sykes absorbs this.  He rises along with Fedorchuk and
Alterez.

			SYKES
	How're you two doing on Tuggle's
	killer?

			ALTEREZ
	The store owner's son is in a street
	gang, so now we're thinking maybe
	it's gang related.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's real good.  You guys
	follow up on that for a coupla
	months.

Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above.

			FEDORCHUK
	Look at your dildo partner.  He's
	too scared to even come down to the
	sand.
		   (calls up to Jetson,
		    even though he's too
		    far away to hear)
	You're not gonna get wet standing
	here, moron!

			SYKES
	I'd like to see you next to a sea of
	hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see
	how much surfin' you'd do.

Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body.  Sykes grabs it as
it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car.
Fedorchuk flips him the bird.  As Sykes rounds the car, he
sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid
chalk marker a big star with "E.T. P.D." printed inside
it.  Sykes looks around.  Fedorchuk and the others stand
together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his
direction.

			SYKES
	Cute.


EXT.  BEACH ROAD - DUSK

Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up.

He's wiping the "E.T. P.D."  from the door as Jetson
approaches from the edge of the bluff.  Fedorchuk pulls up
alongside in his n.d. sedan.  He calls off to Jetson, who
is still twenty yards away.

			FEDORCHUK
	Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
	Forget you hip waders, big guy?

			SYKES
	Lay off, asshole.

			FEDORCHUK
	I may be an asshole, but at least
	I'm a real detective, not some outer
	shit space thing.

Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be
highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans
against it.

			SYKES
	Yeah?  you're a real honest-to-god
	detective...?

Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into
the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt
his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with).

He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing
Fedorchuk's car keys with the other.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Then detect these!

Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car
keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff.  Jetson, just
climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this
scene without knowing how it began.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

Sykes gets in, slams the door.  His hand hurts as he grabs
the wheel.  He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the
car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward P.C.H.
Jetson looks over, curious.

			JETSON
	What was that about?

			SYKES
		   (embarrassed that he
		    defended Jetson)
	Nothing.

On Jetson's confused expression, we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

A different burger stand.  Sykes and Jetson sit across
from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with
his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips.  This time
they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they
talk.

			SYKES
	... So we've got three guys dead.
	All Newcomers, all killed the same
	way -- execution style.

			JETSON
	Warren Hubley was in middle
	management at a refinery... Joshua
	Strader operated a successful bar
	and nightclub...

			SYKES
	... and Porter ran a piece of shit
	mom-and-pop mini-mart.
		   (beat)
	So what the hell's the connection?

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PATHOLOGY LAB OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office.  Winter
is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk.

			SYKES
	You guys finished the postmortem on
	Strader yet?

			WINTER
		   (his mouth full)
	You mean the Blob?  They're
	finishing up now.

			JETSON
	Is Bentner here?  I must speak with
	him.

			WINTER
	He went home early -- his kid was
	sick.

Jetson frowns.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Yeah, but he left something for you.

He wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an
envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson.  Jetson tears
open the sealed envelope.  The message inside is written
in the alien language.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Does this have something to do with
	the test he ran that he wouldn't
	tell me about?

CLOSE ON - JETSON

His expression grows stricken as he reads the message.

BACK TO SCENE

			SYKES
		   (getting very curious
		    and suspicious now)
	What kind of test?

			WINTER
	Looking for some foreign compound in
	the blood of that alien you dropped
	the other day.

			SYKES
	Did he find anything?

Winter shrugs, indicates the message Jetson reads, as if
to say, "Maybe it says in there".

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Well?

Jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket.

He is clearly disturbed by what he has read.  He looks at
Sykes a moment, then quickly breaks eye contact.

			JETSON
	It is nothing.

Jetson quickly moves off.  Sykes hurries off after him.


INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking Jetson.
They eventually reach the elevators and Jetson jabs the
button during:

			SYKES
	What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't
	nothing yesterday when you asked
	Bentner to run that test and he
	looked like he was about to shit
	peach pits, and it's not nothing
	now.  Don't lie to me, George,
	you're bad at it.

			JETSON
		   (distant, closed)
	You must leave me alone on this.

The elevator arrives, he steps in.  Sykes follows.


INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT

They enter the empty elevator.  Jetson presses the button
to descend.

			SYKES
	No, see, I don't leave you alone...
	I'm your partner.  I don't work that
	way... Tug didn't work that way.

Jetson remains steadfast.  Sykes, about to explode, slams
his palm against the red Emergency Stop button and the
elevator lurches to a halt between floors.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	No secrets, goddammit!  You don't
	hold back from me.  Whatever is
	going on, you're gonna tell me now!

			JETSON
		   (agonizing)
	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is
	not your concern.

			SYKES
	The hell it isn't, when somebody
	wires up enough C-4 explosive to my
	car to turn me into pink mist!
		   (beat)
	That Slag was on something, and not
	sour milk, either?  Am I right?
		   (he has backed Jetson
		    to the wall by sheer
		    force of will)
	TELL ME!  What is it?

			JETSON
		   (finally)
	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us
	it is a potent narcotic.

			SYKES
	How potent?

			JETSON
	Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The
	"high" lasts several hours.  We
	would receive small amounts of it...
	as a reward for our labor.

			SYKES
	We?  You've taken it?

			JETSON
	We all did.

			SYKES
	Where did he get it?  Was there any
	of it on the ship?

			JETSON
	No... I am sure not.  That is why I
	am so concerned... someone must now
	be producing it here.
		   (emphatically)
	But none of my people know how to
	make it.  The process was carefully
	guarded.

			SYKES
		   (as the enormity
		    sinks in)
	Jesus, this is major.
		   (then)
	Why didn't you tell me sooner?
	Why'd you hold out on me?

			JETSON
	Your people don't know about this
	part of out past.  And they can't
	know -- It would threaten our entire
	existence here.

The voltage runs out of Sykes.  He seems to understand
Jetson's dilemma.

			SYKES
	George... look me in the eye...
	George, you don't ever lie to me
	again.

			JETSON
	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot
	stop this without you.

Sykes stare at Jetson... absorbing the enormity of the
earth-shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile.  Sykes
reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching
hand.  He winces in pain... the son-of-a-bitch still
hurts.  He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger
door.

			SYKES
	George?  How about you drive...

Jetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote
of confidence.  They walk quickly around to the opposite
doors, climb in.


INT.  CORRIDOR - BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move down this government-building
corridor.

			SYKES
	There's gotta be some other
	connection.

They enter a door marked BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS.


INT.  BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

HIGH SHOT showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling
this huge room.  It's all but deserted.  Sykes and Jetson
are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) COMPUTER
OPERATOR, who they're shanghaied into helping them after
hours.

CLOSER - AT COMPUTER OPERATOR'S DESK

She sits at her computer terminal.  Sykes and Jetson stand
behind her as she types in commands and information.

She types: Hubley, Warren.  The computer screen flashes
past various information, then settles on a screen full of
information of HUBLEY, WARREN.

			OPERATOR
	Here's Hubley.
		   (scanning it)
	Left Quarantine on November
	thirtieth, relocated first to
	Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles
	early in February the following
	year.  Field of expertise: chemical
	manufacturing.  Looks like he passed
	up several other better paying jobs
	waiting for that one at the
	refinery.

			SYKES
	Try Joshua Strader, will ya,
	darlin'?

			OPERATOR
	For you, anything.

The Operator punches up STRADER, JOSHUA.  The screen fills
with information.

			OPERATOR
		   (continuing, reading
		    from screen)
	Released on November twenty-ninth.
	Came immediately to L.A.  Ten weeks
	after arriving he took over the
	abandoned club which is now
	Encounters.

			JETSON
		   (to Operator)
	Now the store owner, please.  Cecil
	Porter.

She types it in.

			OPERATOR
	Released December one.  He and his
	wife moved first to Modesto, then
	Coalinga, California -- wherever
	that is -- settled in L.A. in
	April.  Field of expertise:
	organic chemical engineering.  He
	and his wife have one child, a son.

			SYKES
	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful
	boy... close personal friend of
	George's here.

			OPERATOR
	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems
	to be matching up...

But Sykes wasn't listening.  He's starting off... an idea
forming.  He stands there a moment, considering it, his
face looking like he's chewing something sour.  It's so
off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it.
Then--

			SYKES
	Holy shit...
		   (to Jetson)
	Look what we're staring at: three
	Newcomers with nothing in common,
	right?  What if it's just one other
	guy who killed these three?
		   (Jetson looks at him
		    blankly)
	Three and one make four.  Four
	Newcomers... of totally different
	backgrounds...
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it)
	You and the store owner's son --
	that punker!

Suddenly the realization hits Jetson, too.  He looks at
Sykes.

			JETSON
	... Quarantine.

Sykes spins to the Operator, excited.

			SYKES
	Can you dig up their Quarantine
	records in this thing?

			OPERATOR
	Sure.  Just a minute.

She moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information. 

			OPERATOR
		   (to herself)
	Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.

She rapidly types in additional information.  The screen
shifts as she jumps files.  Finally she gets a line that
reads: ENTER LODGE NUMBER: She types: 7-7-2.

Sykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank... then
information flashes past as the computer searches... then,
finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: HUBLEY,
WARREN......... STRADER, JOSHUA.........

Sykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true.

On the computer screen: .........PORTER, CECIL.........

Sykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of
the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth
name.

On the computer screen: .........HARCOURT, WILLIAM.

CLOSE ON - SYKES AND JETSON

reacting to the name.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

CLOSE on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure
rises from the back seat.  We TILT UP to reveal William
Harcourt.

We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the
beach scene) parked in front of the limousine.  Kipling is
just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab.  Quint
exits the driver door.  Kipling slides open the van's side
panel, reaches in for--

-- a large black suitcase.  He slides it out.  Harcourt
nods.  He and Kipling start into the club, followed by
Quint.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage
move toward the back.


EXT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second
floor.  Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top
of the stairs waiting for them.  She's very uncomfortable
dealing with Harcourt.  Kipling and Quint continue on
toward the office door.  Harcourt pauses with Cassandra.
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers
linger against her flesh.

			HARCOURT
	Quite lovely...
		   (best)
	What is your name again?

			CASSANDRA
		   (flinching
		    involuntarily at
		    his touch)
	Cassandra.

			HARCOURT
		   (a chilling smile)
	I will have to remember that...

He continues down toward the office door.  Cassandra
watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - MOVING - NIGHT

			JETSON
	They had months in quarantine to
	develop the plan.  Porter, with his
	chemistry background, must have
	somehow come up with the formula for
	the drug.  Hubley manufactured it --
	at the refinery.  Strader, through
	the nightclub, established a
	distribution network.  And
	Harcourt--

			SYKES
	Harcourt was the brain who brought
	it all together.


EXT.  REFINERY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT


EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock
entrance.  Sykes and Jetson climb out.  They hop up onto
the loading platform and move purposefully into the well-
lit interior through the open door.


INT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

It is Saturday night, the plant is barely operational --
only a few WORKERS around.  Sykes and Jetson move
purposefully toward the back.

			SYKES
	Okay, George -- we gotta play this
	real smart.

			JETSON
	If the drug is here, we must destroy
	it.

			SYKES
	No, George -- you're missing the
	point.  The drug is evidence.  We
	need to have the evidence, ya know?

Jetson doesn't reply -- he's focused beyond what Sykes is
saying.  Sykes spots O'Neal up ahead by the refrigeration
door to the METHANE SECTION.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	That's the guy...

O'Neal recognizes Sykes and doesn't wait around for the
big Newcomer bearing down on him.  He dodges quickly
through the refrigeration door and swings it closed.
Jetson's hand hits the door an instant later, before it is
latched, and he pushes it open despite O'Neal's body
weight against the other side.


INT.  METHANE ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson grabs O'Neal by the collar and drags him deeper
into the deserted room.

			O'NEAL
	Hey, what are you, crazy?!  You
	can't come in here like this!  Hey!

Sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares.

			SYKES
	So much for playing it smart...

O'Neal's feet are barely touching the ground as Jetson
moves along the row of drug-manufacturing equipment.

Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long
finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the
drug.  It glistens blue on his finger.  It holds him
mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a
former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so.

			SYKES
		   (tentatively
		    stepping closer)
	Is that it...?

A beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of
equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from
his hand onto O'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins
the bug-eyed O'Neal to the wall.

			SYKES
	Uh, George...

			JETSON
		   (in O'Neal's face)
	Where is the drug?  Where have they
	taken it?

			O'NEAL
		   (choking)
	What drug?  This is an oil refinery,
	you...

			JETSON
		   (pushing harder)
	WHERE?!

			O'NEAL
		   (unable to breathe)
	You... can't do... this!

			SYKES
	George, uh... you're gonna break his
	little chest bones...

			JETSON
	Stay out of this, Matthew.
		   (to O'Neal)
	Tell me where the drug has been
	taken or I will crush your lungs
	against this wall.

O'Neal is experiencing real fear now.  Sykes has decided
to back Jetson up, for better or worse.  He takes the
"good cop" role.

			SYKES
	Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he
	gets like this, I can't control him.
	I've seen this before.  He got like
	this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's
	spine out and show it to him.
	Nothing I could do.  I hadda go
	throw up.

			O'NEAL
		   (at length, with
		    great effort)
	... They took the stuff out, all of
	it -- this afternoon.

			JETSON
	How much?

			O'NEAL
	About fifty kilos... of
	concentrate... and some street
	grade... in tubes.

Jetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure.
O'Neal is really in bad trouble now.  Even Sykes takes a
half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush
this man.

			JETSON
	Where have they taken it?

			O'NEAL
	Encount... Encounters Club.

Finally, Jetson eases off.  O'Neal slumps to the floor,
gasping for air.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

This time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set
and hard... as he strides to the car.  Sykes practically
has to run to keep up.

			SYKES
	George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's
	a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it
	-- we got him by the short hairs.
	He ain't gonna make any more of the
	shit.

			JETSON
	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to
	find it.  I can't let it get out on
	the street.

			SYKES
	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?

Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,
yanks it open.

			SYKES
		   (continuing; as
		    Jetson starts the
		    car
	You destroy that drug, you destroy
	the case.  Don't blow the whole
	thing now by not following
	procedure.

			JETSON
		   (through the open
		    driver's window)
	Fuck procedure.

And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels
out.

			SYKES
	Hey!!

Jetson accelerates toward the security gate.  The guard in
the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile
bashes through the barricade bar.

			SYKES
	GEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!!

Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no
car.  A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off
his shift starts ambling past.  Sykes runs in front of it,
waving his badge.  The pickup skids to a stop.

			SYKES
	Police.  Get out.  I need this
	thing.  Out, now!

The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into
gear.  The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have
much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other
traffic.  He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and
pops open the glovebox.  He shoves some maps and garbage
aside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see
what.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Cassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two
alien, one human) through the deserted club.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets
them enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her
lasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter
herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering
her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door.

It is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates
stacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra
powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth.
She struggles until she sees who it is.

			JETSON
	I am here to take Harcourt.  Where
	is he?

She hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a
nod toward the office door.

			CASSANDRA
	In there.

			JETSON
		   (pulling his gun)
	Show me.


INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

The large suitcase rests on the expansive conference
table.  A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens
it.  Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the
viscous blue drug.  Also several of the small, individual
dispensers.  It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in
a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is
flanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.
The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light
and dark.

The two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the
drug.  The human dealer doesn't know what it is.

			HARCOURT
		   (to alien dealers)
	It's been a long time, hasn't it,
	gentlemen?

			HUMAN DEALER
	What is it?

			HARCOURT
	A sweet indulgence from out past...
	resurrected for our future.

Harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien
Dealers' faces... smiles knowingly.  He slides one of the
dispensers from the suitcase.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing; to
		    alien  dealers)
	Please feel free to sample the
	quality.  The experience will be
	everything you remember it to be...

One of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to
his tongue.  The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt--

			ALIEN DEALER
	Where'd you get it?

			HARCOURT
	I arranged to spend some time with
	three very resourceful men.  With a
	certain amount of coaxing, one of
	them was able to reconstitute the
	formula for me.
		   (beat)
	They worked very well together.
	Unfortunately, they are no longer
	with us... but I was fortunate
	enough to reap the benefit of their
	endeavor.

He indicates the drug.  The first alien Dealer sways
gently, enjoying the sensation.  The second alien Dealer
takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over
him.  The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the
dispenser.

			HUMAN DEALER
	Let me try some.
		   (he does,
		    immediately spits
		    it out)
	Jesus!  Tastes like detergent!

			HARCOURT
	And that's all the effect it will
	have on you.  But when my fellow
	Newcomers learn they can obtain it
	here, they will work very hard... to
	make as much money as they can... to
	give it to me.

Suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to
the other office:

			VOICE
	You haven't told him all of it.

Harcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet,
caught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder
holster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer
office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then
steps out himself.  It is Jetson.

Quint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes
go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.

It is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring
to the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's
finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.

			QUINT
	He's got the C-4 charge!

Jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of
him.  He is sweating rivers.  The others quickly join him.
He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he
can see her.

			QUINT
		   (continuing)
	Just take it real casual, buddy.
	Keep your finger on that button and
	don't do nothing squirrely.

			HARCOURT
	If you release that button, you not
	only kill us, but yourself.

			JETSON
	To get you and that--
		   (indicates drug in
		    suitcase)
	-- I would do it.

He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that
Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.

			JETSON
	Everyone up against that wall.
	Very slowly.
		   (to Harcourt)
	Except you.

Harcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where
she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall.
Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.

Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses
it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.
All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.

			HARCOURT
	One small matter seems to have
	escaped your attention.  That--
		   (indicates suitcase)
	-- is not on any books as a
	controlled substance.  Legally it
	might as well be fifty kilos of...
	grape jelly.

			JETSON
	The charge is murder... and
	conspiracy to commit murder.
	Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably
	others.

There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue
eyes.

Cassandra stares at Harcourt.

			CASSANDRA
	You... you killed Strader?

Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
	Where's Todd?!  Did you do something
	to Todd?!

Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.

			HARCOURT
	Todd?  Who is Todd.
		   (then remembers;
		    smiles)
	Ah, poor Mr. Watson.

Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said
sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They
start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357
and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's
face.

			JETSON
	NOOO!

Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He
manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet
going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a
mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead
wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.
Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...
and nothing happens.

			KIPLING
	I got it!

Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the
floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her
with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously
hits her again.

Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling
rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm
-- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over
forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into
Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into
the wall face-first, pinning him there.

			HARCOURT
	Kill them both.

			KIPLING
	Here?

			HARCOURT
		   (raging)
	Do it!

Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the
base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.
There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks
up.

Quint is blown backward away from her.

Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the
Casull smoking in his hand.

Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid
wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He
crashes through it.

ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR

as the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint
cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.

ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE

Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at
Sykes.

Sykes dodges into the private office for cover.

The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.

Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door
leading into the adjoining outer office.

Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door,
straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.
Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,
covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down.

An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and
Kipling escaping, and takes off after them.

Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees
Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He
moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in
surrender, rise from behind the furniture.

			ALIEN DEALER
	Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --
	look!

Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.

			SYKES
	You okay?

			CASSANDRA
		   (dazed, but all
		    right)
	Yeah...

And he charges out the adjoining office door.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson
is ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire
escape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is
HEARD arriving O.S.


EXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT

Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.

Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the
fire escape, find themselves near the unit.

			HARCOURT
	Here!

He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps
in.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear
and floors it.

Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing
car.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the
rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.

			JETSON
	This way!

He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to
it, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls
out.

A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,
heading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.

INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE

Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
SIREN blast on.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic.

Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it
out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.

			JETSON
	Slow traffic on your right... you're
	clear at the left rear...
		   (Sykes changes lanes)
	Careful, red light ahead...

With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the
cross-traffic without incident.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily.

The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the
slug-mobile.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same
juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley.

			JETSON
	Yellow light ahead turning red...

But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it.

			JETSON
		   (continuing; wide-
		    eyed)
	Red light!  Red light!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the
intersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side
of the road, head-on into traffic.

Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police
unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between
them.

Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull
with the other.  He brings it up and around right in front
of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window
at Kipling.

At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.

Jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it.

			JETSON
	Green light, Matthew.
		   (Sykes doesn't
		    respond)
	Green light!

Now Sykes looks.  The light at the intersection has just
turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming.  It's a wall of headlights coming right for
the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Shit!

			JETSON
	Ss-ai!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes locks up the brakes.  Kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away.

Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of
action.  He skids a left onto a side street.


EXT.  SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on.  At the first street available, he cuts
back in behind the police unit.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the
police unit directly above them!  An on-ramp approaches
for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug-
mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a
few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,
cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--


EXT.  SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT

The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street
tunnel.  It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a
pile-up of traffic behind the police unit.

The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--

			SYKES
	Move your goddamned cars!

People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --
ignoring Sykes.  Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around.  He speeds off.


INT./ EXT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT

Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.  Harcourt smiles
with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile
behind them.  Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of
traffic.


EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT

Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian
traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at
Indianapolis.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead.

			JETSON
	There!

Sykes sees it.  Thinking fast, he eases off, using another
car as a blind.  He waits until the police unit is
parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right,
directly for the police unit.

Kipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile
broadsides the police unit.  Sykes forces the police unit
up the off-ramp.


EXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the
right.  The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes
stays right on its ass.  They charge up onto--


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80
MPH.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side
window, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing
past below.


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

A clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.  Sykes
pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the
police unit.  The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,
slowing him down.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Kipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,
then looks back out the front to see the end of the road
coming up fast!  Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on
the brakes.


EXT.  END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends.  An abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence.

With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at
Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The two cars are racing for a full head-on.  At the last
instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile
sideways, passenger side first.  The police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both
cars skidding madly to a stop.  A fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes sits stunned behind the wheel.  Disoriented but
conscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson
out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding.  Then he looks
over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's
hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-
mobile -- near the gas tank.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to
Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars.

He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window.
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase, then starts to run with it.

With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes
clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off
after Harcourt.

Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge.  He heaves the suitcase over, then
starts to climb.

Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit.  Kipling is
still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.  Sykes
is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions.
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge.

Sykes reaches the fence.  Instead of climbing, he simply
blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the
gate.


EXT.  ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT

The end of the bridge is in the "up" position... a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.  Harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.  His
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side.

Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a
prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.

Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --
and has nowhere to go.  He is backed into a corner, with
seawater on two side of him.  Harcourt pivots frantically,
sees Sykes coming this way.  Harcourt is a trapped animal.
His chest heaves in panic.  Then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of
resolve comes into his eye.

ON SYKES

He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
Harcourt is.  There's some movement among the shadows, and
Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against
the trigger.

Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.
A long moment then--

ANGLE - THE SHADOWS

Harcourt emerges from the darkness.  His face is composed,
the superior glint is back in his eye.  His arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in
surrender.

Sykes cat-steps forward slowly.  Harcourt stares at Sykes'
eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an
excuse.  Harcourt simply... smiles.

			SYKES
	Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're
	history...

			HARCOURT
	No, Sergeant -- not history...
		   (beat)
	Eternity...

And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of
the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm.  He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.  His
mouth fills.

He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes
mad, defiant.  And -- he swallows.  Long hold -- then the
wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse.  Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers
the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure.  His limbs hammer
against the deck... his back arches fiercely.  It is a
brutal, agonizing ten seconds.  Then, finally, his body
becomes still.

Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA

Sykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,
and hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand.

ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES

He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he
passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register
that the driver's door of the police unit is now open
before--

-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes
is thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground,
and the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
Kipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes
hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It
connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who
killed Bill Tuggle!

Kipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half-
second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN
ROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes
looks.

ANGLE

Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.

Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the
suitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires
again, and again, and again.

Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase
still over his head... until he is blasted at last and
forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the
inferno.

Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the
alien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire.

HIGH WIDE SHOT

of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two
cops...

				    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's
wagons, fire trucks.  We MOVE through it all to find Sykes
and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.

			JETSON
	With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I
	assume you will be requesting
	reassignment now.

			SYKES
		   (cool)
	It'd be for your own good.  I think
	you'd be better off with a partner
	who's a little more... by the book.
		   (smiles)
	... Still, I gotta tell you, George,
	for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on
	wheels once you get going.  I'd
	kinda hate to miss your next two
	days as a detective.

Jetson smiles.  He glances up as they are bathed in red
and blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them.
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.

			WILTEY
	I'll give you guys a lift to the
	station.  They're waiting to take
	your statements on the shootings.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Let's go, partner.
		   (then casually
		    correcting Wiltey
		    as he rises)
	And it's shooting.  Singular.

			WILTEY
	They said two.

			SYKES
	Nope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he
	o.d.'d.

SHOCK CUT - JETSON

We rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward
Sykes.  His expression tells us his blood has just turned
to ice.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT

ANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward
the DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front.

			DRIVER
	So it's just me and her left in the
	hot tub, right?

			ATTENDANT
	You and the blonde?

			DRIVER
	No, man, the redhead.  The blonde's
	gone in the house with some other
	guy.  But a few minutes later she
	comes back out, alone, when me and
	the redhead are going at it fast and
	furious in the tub, ya know... and
	she sees us, and... she climbs right
	in with us...

			ATTENDANT
	You're full of shit!

			DRIVER
	I swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm
	dyin'...

And, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN
F.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below
FRAME.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

Jetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back,
though he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward
toward the front.  Jetson is intently, nervously scanning
ahead and to both sides.

			JETSON
	You are certain this is the route
	they would have taken?

			WILTEY
	I'm not positive -- but probably.

			SYKES
		   (warily)
	What's this about, George?  I know
	that look.

			JETSON
		   (spots something out
		    a side window)
	There!  Go back.  Down that side
	street.

Wiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

as they approach an eerie scene.  The coroner's wagon is
stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,
headlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the
back doors wide open.  A patrol car is also here, on the
other side of the wagon.  There is no movement anywhere
near the two vehicles.

Wiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the
eerie scene.  He reaches for the radio hand mike.  Jetson
quickly covers it with a large hand.

			JETSON
	No!
		   (both Sykes and
		    Wiltey look at him)
	We must do this alone.

			SYKES
	Do what?!  George-- ?!

Jetson is already sliding out of the car.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns
drawn.  They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's
flashlight, shines it through the open back doors.  The
doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from
end to end.  The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.

Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,
Sykes and Wiltey follow.  Lights all ablaze, it too is
abandoned.  One door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots
something beyond the unit.

			WILTEY
	Oh, God...

Sykes and Jetson look.

The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as
well as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.  Their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead.  Wiltey
stumbles away, backward.

			WILTEY
	I'm calling for back up, now.

			JETSON
	Wiltey, no.

But Wiltey is going.  Jetson starts after him... but Sykes
grabs his arm, hard, and spins him.

			SYKES
	What is this?!

			JETSON
		   (low)
	... It's Harcourt.

			SYKES
	Harcourt is dead.

			JETSON
	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on
	the drug.
		   (searches for the
		    words)
	Massive amounts trigger a... a
	change.  Your body functions seize
	up, you appear to be dead, but it's
	really a state of incubation.  When
	you emerge you're...

			SYKES
		   (looks at the four
		    bodies sprawled
		    before him)
	Tell me about it...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

One minute later.  OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into
CAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted
spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car.  Wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street.  Sykes and Jetson, guns
ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes
everywhere.

MOVING POV

as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching
for any signs of movement.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk.  Their eyes everywhere.

			SYKES
	I never thought I'd say this, but --
	for once in my life I think I'm
	willing to wait for back-up.

			JETSON
	We can't let him get away.

			SYKES
	Why the hell are you so dead set
	against back-up?

			JETSON
		   (a difficult
		    admission)
	Because... because of what will
	happen if humans see what we are
	capable of becoming.

			SYKES
	But there's no more drug.

			JETSON
	You understand that.  But how many
	others will?

Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.

Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead.  Whatever it was,
was large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse
door.

			WILTEY
	There he is!

And Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to
stop him.

			JETSON
	Wiltey!

He and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left,
rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.
Sykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF
BRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

LOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's
stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear
around the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still
running -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling
fumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the
car.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the
car.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We
MOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid
is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE
UP farther, and--

-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting
on the hood of the patrol car.

Sykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body
lies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both
stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the
warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have
done this so fast?

THEIR POV

There are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell.
The sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and
DRIPS of this waterfront building.

ANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON

Jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun
from the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes
checks the Casull.

They exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they
split up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the
right.

WITH JETSON

As he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way
along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled
debris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to
HOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases
open slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the
door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all
the way.  There's nothing inside... now.

Jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is
Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the
warehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Sykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head
as he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.
He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table
and a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to
some local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a
steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite
out of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a
jacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched
on the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight.

Sykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.
He looks around, then continues on.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a
set of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the
stairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the
shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT

Sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging
from the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins
pushing through them.

SYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS

Because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack
of nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through
-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much
farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the
deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the
way he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets
and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--

-- a terrifying face!

ON SYKES

He stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the
Casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.
It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.
The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous
visage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start
his heart again.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Jetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a
door.  He eases it open, enters.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the shadowy confines.  He hears an
incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner.  He moves
to it.  Turns the spigot, stopping the drip.  Other drips
are HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around
him.  He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the
wall above the sink.  Suddenly he sees the movement of
something behind him.  He spins with the shotgun.  A huge
shadow moves along the wall.  He pivots the shotgun again
-- toward the source of the shadow.

It's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the
ceiling.  Jetson lets out a deep breath.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.
A strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.
It makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND.  Sykes
moves along the intersecting hallway.  The CLINKING SOUND
catches his attention.  He stops, listens, then starts
down the passageway, toward us.

He comes forward into the storage room, having to get very
close to the strand of something before he sees what it
is.  It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently
against itself.  Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,
silencing it.  He considers.  It could've been a natural
occurrence... or something could have brushed against it,
setting it in motion.  He tightens his grip on the Casull,
backing away from the chain.  He senses something behind
him and spins.  Nothing there.  He relaxes.  However--

Behind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the
other end of the short passageway.  It is a figure, moving
slowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the
hallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway
as it approaches Sykes.  It stops, inside the room now,
directly behind Sykes.  Close enough to reach out and
touch him.  It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more
powerful.

Suddenly, Sykes senses something is there.  He turns,
slowly, and--

SHOCK CUT - HARCOURT

as he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last
time Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge.  Only this
time it is a horribly transformed Harcourt.  His eyes are
red-rimmed and piggish.  His head is lumpen, his skin
thick and hard.  His neck muscles are corded -- giving him
a kind of hellish cobra's cowl.  There is still
intelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral
intelligence now.

			HARCOURT
		   (his voice a guttural
		    rumble)
	Looking for me, Sergeant?

Sykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the
Casull, and fires.  The powerful Casull round catches
Harcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.


EXT.  WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT

Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing
blast of the Casull.  He gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

Harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact.  The
cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-
burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.
Harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts
toward Sykes.

Scared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires.  One of his shots
misses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head.  The
remaining shots strike Harcourt full on.  Harcourt is
jerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in
anger -- but none of the hits stop him.  The Casull is
empty and Harcourt keeps coming.

Sykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.
Harcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard.  We
HEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates.  Sykes HOLLERS,
and the gun jumps out of his hand.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Jetson races in, shotgun ready.  The last of Sykes' shots
are still ECHOING.  Jetson looks around, frustrated,
unable to tell exactly where they are coming from.  He
sees the likely path and charges that way.


EXT.  DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

On the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,
having been thrown ruthlessly from above.  As Sykes' body
sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs.

Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet.  Harcourt lurches forward
and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him
down the docks.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at
the coroner's wagon.  The Officers leap out, flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost
collapses again.  Harcourt comes at him.  Then Sykes sees
it--

-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties.  Sykes makes a break for it.


EXT.  WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,
frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.  Then, in the
distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty
-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.  Jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the
stairs to help Sykes.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.  The fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty.  Harcourt is fast
behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck.  He yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,
relieved that he has escaped.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes
did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then
onto a second jetty.  And from here, he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the
stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from
above.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,
the sun-gun washing over the docks.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically
waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The
Pilot starts to take it down.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on
his leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws
dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls
away.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the
dock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open
door.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto
the dock.

			JETSON
	On that boat -- out there!

Jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth
of the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back
of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the
bow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey
trapped.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the
channel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the
boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,
looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt
at the stern dinghy.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back
at what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.

			CAPTAIN
	Hey!


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back
against the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the
engines REV loudly.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As
Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the
ratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides
backward into water!


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson watches this happen.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie
line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.

Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already
splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is
sinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward
him.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the
line.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--

-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat!

The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from
the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some
of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes
sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is
on him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy
below.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in
agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt
sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib
cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt
off balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the
first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the
dinghy.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water.  Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's
partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top
of Sykes, and drags him under.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting
to help, knowing he can't.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him.  Sykes shoves it
away, struggling to stay afloat.  His head keeps dunking
under.  He's drowning.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.

			JETSON
	Take it down!  Take it down!


EXT.  WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking
under again.  The helicopter's skids are three feet above
the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	ALL THE WAY!

			PILOT
	I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!

Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but
the skid is just too high.  Jetson has no alternative, and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done.  He moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid.  Hanging on, three feet
above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching
hand.

The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the
two hands meet!  Jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on Sykes' hand.  He starts pulling Sykes up.
When--

HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'
FACE.  His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone.  The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,
breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under
again.

Jetson is frantic.  He keeps waiting -- but this time
Sykes doesn't come up.  Jetson doesn't know what to do.
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot
from the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his
own arm below the surface!  He feels around, gets hold of
something, and pulls.  It is Sykes' wrist.  He pulls hard,
bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	Take it up!

The Pilot does.  Sykes comes up out of the water.  His
feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand
and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.
Sykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving
up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it
falls back into the water below.

Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his
limp arm.  Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,
wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.
The Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they
just pulled Sykes from.

			PILOT
	What the hell was that down there?
	It was weird.

Jetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say.  Sykes
looks at Jetson a long moment, then--

			SYKES
	Looked like every other damn slag to
	me.  Just plain ugly.

Despite the pain, Jetson smiles.

				 LONG DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY

We are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,
trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling.  A
PAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him.  One of
the alien arms is also in a sling.

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson.  Both men wear
tuxedos.

			SYKES
	How do I look?

			JETSON
	You look very good.

There's a knock at the door.  Sykes opens it.  There
stands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking
radiant in her wedding dress.  She is in a foyer, and
behind her is the interior of the church with all the
assembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson & son.

			KRISTIN
	Ready, Daddy...?

Sykes' heart melts.  Before moving to the door:

			SYKES
	George, uh... I want to apologize
	now, in advance, for all the rotten
	things I'll ever say or do to you
	over the years.

Sykes moves to join his daughter.  As he does:

			JETSON
	That is all right, Matthew.  After
	all, you are only human.

Sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	What a wildman...

Sykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start
down the aisle.

				    FADE OUT.

			THE END

3   EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY (NOVEMBER)                                   3

    Bumpy Johnson, an elderly but still sturdy black man,
    elegantly dressed - cashmere overcoat, gloves, Homburg -
    stands in falling snow atop a flatbed truck - as he does
    every Thanksgiving - tossing down turkeys to the poor -
    like a benign king.

    Legend:   Harlem

    A younger man, the gunman from the club - Frank Lucas -
    Bumpy's driver/bodyguard/collector/protege - watches from
    below.

4   INT/EXT. STREET / DISCOUNT EMPORIUM - DAY (NOVEMBER)                  4

    Whispering gunfire from a television set veiled by
    foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in
    1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers:
                            BUMPY O/S
               This is the problem. This is what's
               wrong with America.

    The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with
    price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window.

                            BUMPY O/S
               It's gotten so big you can't find your
               way.

    People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let
    Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.

                            BUMPY
               The corner grocery's a supermarket.
               Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this
               place.

                 Where's the pride of ownership here?
                 Where's the personal service? Does
                 anybody work here?

    Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to
    stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display
    window full of Japanese stereo componentry.

                              BUMPY
                 What right do they have cutting out the
                 suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out,
                 buying direct from the manufacturer -
                 Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks -
                 putting Americans out of work?

    He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.

                              BUMPY
                 What am I supposed to do with a place
                 like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to
                 ask for, the assistant manager?
                        (pause)
                 This is the problem. This is the way it
                 is now: You can't find the heart of
                 anything to stick the knife.

    Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in.
    They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he
    sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.

                               FRANK
                 What is it?

    Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
                              FRANK
                 Somebody call an ambulance!

    But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the
    emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash
    registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of.
    Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -

                              BUMPY
                 Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge.

5   EXT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                        5

    Limousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family,
    friends, celebrities, politicians. Cops on horseback move
    through the enormous crowd that has gathered to watch. FBI
    agents in cars snap pictures with long lenses of Italian
    mobsters like Albert Tosca.

                                                                     (CONT)

    A white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the
    original Superfly - and his entourage. With his trademark

6   INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                     6

    The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here:
    a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem
    gangster, Robin Hood and killer.

                              REPORTER ON TV
                 He was a Great Man, according to the
                 eulogies. A giving man. A man of the
                 people. No one chose to include in their
                 remembrances the word most often
                 associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson:
                 Gangster.

    Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment,
    heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners
    circling the place like vultures:

    Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and
    tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present
    coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian
    capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.

                              TOSCA
                 White wine, please.

    A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down
    next to Frank.

                              BANKER
                 How you doing, Frank?

                              FRANK
                 All right.

                              BANKER
                 What a loss.

    Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking
    about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery
    glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.

                              BANKER
                 Bumpy set something up for you?

    Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where
    Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.

                              TANGO
                 Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while
                 you're at it.

    Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his
    jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He
    takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens
    a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango -
    who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.

                              CHARLIE
                 I know you're hurting, Frank.    So am I.

    Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope
    man.

                              CHARLIE
                 You going to be all right?

                             FRANK
                 Yeah.

                              CHARLIE
                 I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he
                 made me promise, anything ever happened
                 to him, I'd make sure you didn't go
                 without.

                              FRANK
                 I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people
                 here owed Bumpy money when he died. A
                 lot of money. If they think I'm going
                 to forget to collect, they're wrong.

                              CHARLIE
                 That's the spirit. Go get them.

    On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime
    figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered
    that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."

     A figure, his back to us, walks slowly toward a blackboard
     like a man to the gallows.

     Harlem's jagged teeth skyline juts across the river at the
     other end of the George Washington Bridge. On this side - a
     sledgehammer gripped in Richie's fist, on the move, suddenly
     fills the frame.

                             RICHIE                                           
                You know the Number 1 fear of most                            
                people isn't dying; it's public speaking.                     
                They get physically ill. They throw up.

                I don't like being like that.     I want to                   
                beat it.

     Armed with the sledgehammer, Richie and his partner - Javy               
     Rivera - come past a seedy motel office where a TV shows                 
     another report about Bumpy Johnson.

     Legend:   New Jersey

     A motel clerk looks up, glimpses the sledgehammer -

                              CLERK
                 Hey -

    Rivera flashes a New Jersey detective's shield without                   
    breaking stride. Takes a subpoena out of another pocket.                 

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Who's going to do this?                                     

                              RICHIE
                 He knows me, he'll take it from me.                         
                 I've known him since high school.                           

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Just throw it in, he doesn't take it.                       
                 That's good service.                                        

    They reach a particular motel room door. Rivera knocks.                  
    The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy
    in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to               
    close the door -                                                         

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Throw it -                                                  

    As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his                  
    hand. He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears                
    the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth              
    bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame.             

                              RIVERA

    Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings               
    past his head shattering the door -                                      

8   INT/EXT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   8

    The door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in.
    The wise guy - Campizi - hurries for the bathroom, slams the             
    door. This one's hollow and the detectives more easily                   
    break through it -                                                       

    Campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window. Richie                   
    grabs him, throws him into the shower stall, taking the
    plastic curtain down with them, smearing it with blood as
    Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off.

                               CAMPIZI
                  I swear to God, Richie, I didn't know it
                  was you. I would never slam a door on
                  your hand. Knowingly.

                               RICHIE
                  You bit my fuckin hand -

     Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand -
     which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi. The
     paramedics manage to pull him away.

                               CAMPIZI
                  What can we do, Richie? You don't want
                  to do this. For old times sake, what can
                  we do? Who do you want? Who can I give
                  you? You want Big Sal's bookie? You want
                  his accountant? I'll give him to you.

     Richie regards him a moment. A policy ring's accountant
     wouldn't be bad. He glances back to his paramedic dabbing
     at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking. She
     smiles back.

     Four men in long black leather coats stride toward like
     they own the city. It's impossible to tell if they're cops
     or gangsters.

     Legend:   New York City

11   INT. NEW YORK POLICE ANNEX - PROPERTY ROOM - DAY                 11
     One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo -
     scribbles a signature and badge number different from the
     one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting
     evidence needed in court.

     He pushes the voucher under a sign - "All Handguns and
     Narcotics Before 10am Next Window" - to a clerk who takes it
     past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic
     bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts.
     Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie
     unwrapped with dangling tags.

     The clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable
     items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks
     the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase.

                                                                          8.

          Trupo's car - a Shelby Mustang - roars up. He climbs out,
          crosses to a warehouse with the suitcase as the other three
          SIU Princes of the City follow from another car, cradling
          grocery bags.

          Trupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags
          of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags. The other cops pull
          from the grocery bags: a Pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter,
          boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale,
          and yellow baggies.

          Hands peel back the distinctive black and green "evidence"
          tape on the clear plastic bags. Dump the heroin into twenty
          yellow baggies. A half-kilo of lactose is poured into each
          of the now-empty property room bags.

                                 TRUPO
                    Now just enough for the reagent test.

          He removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the
          baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed
          through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags,
          the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase.

          been arranged on   an evidence table with the care of a Macy's

          Shelby with a sports bag, crosses to the Lincoln, climbs in

          the bag revealing the recut heroin - in the yellow plastic.

                    Who can live like that? There has to
                    be order. That would never happen with
                    Italians. More important than any one
                    man's life - is order.

       A street sign on a corner:        116th and 8th Avenue.

       As is his custom, Frank eats breakfast alone. A middle-
       aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate
       and refills his coffee.

                                 FRANK
                    Thank you, Charlene.      Last one.

                                 CHARLENE
                    It's all right with me, Frank, you can
                    stay all day if you want, but I wouldn't.
                    It's nice outside.

                                 FRANK
                    Then maybe I'll have to go for a walk.
                    Just cause you said so.

       She smiles and leaves. Frank pours some sugar in his
       coffee. Someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees
       two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes.

21     INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                              21
       Frank leads the servicemen up the stairs of a building.

22     INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       22

       Corner apartment above the street. A girl sits smoking at
       a work table covered with drug-cutting apparatus. Another -
       Frank's cutter and sometimes-girlfriend, Red Top - sets a
       couple of packets of heroin in front of the servicemen.

                                 RED TOP
                    On the house for our men in uniform.

                                 SERVICEMAN 1
                    Why, thank you, sugar, that's very kind.

                                   RED TOP
                    Thank Frank.

          Frank nods, you're welcome before the man can thank him.
          The servicemen start cooking up the dope.

                                     FRANK
                       How's Nate?   You seen him?

                       All the time. Nate is everywhere.
                       He's good. Got himself a club now.

                       I don't think he's ever coming home.

          Regarding the dope as the servicemen shoot it up -

24        EXT. SOCIAL CLUB - NEWARK - LATE AFTERNOON                         24

          Across the river, Richie, Rivera and Campizi sit in the car             
          parked across from a closed social club. A man carrying a
          grocery bag comes out and Campizi ducks lower in the seat.

                                     CAMPIZI
                       That's him.

          Newsboy Moriarty's mob accountant puts the grocery bag in
          the trunk of a car, climbs in behind the wheel.

25        EXT. NEWARK - SCRAP METAL YARD - LATE AFTERNOON                    25

          From the parked car they observe the accountant putting
          another bag in his trunk.

                                                                  12.

     He comes out of another place with another bag.       To Campizi -

                             RICHIE
               All right.   Get lost.    Get out.

     Campizi slinks out of the car. Richie and Rivera follow               
     after Newsboy Moriarty's accountant's car.

27   EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON                              27

     They tail the car into a lot, park and watch the accountant
     leave his car and get into another car that's parked there.

                            RIVERA                                         
               We gonna stay with him or the car?

     Whatever they do, they'll have to decide quick.

                            RICHIE
               Let's see who comes for the car.

28   EXT. PARKING LOT - NEWARK - NIGHT                              28

     All the other cars are gone. Rivera climbs into Richie's              
     with coffee and a Coke in a bag, hands him the can.                   

                            RIVERA                                         
               Think he made us?

     Richie doesn't know. Glances at his watch.      Cranes in his
     seat to look behind them.
                            RICHIE
               You called for the warrant?     Where are
               they?

                            RIVERA                                         
               I just called. I called and walked back
               here and ten seconds has gone by.

     Richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street
     lamps buzz, grows impatient. Indicating the other car:

                            RICHIE
               We saw him with the slips, Javy.

     Richie isn't kidding. Rivera stares at him like he's crazy.               
     Richie checks his watch. He's waited long enough.

     Richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and
     bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the

     passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as
     he comes around back to search it -

     Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one           
     anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under
     the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely -

     Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside.
     Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of           
     it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more          
     than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes -

30   INT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - LATER - NIGHT                    30

     As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback,
     Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his
     night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where
     Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly:                    

                            TOBACK
               How much.

                            RICHIE
               Nine hundred and eighty thousand.

                            TOBACK
               What happened to the rest?

     It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards
     his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place -
     who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback
     walks over to the captain, and, quietly:

                            TOBACK
               What're you doing counting this in front                   
               of everybody? Are you out of your fuckin
               mind? Take it into a room. Now.

     Richie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked.          

31   INT/EXT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - PRE-DAWN                     31

     As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him -
     knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect,
     but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will           
     ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off.
32   INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY                                     32

     Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table
     where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.

                            TANGO
               Didn't you see the jar, Frank?
               I think you walked right past it.

     Frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats.    Tango sits.

                            TANGO
               The money jar. On the corner.      What I
               got to do, put a sign on it?

     Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't
     full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his
     coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango.
                                                                 (CONT)

                               TANGO
                  Bumpy don't own 116th Street no more,
                  Frank. Bumpy don't own no real estate in
                  Harlem no more. I'm the landlord now and
                  the lease is twenty-percent.

     Frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look
     that says that won't be happening.

                               TANGO
                  Then don't sell dope, Frank. Get a
                  fuckin job. You need a job? You can be
                  my driver, drive me around, open my door,
                  yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right
                  away, Massa Johnson, sir.

     Right now Tango is dead. No doubt about it.          On the
     surface, though, Frank remains cool.

                               FRANK
                  Twenty percent?

                               TANGO
                  Of every dollar. Every VIG, every
                  truckload, every girl, every ounce.      In
                  the jar.

                               FRANK
                  Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm
                  giving it to you then what am I doing?
                  Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you
                  know, out of business, which puts you out
                  of business.
                         (reaches for his breakfast
                          check)
                  There are ways to make money
                  legitimately, and then there's this way.
                  Not even Bumpy took twenty percent.

                               TANGO
                  Bumpy's fuckin dead.

     Frank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money
     clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a
     $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango.

                                FRANK
                  There.   That's twenty-percent.

     As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ...

                                                                 17.

     Stitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a
     pot, put it on the stove.

34   INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT                     34     

     A pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures. But
     no matter how many times Frank does the arithmetic, there's
     not much left, he calculates, after he pays the Italian
     suppliers and, if he were to, Tango.

35   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED                   35     

     Richie has moved to a small desk cluttered with law
     textbooks. He cracks one open to study for the New Jersey            
     Bar exam as he eats the soup out of the pot he heated it in.         
     Above him on the wall is a framed photograph of Joe Louis            
     standing over a sprawled-on-the-mat Billy Conn.                      

36   EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - INTERCUT                    36

     A bleak day. Seagulls fighting over scraps on the sand as
     others hover overhead, flapping and cawing. Alone near the
     water, Frank tosses a stick for the German shepherd he
     inherited.

37   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT                    37     

     Richie opens a small wooden box in his bleak apartment,
     revealing an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers and clips.
     As he rolls a joint -

                            BUMPY V/O
               A leader is like a shepherd -

38   EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - CONTINUED                   38

     The sounds of the gulls and surf and roller coaster begin to
     fade as Frank throws the stick again.

                            BUMPY V/O
               Sends the fast nimble sheep out front,
               and the others follow as the shepherd
               walks quietly behind -

     The dog retrieves the stick, but this time - somehow - it's
     to Bumpy's hand he returns it. Frank listens attentively.

                            BUMPY
               He's got the stick - the cane - and
               he'll use if he has to.

                  But most of the time he doesn't have to.
                  He moves the whole herd - quietly.

     Bumpy smiles and tosses the stick.

39   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT                       39   

     The smoke from the joint rises to the ceiling as Richie               
     studies.                                                              

40   EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - CONTINUED                      40

     The dog trots back to Bumpy and Frank with the stick.

41   EXT. BOARDWALK - CONEY ISLAND - LATER                            41

     Hot dog stand. Bumpy hands a hot dog to Frank, holds out
     another to the shepherd. To camera:

                               BUMPY
                  What right do they have cutting out the
                  suppliers, the middlemen, buying direct,
                  putting Americans out of work ... This
                  is the way it is now, Frank.

     Frank nods. The vender hands him a napkin. The shepherd
     is still with him, but Bumpy is gone, and the gulls and the
     people on the roller coaster squeal as Frank comes out of
     his meditative trance with an idea.

     A needle pierces the crook of Frank's arm.       Slight grimace.
     A cotton ball is pushed onto the puncture.       Malaria shot.
43   CLOSE-UP: (PHOTOGRAPHY SHOP)                                     43

     A strobe lights up Frank's face:      a passport photo.

44   CLOSE-UP: (POST OFFICE)                                          44

     The photo and a duplicate are stapled to a passport
     application.

     Keys turn the locks of a safety-deposit box. The lid lifts
     revealing decks of cash. Frank takes it all out, slips one
     slender packet into Bumpy's banker's jacket pocket.

                               FRANK
                  Get yourself a new suit.

        The sound of the plane growls and fades overhead as Richie's
        ex-wife keeps an eye on their son playing on a grassy area.

                                RICHIE
                  I'm sorry.

                               LAURIE
                  I don't know, Richie.

                               RICHIE
                  It couldn't be avoided. Next weekend
                  I'll be able to take him.

        She regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at
        one of the other - better-looking - moms in the park.

                                LAURIE
                  I'm moving.

        He looks back, not sure he heard right.

                  What?   Where?

        He glances away to a sound: shattering glass.        Some teen-
        agers breaking bottles on the ground.

                               RICHIE
                  You can't move to Vegas.     Not with
                  Michael anyway.

     The teenagers ignore him. He tries to ignore them, but it's
     hard with the constant noise.

                               RICHIE
                  No court will allow it for one thing.
                  I won't allow it.

     Their son glances over at them. Richie looks over at the
     teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to Laurie.

     The noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides
     over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you
     gonna do, old man, it's four against one.

                               RICHIE

     others. All instinctively try to cover their heads.

        The clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R
        and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern
        blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come
        out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place.

        Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or
        stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys
        the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope
        being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase.

        His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the
        tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some,
        his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder.

        The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching
        Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through
        the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in
        a kind of shock, more to himself -
                                 NATE
                     Frank - ?

        Frank half-lifts his glass to wave, and Nate beams.

        Frank has guests at his table now: his cousin Nate the
        Sergeant, and two young Asian wise guys. They talk about
        him in Thai (subtitled):

                     He say how much he wants?

                     He said "a lot." What that means, I
                     don't know. Four or five keys?

     The Thais regard Frank a moment, size him up.

                               THAI
                  He's your cousin.

                               NATE
                  My cousin-in-law.    My ex-wife's cousin.

                               THAI
                  Ask him how much he wants.

                               NATE
                  How much you gonna want, Frank?

                               FRANK
                  A hundred kilos.

     Nate blinks like there's something in his eye ...

55   EXT. BANGKOK - STREET VENDER - DAY                               55

     Steam and neon.    Frank and Nate at a crowded stand.

                               NATE
                  No one I know can get that much. It'd
                  have to be pieced together from several
                  suppliers and none of it's gonna be 100-
                  percent pure.

                               FRANK
                  That's not what I want.

                               NATE
                  I know that. But that means dealing
                  with the Chiu-Chou syndicates in Cholon
                  or Saigon - if they'll deal with you -

                               FRANK
                  No, even then it's too late. It's been
                  chopped. I want to get it where they get
                  it. From the source.

     Nate stares at him ... then laughs.       Frank doesn't.

                               NATE
                  You're gonna go get it.

                              FRANK
                  Why not.

       A room of student-type desks and no character. Richie,                
       and fifty others, have been here for hours taking the exam            
       less than half of them will pass.                                     

A56    EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                               A56

       A motley bunch of Thai thugs and black American soldiers
       with automatic weapons ride mules through the dense jungle
       with Nate and Frank, who - armed with a pistol, a rifle and
       ammo bandolier like Pancho Villa - is enjoying himself.
       From his POV, the jungle canopy suddenly opens up on a poppy
       field the size of Manhattan. Frank stares down at it.

B56    EXT. JUNGLE RISE / OPIUM FARM - DAY                             B56

       On the ground now with their small private army, Nate speaks
       with one of the Thais, then translates for Frank.

                                 NATE
                    He says this whole area's controlled
                    by the Kuomintang - Chiang Kai-Shek's
                    defeated army.

       Some of whom they can see down below on the opium farm -
       Chinese soldiers with outdated weapons. Frank tips his head
       to Nate at some other figures below -

                                 FRANK
                    They ain't Chinese.

       A handful of better-armed American sentries at the perimeter
       of the farm. CIA. Frank, Nate and the others hang back as
       one of the Thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas.

C56    EXT. OPIUM FARM - LATER                                         C56

       The processing center for the entire region. The Thai
       translator is with Frank to negotiate with a vanquished
       Chinese general. Other Americans and Thais guard them
       while the Chinese with their CIA advisors guard them.

                                                                   24.
                            




D56   INT. BAMBOO DWELLING - LATER - DAY                            D56

      The Chinese general examines Frank's papers - passport,
      visa, bank receipts - and lots of cash - then studies Frank.

                             GENERAL
                How would you get it into the States?

                             FRANK
                What do you care?

                             GENERAL
                Who do you work for in there?

                             FRANK
                What do you care?

                             GENERAL
                Who are you really?

                             FRANK
                It says right there.   Frank Lucas.

                             GENERAL
                I mean, who you represent?

                             FRANK
                Me.

      The man doesn't believe it, but lets it go.

                             GENERAL
                You think you're going to take a hundred
                kilos of heroin into the US and you don't
                work for anyone? Someone is going to
                allow that?

      Frank shrugs. The general regards one of his men.       In
      Chinese, subtitled:

                             GENERAL
                I don't believe a word of this.

      The general regards the cash and paperwork again for a
      moment. And, to Frank:

                             GENERAL
                After this first purchase, if you're not
                killed by Marseilles importers - or their
                people in the States - then what?

                   Then there'd be more. On a regular basis.
                   Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass
                   all the way up here every time.

      The man regards Frank for a long moment.       Glances back to
      the cash and paperwork again. Finally -

                                GENERAL
                   Of course not.

E56   EXT. JUNGLE ARMY LZ - VIETNAM - DAY                             E56

      Torrential monsoon rains. Dripping camouflage. Nate and
      Frank climb down from the Huey. Frank no longer wears the
      bandolier. Now a press card dangles from his neck.

      Stripes on the uniform of a black colonel with Nate under a
      canopy. Outside, in the distance, in the rain, Frank hangs
      out with some other black servicemen.

      Nate and Frank watch the colonel emerge from the tent and
      cross through the rain on duck-boards to another tent to
      speak with a white officer, a 2-star general.

                                NATE
                   Fifty grand. In advance. That'll
                   cover them, the pilots and the guys on
                   the other end.

                                FRANK
                   Give them a hundred.

                   A hundred. And it's all I got left. So
                   if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever
                   reason -
                          (embraces Nate and whispers)
                   Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down.

      He holds out a business envelope fat with money. Nate
      hesitates, knowing Frank has just said he'll kill him if
      things don't go right, then takes it.

                                NATE
                   I'll let you know when it's in the air.

      The nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's
      bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the
      cops. The phone rings. And won't stop. Neither will the

      Richie can hear in Sander's voice how serious it is and
      manages to disentangle himself from the woman.

                   need back-up.

                                DISPATCHER

57    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            57

      As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects -
      the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark
      30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago
      torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument.

      He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past
      an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive
      heat. It's riot weather.

      Dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him.           Richie       
      throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him.                            

                                PARAMEDIC
                   You got no back-up? Why is that?                             

      The only other person who would know the answer to that is
      Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair.                              

                                RICHIE
                   Bandage his head.

                                PARAMEDIC
                   Detective ... he's dead.

                                RICHIE
                   I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his
                   head, clean him up, put him on a gurney
                   and prop it up so he's sitting. And open
                   his eyes.

59    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                              59

      Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like
      it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at
      the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance.

                                RICHIE
                   Step back, injured man coming out. Let
                   them do their job and he'll be all right.
                   Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir.
                   Please.

      The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney:
      tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they
      can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls
      out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away -                     

A60   EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                  A60

      They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera                  
      finally breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 RIVERA                                         
                   Thank you -

      The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him                
      up against a car.

      Richie rips Rivera's jacket pockets.        Money spills out.

                   No, it isn't. It's part of the salary
                   for getting shot at. For that, certain
                   courtesies are shown. In gratitude -                         

      Richie, disgusted with him, lets go of him.         Rivera is             
      embarrassed, almost crying, pleading -

        Rivera suddenly tries to get tough -                                    

                                  RIVERA

                     make that kind of accusation against your
                     own kind. And you know why.

        He takes out his car keys, turns to leave. Comes past                   
        Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a            
        line of puncture scabs and scars.

                                  RICHIE
                     You're a disgrace.

                     You know who'll work with me after that?
                     Same as you. No one.

        Richie squeezes Rivera's hand around the car key.                       

                                  RICHIE
                     Don't look down there. Look here.

                     You ever fuckin threaten me again, I'll
                     kill you.

        Richie squeezes Sander's hand so hard the car key cuts
        through the skin, drawing blood.

        Silence. Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a
        perimeter fence. Frank waits by the car as a military Jeep
        with its lights out comes across a firing range. It slows,
        stops. In it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black,
        armed with M-16's. Silence again, before:

                                  ARMY CAPTAIN
                     Open the trunk.

        Frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen
        drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the Jeep to his
        car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut.

        The duffel bags, still closed, on a table. Frank regards
        them, nursing a drink, putting off the moment of discovery
        that he has perhaps spent his life's savings on nothing.
                                                                       (CONT)

      The German shepherd watches as Frank removes the tape from
      one of the bags. He pulls it open - has almost no reaction -
      except to breathe again - then opens the next, and the next.

      And we see: Several brick-like packages of No. 4 heroin
      wrapped in paper marked with Chinese writing, stamped with
      a label: two lions on their hind legs, paws on a globe,
      and, in English: DOUBLE UOGLOBE BRAND 100%.

      The duffel bags are elsewhere. The only evidence of any
      drugs is the small amount Frank has given a chemist - who
      looks like a Harvard student - to test. It responds                     
      instantly. The young man looks at Frank.                                

                                CHEMIST
                   Typically what I see is 25 to 45                           
                   percent pure. I've never seen anything                     
                   like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants,                   
                   no dilutents. It's a hundred percent.                      
                   May I?                                                     

      The chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up,             
      but Frank gives him some to take home instead.

                   Take it with you. I don't want to have                     
                   to call the coroner.                                       

      The chemist gathers his things to leave, offering a last                
      piece of advice -

      framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes.

      Dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts
      like patches of rusty snow. Crickets and bullfrogs. From a
      mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with
      a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. The kid's got a
      major league arm.

     Divorced couples in custody battles wait with their                       
     attorneys in a packed courthouse. An lawyer carrying papers               
     clipped with a $10 bill, comes past Richie, who's sitting                 
     with his lawyer, a woman he's probably slept with.

74   EXT. HOUSE - TEANECK, NEW JERSEY - DAY                             74

     Frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house.
     His neighbors - those he can see - are white. He hears a
     sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where
     a sold "For Sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel.

     Out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North
     Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just
     arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here,
     the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives
     and kids, and their mother.

     Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as
     sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar
     parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for
     trespassing.
     The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his
     dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each
     of his startled brothers.

75   INT. FRANK'S TEANECK HOUSE - LATER - DAY                           75

     The house is alive with the noise of family and scent of
     home-cooked food as the extended Lucas clan - there's more
     than twenty of them - sits around a big dining room table
     passing the platters around. Frank, at the head of the
     table, clearly loves having them all here.

                               TURNER
                  He got an arm on him.     Major League arm,
                  ain't that right.

     Everyone agrees as Turner's son - Frank's nephew - the 18-
     year-old boy seen pitching in the North Carolina back yard -
     tries to shrug.

                  You can't catch him. He'll take your
                  head off. We're talking 95-mile-an-hour.
                  You know how fast that is? You see the
                  ball leave his hand, and that's the last
                  you see it before it knocks you down.

76   INT. FRANK'S TEANECK HOUSE - LATER - DAY                           76

     The wonderful noise continues downstairs as Frank leads his
     mother on a tour of the upstairs. The place is a showroom
     of traditional Americana.

                               FRANK
                  This is your room.

     Mrs. Lucas is   in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its
     furnishings.    It's unlike anything she's used ever seen -
     not Graceland   exactly - but not far off. Her eyes settle on
     an old vanity   dotted with French perfume bottles.

                               MRS. LUCAS
                  How did you ...

                               FRANK
                  I had it made. From memory.
                               MRS. LUCAS
                  You were five when they took it away.
                  How could you remember it?

                                FRANK
                  I remember.

     She's stunned. Touches the reproduction of the vanity her
     son last saw more than thirty years ago.

                               MRS. LUCAS
                  It's perfect.
                         (looks at the room)
                  It's all perfect.
                         (she looks at him)
                  I'm so proud of you.

     As Frank leads his brothers down the sidewalk, the Towncar
     that was parked at the Teaneck house, driven by Frank's body-
     guard, Doc, follows alongside at the same pace they walk.

                            FRANK
               I was with him every day for fifteen of
               them, looking after him, taking care of
               things, protecting him, learning from
               him.

     The brothers can't help but notice the storekeepers who wave
     to Frank, the women who smile, the men who step out of his
     path like there's a red carpet under his polished shoes.

                            FRANK
               Bumpy was rich, but never white   man rich.
               Why? Because he didn't own the    company.
               He thought he did. He didn't.     He only
               managed it. Someone else owned    it. So
               they owned him.

               company.

80   INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY                        80

     Five naked women at work tables, their faces veiled by
     surgical masks, cutting heroin with lactose and quinine in a
     precise mixture of controlled purity. The Lucas brothers
     stare as the supervisor of the activity - clothed, with red
     hair - comes over.

                               REDTOP

     Tango strolls down the street like he's the Godfather of
     Harlem, girl on his arm, bodyguard at his side.

82   INT. DINER - SAME TIME                                            82

     As his brothers eat lunch, Frank - who can see Tango outside
     - uncaps a glass sugar container.

                               FRANK
                  What matters in business is honesty,
                  integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never
                  forgetting where you came from.

     For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all
     sugar from the container onto his plate.
                               FRANK
                  You are what you are and that's one of
                  two things. You're nothing ... or you're
                  something. Understand what I'm saying?

     The brothers nod tentatively, stare at the now-empty glass
     container. Frank wipes his mouth with a napkin, gets up.

                               FRANK
                  I'll be right back.

     He comes out of the diner, crosses the street toward Tango,
     who's buying fruit. Greets him cheerfully -

                  Hey, Tango, what's up.    I was just

                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                  I was looking at the jar and you know
                  what? I didn't    see nothing in it.

                               TANGO
                  The fuck you want, Frank -

     Before the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a
     gun pressed against his forehead. Silence. Everyone backs
     away - the bodyguard, too. Tango's girl pulls her arm from
     his and takes off. Eventually -

                               TANGO
                  What're you going to do, boy? Shoot me
                  in broad daylight? In front of everyone?

     It's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves;
     everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants.
     As Tango laughs at the thought -

                               FRANK
                  Yeah, that's right.

     Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like
     someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties
     the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street.

     Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but
     Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's
     suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops
     it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.

                               FRANK
                  For the cops. Should be enough.

     Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the
     astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the
     place. Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he
     tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar.

                               FRANK
                  That basically's the whole picture right

     A cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not Tango - but
     Rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and                
     toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict.

                  Beth.

     The medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer
     containing her body. Richie stares at it.

                               DETECTIVE
                  Should've seen their place.    Like animals
                  lived there.

                               RICHIE
                  I have seen it.

                               DETECTIVE

                  Chose a good night, huh?   Grand Central
                  Station in here.

                               MEDICAL EXAMINER
                  It's been like this. I'm lucky I get
                  home before midnight; lots of careless-
                  ness.

     Richie regards Rivera's personal effects resting on his                 
     chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the Corvette key, a half-
     empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. Richie takes the
     blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes
     entombing Sanders, holds it in his hand ...

                  Heroin addiction is no longer exclusive
                  to big city neighborhoods; it's epidemic -

     The reports shows lawmakers on Capitol Hill juxtaposed
     against images of inner-cities, junkies, homicide victims
     and, perhaps most telling, white suburbia.

                               REPORTER ON TV
                  Since 1965, law enforcement has watched
                  its steady increase and with it a rise in
                  violent crime. Now unaccountably, it has
                  exploded, reaching into cities as a whole
                  - our suburbs and towns - our schools.

     INT. POLICE GYM - DAY

     The TV is in a small police gym where Richie lifts weights,
     very much aware of his pariah status as out-of-shape cops               
     come in, only to leave again when they see him.


                                                                    (CONT)

                  Someone is finally saying: enough.
                  Federal authorities have announced their
                  intention to establish special narcotics
                  bureaus in Washington, New York, Los
                  Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Newark and
                  other major cities -

     Toback comes in, watches Richie, alone, working out.

     Richie's changing into his street clothes.

                               RICHIE
                  But it's federal. I'd have to answer
                  to who? FBI?

                               TOBACK
                  Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else.
                  No FBI. Hoover knows better than to mix
                  his men with dope. Too much temptation
                  for the feeble-minded.

     Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the
     assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea.
     Toback levels with him -
                               TOBACK
                  Richie, a detective who doesn't have
                  the cooperation of his fellow detectives
                  can't be effective.

                               RICHIE
                  You know why I don't have it.

                               TOBACK
                  Doesn't matter.

                               RICHIE
                  No, they're all on the take and I'm not                    
                  and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead
                  of giving you a medal for turning in
                  money, they bury you.

                  this's an opportunity away from all that.                  

     They regard each other.    Eventually -

                  I'll do it, but only like this: I
                  don't set foot in a police station again.
                  I work out of a place of my own. And I
                  pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't
                  take a nickel off the sidewalk.

88   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY                           88

     The place has been long abandoned. The city maintenance

     strewn church.

     rope outside the club. The Apollo in the background: James
     Brown on the marquee.

95   INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT                                    95

     A still-powerful older man in a nice suit rises from his
     chair to wild applause. From the stage -

                               SINGER
                  Mr. Joe Louis, ladies and gentlemen.

     Joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, and
     sits back down as the band starts up again.

     At another table, Frank sits with Charlie Williams and
     Rossi, slightly older dope men. Like Frank, they favor
     expensive tailored suits. Their dates, too, are nicely
     dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. Frank's glance
     moves from Joe Louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman
     at the table.

                               FRANK
                  Who's the beauty queen?

                  She is a beauty queen.    No kidding.
                  Miss Puerto Rico.
     Her glance crosses Frank's briefly but is yanked to the
     entrance of the club when Frank's brothers come in with
     their wives and girlfriends. Teddy's in a parrot green
     suit, gold chains, hat, acting like he owns the place.

     He turns Teddy so he's facing a mirror.

                  Those -
                         (Teddy's in the mirror)
                  - are a costume. With a sign on it that
                  says Arrest me. You look like fuckin
                  Jackie Fox.

                               TEDDY
                  What's wrong with Jackie.    I like Jackie.

                               FRANK
                  You like Jackie? You want to be
                  Superfly? Go work for him, end up in a
                  cell with him.

     Teddy pulls himself from Frank's grasp. Smooths his shirt,
     adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him:

                               FRANK
                  The guy making all the noise in the room
                  is the weak one. That's not who you want
                  to be.

                               TEDDY
                  He wants to talk to you by the way.     I
                  told him I'd tell you.

     Frank stares at his brother's reflection in the mirror.

                               FRANK
                  You and Jackie were talking about me?

                               TEDDY
                  Not about you. We were talking. He said
                  he wanted to talk to you about something.

     Frank clearly wants nothing to do with Jackie Fox.

                               FRANK
                  I'm taking you shopping tomorrow.

98   INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        98

     Joe Louis has come over to speak to Frank at his table.

                               JOE LOUIS
                  It's a tax thing. It's a mistake my
                  lawyers will straighten out, but for the
                  time being it's a headache -

                               JOE LOUIS
                  It's nothing, like - fifty grand.

     Frank isn't sure if it's an honor or a curse to have a
     celebrity like Joe Louis asking to borrow money, but nods.

                                FRANK
                  Sure.   Don't worry about it.

                                JOE LOUIS
                  Thank you.   I'll pay you back soon as -

                  Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan.       You
                  don't owe me nothing.

     Jackie glides into the club with his magazines and
     entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at
     Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he
     should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to
     Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a
     sentry. Frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. Doc
     knows the look. Gets up.

                                FRANK
                   Because I don't have to.

      He smiles, and it's hard to tell which is more enchanted
      with the other.

100   INT. NIGHTCLUB - NEWARK - SAME TIME - NIGHT                     100

      A club across the river. Not nearly as nice as Small's -
      much louder - but like Small's, almost all black. Richie
      shares a booth with a black undercover detective.

                                RICHIE
                   I'm reluctant to bring anyone in I
                   don't personally know.

                                SPEARMAN
                   You know me, and I vouch for them.

      Richie nods, Yeah, he knows that, but remains unconvinced.

                                SPEARMAN
                   Richie, we work together. You want me,
                   you got to take them, too.

                                RICHIE
                   Where are they?
      Spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor.

                                SPEARMAN
                   That's Jones. With the skinny white
                   woman.

      Richie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with
      his skinny white date.

                                SPEARMAN
                   That's Abruzzo, with the fat black one.

      Richie sees a young Italian with tatoos - the only other
      white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman.
      Both Jones and Abruzzo look more like criminals than cops.

                   Both are good with wires. Have good
                   informants. They're honest. And they're
                   fearless. They'll do anything. They're
                   insane, Richie, like you.

101   INT. FRANK'S CAR - MOVING - NEW YORK - DAY                       101

      Frank sits in back alone. Peers ahead through the
      windshield. His face relaxes as he sees -

102   EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY                                             102

      Ana waiting on a corner, dressed nice, handbag.         The Towncar
      pulls to the curb.

                                FRANK
                   I got it.

      Frank gets out before Doc can, and escorts Ana to the car.

                                FRANK
                   I hope you weren't waiting long. A
                   woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have
                   to wait for anything.

      He opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman, slides
      in after her.

                   This is your father?

      Frank shakes his head no.       It's a picture of Bumpy.

                                FRANK
                   You really don't know who that is?
                          (she doesn't)
                   It's Martin Luther King.

                                ANA
                   It is not.

                                FRANK
                   You're right. He was as important as Dr.
                   King, though.

                   What'd he do?

                                FRANK
                   A lot of things. He had a lot of
                   friends. He served New York and it
                   served him.

                                ANA
                   What was he to you?

      Frank has to think.     Bumpy was more than his employer.

                                FRANK
                   Teacher.

                                ANA
                   What'd he teach you?

                   How to take my time ... how if you're
                   going to do something, do it with care
                   ... do it with love.

      And it's working here.     It's seductive.

      The same calm, benign face in the photograph.        Frank nods.

                   How be a gentleman.

      Ana smiles like she knows better. Any second now, like
      every other guy she's ever met, she's sure he'll try to take
      her upstairs.

                                FRANK
                   I got five different apartments in the

106        INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY                          106

           A single, half-empty packet of heroin, the same one from the
           morgue, in distinctive blue cellophane, tacked to a bulletin
           board. Richie, perched on a desk in front of it.

                                     RICHIE
                        Our mandate is to make major arrests.
                        No street guys - we want the suppliers -
                        the distributors.

           Spearman, Jones and Abruzzo sit in the back, looking like
           delinquent students. Of everyone in the open ground-floor
           that's been only slightly renovated - and there are about
           fifteen of them - they're the most disreputable-looking.

                                     RICHIE
                        Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No
                        grass under a thousand pounds. Less than                   
                        that, someone else can waste their time.

           Jones nudges Abruzzo to pay attention. Abruzzo elbows him
           back. Richie just waits like a teacher for their attention.

                                     RICHIE
                        We'll be handling big shipments, big
                        money, big temptation.
                               (Jones raises his hand)
                        Yeah.

                                     JONES
                        There's a story about you. About
                        turning in some money. A lot of money.
                        Is it true?

           Jones isn't the only one here curious to know.        Simply:

      Abruzzo, looking like a junkie, dirty jeans, wool cap,
      approaches a dealer on the corner. The perspective shifts
      to Richie, Spearman and Jones in a car, watching as Abruzzo
      chats briefly with the dealer before the exchange takes
      place: $10 for a blue-cellophane packet.

108   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - LATER - DAY                  108

      Richie and the others watch Jones tests the heroin.

                                JONES
                   Stuff's ten percent pure. Strong
                   enough to smoke for all those suburban
                   white kids afraid of needles.

      The other detectives are exchange a glance.       None has ever
      heard of anything on the street that pure.

                                RICHIE
                   You paid ten bucks for it?

                                JONES
                   And it's all that's out there.

                                RICHIE
                   Now, how is that possible? Who can
                   afford to sell shit twice as good for
                   half as much?
      Richie glances to a Table of Organization: Surveillance
      photos haphazardly thumb-tacked to a bulletin board - known
      dope men in the hierarchies of their individual crime
      families - almost all of them Italian.

      An airstrip: Slicing propellers. Wounded soldiers on
      stretchers, helped onto a transport plane. Nearby, four
      large crates - Japanese TVs - under cargo netting. The
      pilot stuffs more cash in a pouch and salutes Nate.

      The same plane on the tarmac here, taxiing. A pile of
      discarded TV boxes outside a supply warehouse.

      At the perimeter of the base, black servicemen transfer
      heavy taped-up duffel bags from an Army Jeep to a station
      wagon, hoisting those that won't fit inside onto a roof
      rack. Two Lucas brothers tie them down with twine.

      The station wagon heading north on a rain-slicked highway,

      Empty milk sugar boxes. Redtop and her five table workers
      - clothed now, the surgical masks dangling from their necks -
      wiping down table surfaces, scales and apparatus. Tens of
      thousands of blue-cellophane packets of heroin neatly cover
      two of the folding tables.

      August. Hot. Kids wrench open a fire hydrant and with an
      empty soda can direct the water into a fountain. The water
      sprays down onto the windshield of a beat-up Chevy coming
      slowly through, revealing when it clears, Frank behind the
      wheel. He parks. Glances at his watch.

120   INT. NYPD 23RD PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                  120

      Clock on the wall of a locker area: 3:58. Shift change.

      Air conditioner full blast. Radio announcing the time: 4
      o'clock. Frank glances out the wet windshield of the Chevy
      and watches 116th Street transform:

      It's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls.
      Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts,
      tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems
      - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware.
      Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled
      from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up
      and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably
      filthy rooms, plunged into veins -

124   AND THE REVERSE:                                             124

      10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash
      rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered
      to the Lucas brothers, to:

130   INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - DAY                                    130

      Piles of cash.    The brothers try counting it all, but it's
      just too much.    It's actually tiring.

                                TEDDY
                   We're going to be here all night if we
                   count every bill.

      TIME CUT: A money-counting machine flips through the
      bills, its counter flying. The brothers rubberband it all
      in $100,000 decks. Jot down the numbers. Put the money
      in newly-assembled file boxes. Tape them shut.

131   INT. CHEMICAL BANK - SAFETY-DEPOSIT ROOM - DAY                   131

      Alone in the room, Frank transfers stacks of $100's from the
      file boxes into several open safety-deposit boxes.

132   INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT                         132

      The penthouse is now richly decorated. The R & B music
      playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system. It's a
      kind of office party for Frank's brothers, cousins, wives
      and girlfriends, distributors like Rossi and other East
      Harlem guys, Charlie Williams, couple of cops on Frank's
      payroll, and the Chemical Bank Vice President.

                                BANKER
                   You got a stockbroker, Frank?

                                FRANK
                   I deal with enough crooks as it is.

      The banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of
      one of his business cards.

                                BANKER
                   This one couldn't be more honest. Ask
                   around. He's got a lot of clients in the
                   business. You can't leave all your money
                   in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.

      The banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying
      to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is
      beginning to make him uncomfortable.

                                 CHARLIE
                   Frank.   This is Mike Sibota.

      Sibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels.

                                 FRANK
                   Mr. Sibota.   What can I get you?

                                SIBOTA
                   A left-hander from what Charlie tells me.
                   Your nephew?

      Frank points to his nephew, Stevie, across the room.

                                FRANK
                   It's been his dream all his life to play
                   for the Yankees - and he's good enough.

                                SIBOTA
                   So I hear. You have him come see me.
                   We'll give him a try-out.

      As the scout hands his card to Frank, we whip over to where
      Teddy, his driver Jimmy Racine and their girlfriends, coked
      up, are laughing as a black cop, flashing his detective's
      shield, pretends to frisk Jimmy.

                                DETECTIVE
                   What's this?
                          (taking a .45 from Jimmy's
                           pocket)
                   Oh, that's it, I'm taking you in.

                                JIMMY
                          (joking)
                   You can't take me in for that, I got       a
                   license for that, motherfucker.

                                DETECTIVE
                          (gives the gun back)
                   This then -
                          (the pile of coke on the
                           coffee table)
                   But first -

      The cop sucks up a line before pretending to cuff Jimmy.

                                DETECTIVE
                   All right, now I'm arresting you.

      Everybody laughs.    Teddy peels $100's from a money clip.

                                 TEDDY
                   Let him go.   This is for you.

                                DETECTIVE
                   What is that, a bribe?     Oh, now you're
                   all under arrest.
                                                                       (CONT)

      The cop pretends to arrest them all, but what he doesn't
      pretend is the hand he puts on Jimmy's girlfriend's breast
      as he frisks her.

                                JIMMY
                   What is that?

      It was quick but Jimmy saw it, even though his girlfriend
      didn't react. The cop, oblivious, is cuffing Teddy now.

                                DETECTIVE
                   I'm taking you all in.

                                JIMMY
                   I said, what the fuck was that?

                                DETECTIVE
                   What was what?

      The room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to
      the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his
      fingers onto the carpet. Frank stares.

                                JIMMY
                   Oh, he's all right. I just shot him in
                   the leg. You got a health plan, what are
                   you complaining about. He's fine. Here -
                          (peels off some money)
                   Five hundred all right? Six? Look, he's
                   feeling better all the time.

      Suddenly, Frank grabs Jimmy and throws him against the wall.

133   INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT                        133
      As Ana tries to clean the blood stain on the rug with salt
      and soda water, Frank sits with his five brothers in the
      debris-strewn aftermath of the party. Silence before:

                                FRANK
                   I can't have this kind of stupidity.

                                TEDDY
                   It was an accident.   He feels terrible
                   about it.

                                FRANK
                   He doesn't feel shit, coked up all the
                   time. Get rid of him.

      Frank looks at Teddy in his tinted Jackie Fox-like goggle
      glasses - like he's going to straighten anybody out.

                                FRANK

      Richie sifts through the morning mail at his desk. Stops

                   He's going into New York.   Are we?

                   What are they going to do, arrest us?

                                SPEARMAN
                   They could. New York cops.     They can
                   do worse than that.

                                RICHIE
                   We're not losing that money.    Go.

      As Spearman follows the truck, the George Washington Bridge,
      linking Jersey to Manhattan, looms in the windshield ...

144   EXT. EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY                                   144

      The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue
      grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car
      stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.

      Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is
      talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to
      go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the
      block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the
      restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who
      has to double back quickly not to be seen

      Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading
      crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck
      on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck.
      Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries               
      over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.                   

                               RICHIE
                   Get out.

                               TAXI DRIVER
                   What?

                                RICHIE
                   Get the fuck out of the car!

      The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and
      tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets
      his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags
      the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.

      He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,
      screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead
      - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his
      mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -

      The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another
      red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple
      car-lengths ahead - in sight.

145   EXT. EAST HARLEM - DAY                                          145

      Richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza
      parlor. Richie climbs out, crosses the street. Coming past
      the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride.



                                                                     (CONT)

      From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men
      looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair -
      the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as
      they enter the restaurant.

      Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy
      basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst
      in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on
      the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in
      a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to
      protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.

      Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but
      take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride
      out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they
      come past Richie -

                                RICHIE
                   That's my money.

                                SIU DET 1
                   The fuck are you. What money?

      Richie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics ID.                            

                                RICHIE
                   The bills are sequenced and registered
                   with the Essex County Prosecutors Office.
                   All begin with CF3500. Take a look.

      One of them checks some of the bills and sees he's right.

                                SIU DET. 2
                   Goddamn it, I thought we had a score.
                   I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
                   sitting in my driveway.

                                RICHIE
                   Honest mistake. Just give it back to me.

                                SIU DET. 1
                   This time.

      Three of the four cops laugh. It's an affable gang of
      thieves. The one who doesn't laugh hangs back as the others
      start off. He examines Richie's New Jersey ID.

                     Yeah, I know, like everyone else.
                     Some of them will steal no matter what.                    
                     There can be a camera on them they'll do
                     it. Some'll never do it. The rest are

      Barbecue after their Sunday softball game. Richie and his

      Weequahie jerseys, drinking beer, cooking hamburgers.

                When you asked me to be your son's
                godfather, I took it very seriously.

                             RICHIE
                I know.

      Richie and Tony Zaca relax in the den-like pool house.

                I said yes, I'd take on this
                responsibility, take care of your son,

                Tony, the things she's telling Child
                Social Services make me look very bad:
                Out all night. Lowlife informants
                hanging around.   Women -

                             TONY
                Old friends like me.

      Richie feels horrible doing this.    Silence.   Then:

                             TONY
                It's all right. I understand. They
                ask me, I'll tell them what you want me
                to tell them. I'll lie for you.

                             RICHIE
                Thank you.

      Tony nods, You're welcome.    Can tell there's something else

                You don't have to talk about it, you
                don't want. What do you hear about Blue
                Magic? Anything?

                             TONY
                A lot of sorrow and misery from guys
                being put out of business. That's all.

                                RICHIE
                   Nothing about who's bringing it in?

                                TONY
                   Guys down south is all I heard.

                                RICHIE
                   Down south, Florida?   Cubans?   What.

                                TONY
                   I don't know. All I can tell you is
                   whoever it is, they're upsetting the
                   natural order of things.

      Among the framed family photos around them, is a picture
      of Tony's uncle, Albert Tosca.

157   EXT. LIVINGSTON, NEW JERSEY - DAY                               157

      A Napoleonic statue of the same man on horseback in a
      fountain outside a castle-like mansion. Next to it "ride"
      three others on marble horses - a woman and two children.

      A clay pigeon sails out across the manicured garden. A
      shotgun blast shatters it. The man with the gun - Albert
      Tosca - hands another to Frank. As Frank sets to shoot, Ana
      can seen behind them, with Tosca's wife in the opulent
      house, looking uncomfortable.

                                MRS. TOSCA
                   The whole place was imported brick by
                   brick from Gloucestershire.

                                ANA
                   It's very nice.

      Mrs. Tosca nods. Ana nods. A strained silence thicker than
      the tapestries settles over them until -

                               FRANK
                   Pull -

      The shotgun booms -

      As servants stand by, Tosca and his wife and their only
      guests - Frank and Ana - finished with lunch, get up from
      the table in the formal Formal dining room.

                                                                     (CONT)

      As Mrs. Tosca leads Ana off to give her a tour of the house,
      the men head off the other way.

                                TOSCA
                   She's a lovely girl.    You should marry
                   her.

                                FRANK
                   Too many things to look after right now
                   to think about that.

                                TOSCA
                   Frank. That's a mistake. If I may say.
                   Don't take her for granted, girl like
                   that.

      They enter a rich, wood-paneled study lined with books.

                                TOSCA
                   You interested in history, Frank? The
                   events that have brought us to where we
                   are today? You know who was? Bumpy.

                                FRANK
                   Bumpy was interested in a lot of things.

                                TOSCA
                   I always wonder if people know when
                   history's being made. And what they're
                   doing at the time. This, for instance,
                   could be a historic moment, and you're
                   sipping a glass of ice water.

      Droplets snake down Frank's glass. He senses Tosca has
      finally gotten around to why he was invited here.
                                TOSCA
                   Bumpy and I did a lot of business
                   together, as you know. Whatever he
                   needed, he'd come to me and I'd do my
                   best to provide it. He came to me, I
                   didn't go to him, is the point I'm trying
                   to make. You know why?

                                FRANK
                   He didn't have what you needed. You had
                   what he needed. We've always had to come
                   to you.

                                 TOSCA
                   Yes.   Until now.

      Tosca studies Frank, who is a study in inscrutability.

                                                                      (CONT)

                                TOSCA
                   Monopolies are illegal in this country,
                   Frank, because no one can compete with a
                   monopoly. If they let the dairy farmers
                   do that, half of them would go out of
                   business tomorrow.

                                FRANK
                   I'm just trying to make a living.

                                TOSCA
                   Which is your right. Because this is
                   America. But not at the unreasonable
                   expense of others. That's un-American.
                          (he studies Frank)
                   You know the price you pay for a gallon
                   of milk doesn't represent its true cost
                   of production. It's controlled. Set.

                                FRANK
                   I set a price I think is fair.

                                TOSCA
                   It's very unfair, in fact. Your
                   customers are happy, but what about your
                   fellow dairy farmers? You're not
                   thinking of them.

                                FRANK
                          (very calmly)
                   I'm thinking of them as much as they ever
                   thought of me.

                                TOSCA
                   All right. I can see you're getting
                   excited. Don't get excited. That's not
                   why I invited you to my home. To get
                   excited.

      Frank doesn't look excited at all. He's the picture of
      calm. Tosca smiles benignly and gets up.

                                TOSCA
                   Here, I got something for you.

      Tosca opens a humidor, takes out a couple of Cuban cigars.

                                TOSCA
                   Now what if - I'm just thinking out loud -
                   you sold some of your inventory wholesale
                   and I helped with the distribution.

                                FRANK
                   I don't need it. I already got
                   everything from 110th Street to Yankee
                   Stadium, river to river.

                                TOSCA
                   Which is a little mom and pop store
                   compared to what I'm talking about. I
                   could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A.,
                   Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I'm speaking
                   nationwide. And I'd guarantee you peace
                   of mind. You know what I mean by that.

      Frank does. It's a backhanded threat.        Tosca clips the
      cigars with a gold guillotine

                                TOSCA
                   Frank. You can see I'm a Renaissance
                   man. Unfortunately not all my people are
                   as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil
                   rights, they don't know. They're not as
                   open to change from the way things are
                   done and who's doing it. But I can talk
                   to them so there won't be any
                   misunderstanding. That's what I mean by
                   peace of mind.

      Frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in
      this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad.

                                FRANK
                   You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd
                   consider 50. And I can get you as much
                   as you want.
      Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo
      would be an extraordinary coup for him.

                                TOSCA
                   You see, I was right. This is a
                   historic moment. You're going to be
                   bigger than Bumpy himself.

      He hands Frank one of the cigars, expertly prepared.

                                TOSCA
                   Can't smoke it here, unfortunately.
                   Grace doesn't like it. Take it with you.

                                                                   67.

      Doc waits by the car as Frank and Ana walk toward him.
      The Toscas wave goodbye from the front step of the mansion.
      Frank slips the cigar into his top pocket as they climb in.

                             ANA
                Why would you trust these people, the way
                they look at you?

                             FRANK
                They look at me like it's Christmas and
                I'm Santa Claus.

                             ANA
                They looked at us like we're the help.

                              FRANK
                        (kisses her cheek)
                No.   They're working for me now.

      A TV: Muhammad Ali, the black man's black man, and Joe
      Frazier, the white man's black man, at their 1971 Madison
      Square Garden press conference where Ali says as much.

      Most of the guys watching it. Richie isn't. He comes
      over to Table of Organization. Tacks his Bar Association
      notice to it. Regards the photographs, like tentacles of
      octopus yet to have a head.

      Only the lowest section is made up of blacks (including
      Charlie Williams and Jackie Fox, but not Frank Lucas). The
      rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up.
      They've hit a wall they can't get past.

      Another TV here: Howard Cosell, ringside at the Garden as
      the first early fans arrive, pointing out that the fight,
      because of the political stand Ali's taken, is less about
      boxers than war versus anti-war.

      Frank chooses a linen jacket from his extensive color-
      coordinated racks of Phil Cromfeld suits as Ana, in her
      lingerie, puts on make-up at a vanity. He comes up behind
      her and sets down a small jewelry box.

           engagement ring on her finger. She wipes at a tear, then
           gets up and hugs him.

                        Yes.

           She kisses him.     Admires the ring.     And -

                        I bought you something, too.

           She crosses past the TV, takes a garment bag down from her
           side of the closet, lays it on the bed next to Frank's suit
           jacket. She takes hold of the zipper but doesn't
           immediately pull it, hoping perhaps to create some dramatic
           tension.

                        What is it?

           She unzips the bag like she's unveiling great art. But
           instead of seeing what's inside, we're allowed only Frank's
           reaction: his smile of anticipation slowly changing to
           chagrin.

           Richie observes celebrities and gangsters arriving in
           limousines - Sammy Davis Jr. and his wife, Joe Louis and
           his, Tosca and some of his guys - then enters the arena as
           another limo pulls up. Ana climbs out.

                                     ANA
                        Come on. You look great.

                        You want to miss the fight? Come on.

           Finally, a patent leather shoe pokes out, sets down on the
           curb. Then its mate beside it. The shoes step away from
           the limo and -

           photographers, regards the organized crime figures ringside.
           He takes a few pictures with the long lens camera as -

      The owner of the gleaming patent leather shoes is shown to
      his second row ringside seat just behind the sports writers,
      and we move up the full-length chinchilla coat to Frank's
      uneasy expression -

      Richie's camera roams the faces of the prime ticket holders
      ringside: organized crime figures, celebrities, politicians,              
      women with plunging necklines and platinum hair -                         

                                 JOE LOUIS                                      
                   Excuse me -                                                  

      Richie can't believe it's Joe Louis brushing past him -                   

                                 RICHIE                                         
                   Mr. Louis -                                                  

      Joe looks back as Richie approaches him -                                 

                                RICHIE                                          
                   I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you,                      
                   sir, you were a hero to me growing up. I                     
                   still push elevator buttons eight times                      
                   for the rounds you beat Billy Conn in.                       
                   For luck.                                                    

      Louis acknowledges Richie only slightly more than not at                  
      all. Turns away to join his friends. Richie watches after                 
      him, stung by Louis's disregard.                                          

      He snaps a picture of an Italian wise guy he doesn't                      
      recognize ... sifts the camera's view past Frank in the                   
      chinchilla coat ... then returns to him, watches as Tosca                 
      and his guys sit down behind Frank. Richie can't hear -                   
      but can see - their good-natured exchange -

                                TOSCA
                   Hey, Frank, you keep that hat on, I'm
                   gonna miss the fight -

      The odd thing to Richie is, Chinchilla's seat is better
      than all the Italians'. Detective Trupo notices this, too.
      Richie focuses on the Chincilla's date, a stunning girl, a
      beauty queen, then shifts back to her boyfriend who's now
      shaking the proffered hands of other Italians, then Don
      King. Joe Louis himself - who barely acknowledged Richie's                
      existence - comes over and playfully exchanges "punches"                  
      with the man in the chinchilla coat.

      A sudden roar from the crowd as the lights go out except
      for the spot on the ring. Ali and Frazier are coming down
      the steps through the crush of fans and reporters, preceded
      by soldiers carrying flags -
                                                                       (CONT)

      Richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but
      he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as
      Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring -

      Flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet
      begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing
      along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla
      coat, focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light, and
      snaps the shutter -

      Richie tacks the photograph of the man in the chinchilla
      coat to his Table of Organization - low and off to the side
      by other pieces of the puzzle that don't fit, other new
      faces with no names. Spearman holds a scrap of paper -

                   That's is the plate number on the limo.
                   Check with the company, who rented it.

                   He's a supplier at most. Or just a pimp.
                   We'd've heard of him otherwise.

                                RICHIE
                   No, he's bigger than that. His seats                       
                   were phenomenal; better than Al Tosca's.                   
                   Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin hand.                   

      They look from Tosca's high position on the board to Frank's
      low one, and a wedding march played in traditional fashion
      on organ begins and carries over:

      shots of him years younger, the photograph from the fights
      and some more from subsequent surveillances.

                   this without informants and powder, no

                   Won't get any informants. Not inside.
                   It's like a Sicilian family. Like he's
                   structured his own family the same way to
                   protect himself.

      dances with Ana before the reception guests.

                Being with Bumpy long as he was, he
                would have been around Italians a lot.
                Enough to learn that much.

      Flanked front and rear by Frank's security, the marriage
      car moves along a rain-slick street. The newlyweds cuddle
      in back. Another car pulls up alongside - Trupo's Shelby -
      and Doc's right hand instinctively comes off the steering
      wheel to settle on his holstered gun. Trupo smiles and
      shakes his head, no.

      If Frank is surprised Trupo knows his name, he doesn't show

      Trupo looks in at Ana in the back seat, smiles at her. She
      turns her head away and closes the door. Trupo leads Frank

      She comes past the TV and into the kitchen past a table
      covered with dope paraphernalia.

                   Where is my fuckin dope? You and your

      Richie's had Jimmy Racine brought over. Sits with him as
      the Three Amigos watch from the shadows. Just coming off
      his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented
      as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement.

                             RICHIE
                Because it's an attempted homicide,
                that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury
                could come in very favorably. Might turn
                out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self
                Defense even. She had a knife. Depends
                on how I want to deal with you. You see
                where this is going.

      Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern.

                             JIMMY
                The fuck is this place?

                Let's say you beat it somehow. What do
                you think Cousin Frank'll think of that?
                He knows you had to sit here listening to
                something like this. And then you beat
                an attempted murder? Is he stupid?
                He'll assume you talked.

      Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him.

      The detectives' cars parked behind a warehouse. Richie
      peers into binoculars at: Teddy's car parked by Frank's
      outside another warehouse loading dock. Frank gets out,
      discusses something with his brother, comes past Jimmy to
      some men in bloody white coats.

      He talks to them, returns to his car, takes a valise from
      the trunk. He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands
      it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's
      direction. Though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave
      to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out -

       Opens the front door. Finds no one there - except a large
       live turkey on the doorstep. He stares at it nonplussed,
       then looks up to a sound - a whoosh - as flames engulf the
       interior and spit out the windows of his Shelby Mustang ...

                   You're     too busy to meet with Billy
                   Martin?   After I set it up?

      Stevie shifts around, not wanting to make Frank mad ...

                                STEVIE
                   I don't want to play pro ball, I decided.

                                  FRANK
                   What're you   talking about? This is your
                   dream since   you were their age -
                          (the   younger kids)
                   Maybe I can   set it up again.

      Stevie just stands there, uncomfortable.         Finally -

                                STEVIE
                   It's not what I want. I want to do what
                   you do, Uncle Frank. I want to be you.

      Frank stares at him unhappily.       Teddy comes over but Frank
      barely notices.

                                TEDDY
                   We got a problem.

217   INT. TEDDY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                        217

      Jimmy Racine behind the wheel.       Frank and Teddy in back,
      speaking quietly.

                                TEDDY
                   He's been cutting it so much it's down
                   to two, three percent pure.
                                FRANK
                   You tested it. You're sure.

      Teddy nods. Frank notices Jimmy looking at them in the rear
      view mirror.

                                FRANK
                   The fuck you looking at?

218   EXT. JACKIE FOX'S CLUB - NEW YORK - DUSK                          218

      The car pulls up in front of a building in the clothing
      district. Jimmy stays while Teddy and Frank go inside.

                                                                   82.
                             




219   INT. JACKIE FOX'S CLUB - DUSK                                 219

      Jackie's club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film.
      Frank and Teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey
      carcasses and other remnants of Thanksgiving to where Jackie
      and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls.

                              JACKIE
                Frank.   Welcome.

                             FRANK
                We need to talk.

                              JACKIE
                Great.   Girls, get out.

      The girls gather their things and leave. Frank wipes at a
      modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away,
      sits. Jackie lays out a couple lines, offers Frank a rolled
      up hundred dollar straw. Frank shakes his head, no thanks.

                             JACKIE
                You talked to Charlie. You want to hear
                more about my Black Coalition. Let me
                explain it to you -

      But first, let me suck up a line of coke -

                             FRANK
                That's not why I'm here.
                       (Jackie glances up from the
                        powder. No?)
                Everybody's happy, Jackie. Charlie, Baz,
                the cops, the Italians, everybody.
                Everybody except you.

                             JACKIE
                I'm happy.

                             FRANK
                Then I don't understand. Why do you have
                to take something that's perfectly good
                the way it is, and wreck it?

      Jackie doesn't seem to understand.

                             FRANK
                Brand names mean something, Jackie.
                Consumers rely on them to know what
                they're getting. They know the company
                isn't going to try to fool them with an
                inferior product. They buy a Ford, they
                know they're gonna get a Ford.

                   Not a fuckin Datsun.
                          (his look says, right?)
                   Blue Magic is a brand name; as much a
                   brand name as Pepsi. I own it. I stand
                   behind it. I guarantee it and people
                   know that even if they don't know me any
                   more than they know the chairman of
                   General Foods.

                                JACKIE
                   What the fuck are you talking about,
                   Frank?

                                FRANK
                   What you're doing, as far as I'm
                   concerned, when you chop my dope down to
                   five percent, is trademark infringement.

      That.   That's what this is about.      Jackie nods, but -

                                JACKIE
                   With all due respect, Frank, if I buy
                   something, I can do whatever I want with
                   it.

                                FRANK
                   That's not true. That's where you're
                   wrong.

                                JACKIE
                   If I buy a car, I can paint it, God damn
                   it.

                                FRANK
                   Jackie, you don't need to. You don't
                   need to make more money than you can with
                   Blue the way it is. No one does. At a
                   certain point it's just greed.

                                JACKIE
                   What do you want, Frank?    You want me to
                   call it something else?

                                FRANK
                   I have to insist. You call it Blue
                   Magic, that's misrepresentation.

                                JACKIE
                   Fine. I'll call it Red Magic, even
                   though it doesn't sound as good.

                                FRANK
                   That's all I'm saying.   Wrap it in red

                   this again.

      Jackie regards Frank for a long moment ...

                                JACKIE
                   Catch me? Insist? Infringement? I
                   don't like these words as much as please -
                   thank you - sorry to bother you, Jackie.
                   These are better words to use you come
                   into my place without an invitation.

      Jackie waits to hear a kinder word but Frank doesn't offer
      one. Jackie nods, Fine, okay, but it's more like a warning.

      Frank pulls a girl off Teddy's lap and points him toward
      the door. Jackie watches them leave.

                                FRANK
                   You don't go over there any more.

      Teddy doesn't like it, but nods. Suddenly his face is
      illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an
      unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights.

                                FRANK
                   It's all right, pull over, what are they
                   going to do? Give us a ticket?

      But Teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over.

                                                                     85.
                               




223   EXT. GARMENT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NY - LATE AFTERNOON           223

      Teddy's -

                              TEDDY
                Frank?   Some of it's in the trunk.

      Frank regards him with utter disbelief. Teddy shies as if
      he expects to get hit. The SIU detectives arrive.

                             TRUPO
                Hello, Frank.

                             FRANK
                Detective. How's it going?        You have a
                nice Thanksgiving?

                             TRUPO
                I did not, as a matter of fact.       Get out
                of the car.

      The Lucases climb out.

                             FRANK
                Where's the Shelby?

                             TRUPO
                The Shelby's gone, Frank.

      Trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys
      from the ignition and comes around to the trunk. Frank and
      Teddy exchange a glance as it opens. Silence. Then -
                             TRUPO
                Want to come over here a minute, Frank?

      Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light.
      Frank and Trupo regard it in silence. Then -

                             TRUPO
                Now what are we gonna do about this?

                             FRANK
                We're gonna shut the trunk and say good
                night, forget you pulled us over.

                             TRUPO
                I got a better idea.

      Trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin
      bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank -

                    threw you and your brother in the fuckin

       They hold each others' stare for a long moment.

                    I loved that car.

                                    FRANK
                    I know.

       Trupo closes the trunk and walks away with his cut of the
       heroin, calling to his partner -

       From outside the driver's side, Teddy's head, inside the
       car, suddenly smashes against the window, cracking it. His
       groan is interrupted by Frank's muffled voice -

       elsewhere. A ringing phone pulls him out of it.

                   energy. It rearranges the molecules.

                   Of what.

                   Of anything. Of popcorn. You don't                           
                   want to put your head in there.                              

      Tony rakes out the plain, `pre-microwaveable' popcorn,                    
      using his hand. Gives some to Richie. Half of it's burnt.                 

                                TONY                                            
                   I can get you one of these. Just like                        
                   this, brand new. I'll have it delivered.                     

                                 RICHIE                                         
                   No, thanks.   I don't want one.                              

      Tony hands Richie some snapshots: The Zaca family on the                  
      slopes of a resort, and in and outside a beautiful snow-
      dotted cabin.

                                RICHIE
                   This is nice, where's this?

                   I'd like to ski Aspen some day.

                   Know who we met? Burt Reynolds. I'm not
                   kidding. Lot of people from Hollywood go
                   up there now, buying up everything.

                                RICHIE

                   Are you kidding? You know what it's
                   worth? Ski-in-ski-out, five bedrooms,
                   sauna, everything. We were guests.
                          (pause)
                   No ... No, that's your place.

      Everything seems to stop. Richie becomes aware of the
      sounds around them, the girls splashing around outside ...

                   Isn't there something we can do - about
                   leaving the big guy alone? You know who
                   I mean.

      What Richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at
      this point he's got a problem.

                                RICHIE
                   If I don't report what you just said
                   to me, you know I could be in a lot of
                   trouble. If I do, then it's you.

                                TONY
                   I'm hoping you won't do that.

      Richie considers the room itself, measuring the odds of
      microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere.

                                TONY
                   I'm not taping it. How do you know?
                   Because we're friends and I'm telling
                   you. This is a real offer.

                   Why would you do this? Why would you                      
                   risk our friendship?

      Richie stares at Tony, then puts the pictures in his hand.

        Alone in the empty building, he stares at the T.O.: The
        higher echelon Italians like Tosca; lower echelon Harlem
        guys like Charlie Williams and Frank Lucas.

        He gets up then, untacks Frank's photograph from its lowly
        position and moves it to a place no black has ever occupied -
        to the top of the pyramid - above the mafia.

                  INS, FBI, IRS - I can't get anything out
                  of them. Nothing on his travel, his bank
                  accounts, property holdings - nothing.

                               TOBACK
                  That's because they all think you're on
                  the take and you think they are.

                  They don't want this to stop. It                            
                  employs too many people. Cops, lawyers,                     
                  judges, probation officers, prison                          
                  guards. The day dope stops coming into                      
                  this country, a hundred thousand people                     
                  lose their jobs.                                            
        Toback isn't as sure the corruption of the official world is
        that complete.

        Spearman gestures to a couple of men in suits who want to
        talk to him.

                  Who took it out?
                         (nothing from the agents)
                  If there's a contract on me, it would be

                    We can't say without compromising our
                    source. You understand.

                                   RICHIE
                    No.    I don't. Not when it's my life.

                                 FBI AGENT
                    If you want, we can assign someone to
                    you.

                    Who?    FBI?   You're going to protect me?

       Richie almost laughs at the thought, looks to Toback.             In
       fact, none of this is funny.

C231   EXT. STREET - NEWARK - NIGHT                                      C231

       Walking toward his apartment down its dark street, bag of
       groceries in arm, Richie becomes aware someone is following
       him. He slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then
       turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head.

                                   MAN
                    Don't shoot!    For God's sake.

       Richie keeps the gun pressed against the guy's forehead.

                    Laurie. I'm sorry I couldn't give you
                    the kind of life you wanted. I'm sorry
                    it was never enough. But don't punish me
                    for being honest. Don't take my son
                    away.

       She stares at him in disbelief.        Then responds in a louder
       voice than his -

                   What are you saying? That because you
                   were "honest" and didn't take money like
                   every other cop, I left you?

      The bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care.

                                LAURIE
                   You don't take money for one reason:
                   to buy being dishonest about everything
                   else. And that's worse than taking money
                   nobody gives a shit about - drug money,
                   gambling money nobody's gonna miss.
                          (more people look over)
                   I'd rather you took it and been honest
                   with me. Or don't take it, I don't care.
                   But don't then go cheat on me. Don't
                   cheat on your kid by never being around.
                   Don't go out and get laid by your
                   snitches and secretaries and strippers.
                   I can tell just by looking, she's one
                   of them.

      His lawyer.    Which is true.    Everyone's watching them now.

                                LAURIE
                   You think you're going to heaven because
                   your "honest." You're not. You're going

      The same judge who sends a collection plate around sits

                                SHEILA
                   Your honor, a lot has been said here
                   today about how unsavory Mr. Roberts'
                   environment is for a child. How
                   dangerous it is. I'm sorry, but this is
                   our world. This is where we live and we
                   tell him, Protect us. We give him that
                   responsibility, and then say, Oh, but we
                   don't trust you to raise a child. We
                   don't think you're fit for that.

           Silence. Sheila looks at him, but he's looking at Laurie,
           and speaks to her like they're alone in the room:

           Seats covered with Christmas presents. Doc, driving, sees
           Trupo's car parked out front Frank's penthouse.

           Doc pulls to the curb outside Frank's building. As the
           doorman helps Doc with the big Christmas tree tied to the
           roof of the car, Frank crosses to Trupo's car with a couple
           of bottles of Crystal tied with holiday bows.

           Charlie has come to visit. A Christmas carol plays as Frank
           strings the tree with some lights.

      Frank plugs the cord in and the tree lights up.

                   Someone's been following me. Besides
                   cops. I see cars where they shouldn't

      Ana hangs tinsel on the tree as Frank gives the shepherd
      some dog toy presents he's bought. More to himself:

                                FRANK
                   Bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain
                   point. He stayed in - read - watched TV -
                   played chess. I thought he chose to lead
                   a quiet life. He didn't. He couldn't go
                   out without something happening.

                                ANA
                   We can still go out.

                                FRANK
                   Where? With who? Everyone I know is
                   under surveillance. I can't even be with
                   my family at Christmas anymore.

      He gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at
      Christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on
      the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover
      cops, at Trupo's car, still parked outside.

                                ANA
                   Why don't you just pay who you have to
                   pay?

                                FRANK
                   I do pay them, I pay them all. Cops,
                   accountants, lawyers, who don't I pay?
                   Everybody. I pay them a fortune, it
                   doesn't matter. It doesn't satisfy them.
                   The more you pay, the more they expect.

                        You can't start with them because they
                        can't stop. It's like dope. They
                        always want more.

           Ana looks vulnerable. Frank almost feels bad that it's his
           life and problems that have put them here. Eventually, to
           try to turn it around -

           Doc draws his two guns and fires back at the car, hitting

        He grabs her and holds her to calm her down.

                                   FRANK
                     Shhh.   Come on, now.   Shhh.

        He holds her close, waits for her breathing to slow before:

                     Where are we going to go? Spain?

        Richie, at his desk, looks up to see Trupo walking through
        the squad room, followed by Spearman.

                                  SPEARMAN
                     Said he'll only talk to you.

B265    INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - LATER - MORNING              B265

        Trupo's attitude has completely changed from the first time
        they met. He talks to Richie now like a fellow conspirator -


                                                                        (CONT)

                                 TRUPO
                    From what I hear, it was the Corsicans.
                    The French Connection, Fernando Rey, the
                    exporters Frank has put out of business.
                    Now, I can take care of him in New York,
                    but I don't want to have to worry every
                    time he drives across the bridge to
                    Jersey someone's gonna take another shot
                    at him.

       Richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that Trupo
       would speak to him this blatantly.

                                 TRUPO
                    We need to start working together. We
                    need to step up our efforts. Next time
                    their aim could be better. We need to
                    keep this cash cow alive.

       Jimmy Racine comes in - sees Trupo - and leaves - but not
       before Trupo has seen him. And now he sees the Lucas Table
       of Organization he didn't notice when he came in. Gets up
       and walks over to it now and takes a closer look. Sees
       Frank's picture at the top, like Enemy Number 1.

                                 TRUPO
                    Jesus. What the fuck you doing here?
                    You actually going to arrest Frank Lucas?
                    What's the matter with you?

                                 RICHIE
                    I'm crazy. Can't you tell that? I'm
                    crazy enough to shoot someone and make it
                    look like an accident next time he comes
                    over the bridge without my permission.
                    Get the fuck out of New Jersey.

       They regard each other a moment before Trupo turns to leave.

       A large TV shows chaotic scenes in Saigon. The US is
       pulling out of Vietnam. Tosca has come to see how Frank is
       recovering, and finds him, agitated, too long in bed even
       though it's only been a day, changing into a nice shirt,
       putting on his shoes -

                    I'll take that gun away and shove it up
                    their ass.

                                 TOSCA
                    I don't know that it was any of them,
                    Frank. Neither do you.

                                 FRANK
                    Then maybe I'll kill them all just to
                    make a fuckin point.

       Tosca seems more philosophical about it - like Bumpy might
       have been - but it wasn't him who was shot at.

                                 TOSCA
                    You want to know who it was? I can
                    tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival.
                    Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a
                    name for himself. Or someone you forgot
                    to pay off. Or slighted without
                    realizing it. Or someone you put out of
                    business by being too successful.
                           (pause)
                    Success has a lot of enemies. Your
                    success is who took a shot at you. How
                    you gonna kill it? By being
                    unsuccessful? You can be successful and
                    have enemies, or unsuccessful and have
                    friends. It's the choice we make.

      The same farm and hut as before. Frank and the Chinese
      General sip tea. The four million dollars in cash Frank
      brought sits on the table.

                                GENERAL
                   Opium plants are hearty enough to
                   outlive any war. They'll still be here
                   long after the troops are gone. But what
                   are you going to do for transportation
                   when the last US plane goes home?

                                FRANK
                   I'll figure something out.      You'll see
                   me again.
      The General seems fond of Frank, and not only because of all
      the money on the table.

                                GENERAL
                   It's not in my best interest to say
                   this, Frank ... but quitting while you're
                   ahead is not the same as quitting.

                                FRANK
                   That's what my wife thinks.

                                GENERAL
                   But you don't think she's right.

      Frank doesn't say.

       The mule train approaches the jungle that surrounds the
       opium farm. Nate's Thai thugs, left behind in sniper
       positions in the trees, stand ready to open fire if they
       have to as Frank, Nate, the soldiers and mules pass below.

B270   EXT. JUNGLE - LATER - DAY                                      B270

       They seem to have made it, winding back down through the
       jungle with the mules. Suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts
       from the trees - a couple of Nate's men are hit as the rest
       dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire.
       Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots
       into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.

                              FRANK
                 Give them half!

       Nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the
       noise.

                              FRANK
                 Cut half of them loose!      The mules!

       Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the
       animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees
       the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from
       all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais
       and Americans lying dead on the ground.

      The plane has been brought into a hangar where it's being

      Trupo and his detectives, upstairs, ransacking a bedroom.              

      Upstairs - the SIU detectives pull open drawers, throw                 
      clothes from the closets.   Trupo picks up an invitation to            
      a United Nations ball, tosses it down again. Finds a safety-

                   The warrant permits me to search the
                   plane and its cargo.

      The captain doesn't comply. Richie moves to open the coffin
      himself and every soldier's shouldered rifle immediately
      comes into firing position, aimed at him.

      Richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding
      them, safeties off, fingers on the triggers; all they're
      waiting for is their commander's order to fire.

298   INT. AIRPORT HANGER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY             298

      Richie and Toback sit before the Federal Attorneys and
      customs agents. The US Attorney hangs up a phone ... then:

                             US ATTORNEY
                That was a military transport plane. If
                there was heroin on board then someone in
                the military would have to be involved.
                Which means that even as it fights a war
                that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives,
                the military is smuggling narcotics.

      Richie's in serious trouble and knows it.    As does Toback.

                             US ATTORNEY
                That's how these events are being
                interpreted by General Easton in that
                call to me. That someone employed by the
                this office believes the United States
                Army is in the drug trafficking business -
                and is trying to prove it by desecrating
                the remains of young men who've given
                their lives in the defence of democracy.

                             RICHIE
                There are drugs on that plane -

                             US ATTORNEY
                Shut the fuck up.

      Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for
      these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act
      as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate
      organization of his world, his superiors.

                             US ATTORNEY
                Is it any wonder then, because of your
                actions, the entire federal narcotics
                program is now in jeopardy of being
                dismantled as completely and enthusiastic-
                ally as that fucking transport plane?

                I had good information the target of my
                investigation was bringing dope in on

                   Frank Lucas.

      No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever
      heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly.

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Who?  Who's Frank Lucas?
                          (no one seems to know)
                   Who's he work for? Which family?

                   He's not Italian. He's black.

      Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before -

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
                   You're this close to the end of your
                   career in law enforcement, you're making
                   jokes?

                                RICHIE
                   I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia
                   in the dope business. I believe he buys
                   direct from the source in Southeast Asia,
                   cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US
                   military planes and personnel to bring
                   pure No. 4 heroin into United States.

      Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make
      sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to
      his defense -
                                TOBACK
                   Richie has a lot of experience -

       Ana stares at the floor. It all just seems to get worse and
       worse. They had their chance to get out and missed it.

                                 FRANK

       Frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room.
       Nods to Doc to say, Get the car, I'll be out in a minute.
       Goes over to his mother.

                                 MRS. LUCAS
                    Sit down.

       He sits. She studies him in a way she hasn't since he was
       little. Eventually -

                    If you'd have been a preacher, your
                    brothers would be preachers. If you'd
                    been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. Do
                    you know that?
                           (he doesn't say)
                    They all came here because of you. You
                    called and they came running. They look
                    up to you. They expect you to always
                    know what's best.
                           (pause)
                    But even they know you don't shoot

                    You seem to be the only one who doesn't.

                    Is that where I'm going?

                    I never asked you where all this came
                    from because I didn't want to hear you
                    lie to me. Don't lie to me. Don't do
                    that, too.

                     I know I will.

        Frank has some trouble looking at her. But then gets up.
        Walks toward the front door to leave. Hesitates near it a
        long moment. Then turns and walks upstairs. Trupo will
        live, at least for now, because of her.

        Down in the basement, the body bags are lifted from the
        wooden coffins. Set down on tables. The bags unzipped and
        the bodies removed.

        A rack of clean uniforms is brought in. The morticians
        begin dressing the corpses and applying make-up on the dry
        gray skin.

        New white military caskets are trundled in. Gold handles
        lifted. The bodies, clothed and painted now, are deposited
        on the silk linings. The lids of the coffins come down and
        cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top.

        Two black privates on janitorial duty come into the room
        where the original plain wooden coffins have been discarded.
        They remove the lids, then the finely-crafted false bottoms,
        revealing in 4-inch cavities of each, tightly-packed bricks
        of Double UO Globe heroin. As they take them out, a gospel
        choir begins and continues over:

        A laundry truck idles. Stevie, the Lucas nephew who could
        have played for Yankees, jumps down, helps the two privates
        toss several laundry bags into the back of the truck.

                                                                         113.

           The laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base,
           drives past a stand of trees. As it passes, Richie, parked            
           by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's          
           wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his T.O. photo.               

           As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two               
           Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. The detectives

           gospel choir. As always, no matter what else is going on in
           his complicated life, Frank sits with his mother and Ana in
           their usual pew. The gospel music continues over:

           Frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and Ana and
           put them in a car with a driver. He climbs into Doc's
           alone. His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends
           to go kill Trupo after all. As Doc's car leaves, so does
           another.

       Red Top's van makes a turn. As Abruzzo's makes the same
       turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up
       in his windshield.

       His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he
       sees Jones's car slow. Teddy's car approaches from another
       direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull
       over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows
       to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the
       foreboding towers. The gospel music ends.

       and hands Richie the search warrant.

                                                                  116.
                            




331    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                        331

       The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every
       activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a
       stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on
       bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench.

       The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place
       teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move
       under the shadow of the towers.

332    INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY           332

       Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the
       wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by
       more detectives to a stairwell. The place is like Beirut.
       Debris-strewn, graffiti-covered.

A333   EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUED - DAY                             A333

       Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried
       flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit
       on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave
       nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance.

333    INT. STAIRWELL - FLOORS - SOUTH TOWER - DAY                  333

       Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like
       commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow
       intensifying the higher up they go.

       Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound
       before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a
       Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the
       sound fades.

334    INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY                                334

       Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo,
       voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a
       corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a
       sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door.

       They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers
       with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks
       up to the guys with the guns.

                              SPEARMAN
                 I got to talk to Teddy.

                              GUY WITH GUN
                 Get the fuck out of here.

                                                                  (CONT)

                                SPEARMAN
                   What the fuck is that? I got business
                   with Teddy and it's none of your fuckin
                   business except to knock on the fuckin
                   door and get him.

      As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it
      hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the
      floor. The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets.
      Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as
      Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -

335   INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - CONTINUOUS                      335

      The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy,
      panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in
      yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere
      inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back -
      crawling across the floor like an infantrymen -

      Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his
      pistol. But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on
      a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another
      dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door -

336   INT. THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                        336

      As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls
      echoing in the stairwell. He starts down, taking the stairs
      five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights -                      

      Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into            
      an apartment. Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is          
      goes out onto an exterior balcony -                                  
      Richie continues along the interior corridor, running                
      parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris         
      and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie -                  

      Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but           
      the door to the balcony is nailed shut. So are the windows.          
      Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and,          
      just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him,           
      hitting him in the head.                                             

      He falls hard, dazed. Richie hurries through the broken              
      window. Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks          
      his femur with his bare hands. Teddy howls in excruciating
      pain -

337   INT/EXT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY                                    337

341    EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUED - DAY                                341

       Frank, on a wooden folding chair at Bumpy's grave, hears
       the gunning of engines and barking of cops. He turns to see
       Doc being handcuffed on the ground by the Towncar. Glances
       to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. Richie.

       Richie arrives at the grave. Regards the monument to
       Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him.
       Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...

                              RICHIE
                 What kind of trees are these?

       Frank looks at the trees, then at Richie, with equal
       serenity.

                              FRANK
                 You think you got Frank Lucas.      You
                 got nothing.

A342   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 A342    
       Richie cuts the tags off a new, inexpensive suit. Slips               
       the jacket on, which seemed somehow to fit a little better            
       at the store. Cuts the tags off a tie.                                

B342   INT. COURTHOUSE MENS ROOM - DAY                               B342    

       Someone throwing up in a stall. The toilet flushes, the               
       door opens and Richie steps up to a sink, regards his face            
       in the mirror. Under the fluorescent lights - maybe under             
       any kind - his skin is a shade of death. He splashes water            
       on it and tries to gather himself.                                    

342    INT. COURTROOM - DAY                                           342

       At the prosecutors table, Richie steals glances at the
       battery of expensive attorneys over at the defense table.


                                                                    (CONT)

                                                                    119.
                              
342   CONTINUED:                                                     342


      The courtroom doors swing open and Richie sees Frank Lucas,
      in a tailored suit, escorted in without cuffs by an amiable-           
      looking federal marshal.

      As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of
      the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile
      and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived.

      Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons,
      stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings,
      heroin in blue cellophane.

      Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself
      who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Champ
      hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and
      Richie wonders if he should just give up now.

      Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to
      Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful
      women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old
      mother giving him a hug.

      He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his
      phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie
      in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table.

      Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask,
      Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can
      you see how insignificant you are?                                     

      Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank                  
      brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within            
      the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team.            
                                JUDGE                                        
                   Mr. Roberts -                                             

      Richie slowly lifts himself from his chair, steps forward,             
      turns to look at the jury that's studying him, finally finds           
      his voice:                                                             

                                RICHIE                                       
                   Thank you, your Honor.   Ladies and                       
                   gentlemen -                                               

343   INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY                        343

      Wire mesh separates Frank from his battalion of lawyers.
      He glances over them to Richie being led through the large
      Visiting Room.

                                FRANK
                   Here he is, let me talk to him alone.
                                                                    (CONT)

      The attorneys get up and leave. Richie takes their place.
      Frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile
      from the courtroom. Richie offers nothing.

                                FRANK
                   I just heard something. I said it
                   couldn't be true. You didn't really
                   turn in a million dollars you found
                   in the trunk of a car, did you?

      Richie doesn't say. Frank searches his face for some clue
      to where on earth he's from.

                                FRANK
                   Want me to tell you what happened to
                   it? It ended up in cops' pockets.

                                  RICHIE
                   Maybe.

                                FRANK
                   Maybe? No. It did. All you did was
                   give it to them for nothing in return.
                   Not nothing: You got their contempt.

      Frank studies him.

                                FRANK
                   Why'd you do that? What're you trying
                   to prove, you're better than them? You're
                   not better than them. You are them.

                                RICHIE
                   I don't have the time or interest to
                   listen to (this) -

                                FRANK
                   You did it because it was right.
                   That's all. Why's that hard to say?
                   The question is would you do it again?
                   That was a long time ago. It'd be very
                   easy to find out. Tell me you want to
                   find out, tell me the address, and a car
                   will be there, the trunk loaded.

      Richie knows Frank isn't kidding ...

                                  RICHIE
                   No, thanks.

      Frank suddenly explodes -


                                                                       (CONT)

                                FRANK
                   Who the fuck are you to say no to
                   that? You think that impresses me?

      Guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the
      outburst is through. Richie remains serene. Eventually -

                                FRANK
                   Let me ask you something. You think by
                   putting me in jail, you're going to stop
                   even one junkie from dying? Because you
                   won't. If it isn't me, it'll be someone
                   else. With me or without me, nothing's
                   going to change.

                                RICHIE
                   Then that's the way it is.

                                FRANK
                   You have any sort of case? Or just
                   that idiot drives for my brother. Is he
                   your case? Because if it's just him and
                   the powder, it's not enough.

                                RICHIE
                   Then you got nothing to worry about.

      But Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't
      take money sitting placidly in front of him.

                                FRANK
                   My brothers won't talk to you. My
                   cousins. None of my family. No one but
                   that mother fucking driver.
                                RICHIE
                   I got more than that. I got a line of
                   people wanting to testify that stretches
                   out the door and around the block.

                                FRANK
                   Bullshit.

                                RICHIE
                   Is it? Tony the Bug.     Benny Two-Socks.
                   Carmine Camanetti.

                                FRANK
                   Who the fuck are they? I don't know
                   them and they don't know me.

                                FRANK
                   This is who you're going to put on the
                   stand? Guys who don't know me? Who got
                   nothing to do with me?

                                RICHIE
                   They have everything to do with you.
                   And the only thing they hate more than
                   you is what you represent.

                                FRANK
                   I don't represent nothing.

                                RICHIE
                   You don't? Black businessman like you?
                   Of course you do. But once you're gone,
                   things can return to normal.

                                FRANK
                   Look at me. You looking? Can you tell
                   by looking it would mean nothing to me if
                   tomorrow you turned up dead?

                                RICHIE
                   Get in line. That one stretches around
                   the block, too.

      Frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life.
      He wants to work something out with Richie obviously, but he
      can't figure out how. Frank studies him.

                                FRANK
                   What can we do?

                                RICHIE
                   You know what you have to do.                             

      Frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can            
      do it.                                                                 

                                FRANK                                        
                   I could give you cops, but that's not                     
                   who you want, is it. You want organized                   
                   crime names.                                              

                                RICHIE                                       
                   I'll take them, too.   I want them all.                   

                                                                    (CONT)

                                                                    123.

      Frank isn't sure he heard right.                                       

                                FRANK                                        
                   You'll take them, too? You'd go after                     
                   cops? Are you serious? You'd do that?                     
                   Lock up your own kind?

                                RICHIE
                   They're not. Not the ones in business                     
                   with you. They're not my kind any more                    
                   than the Italians are yours.

      They regard one another in silence.      Richie can tell Frank
      sees daylight.

                                FRANK
                   What can you promise me?

                                RICHIE
                   I can promise you if you lie to me about
                   one name, you'll never get out of prison.
                   Lie about one dollar in one offshore
                   account, you'll never get out. You can
                   live rich in jail the rest of your life,
                   or poor outside it, that's what I can
                   promise.

      Frank is silent for several moments.      Finally -

                                FRANK
                   You know, I don't care if the feds take
                   all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore
                   accounts. They can take it all, I don't
                   care - use it to build battleships, paint
                   bridges, whatever the fuck they want.
                   Fight another war. But those other
                   motherfuckers - the cops - put my money
                   in their pockets. Millions.

                                RICHIE
                   I believe it.

      Frank debates with himself the step he's about to take ...

                                RICHIE
                   I want to know everyone   you've met for                  
                   the last twenty years.    Everyone you sold               
                   to. Every cop you ever    paid off. Every                 
                   one who ever stole from   you. Every one
                   you remember.

                                FRANK
                   Oh, I remember them all.   That's not the
                   problem.

                               RICHIE
                   What is?

                                FRANK
                   The jail's aren't big enough.

344   INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL / STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY              344

      Surveillance photographs of cops seen earlier taking
      envelopes of money on 116th Street and other drops go up
      on a new, elaborate Table of Organization - of cops.

345   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY                         345   

      Richie dismantles the Lucas Table of Organization here,
      taking down the photographs. As it collapses -

346   INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - CONTINUED                              346

      Frank puts up photographs of detectives -

347   QUICK CUTS of the same detectives, in handcuffs, led through
                                                              347
      police stations past other cops watching with dread like
      maybe they're next -

      A surveillance photograph of the four Princes of the City
      striding down a sidewalk goes up on the cell wall -

348   FLASHCUT as three of the four SIU cops are led away in cuffs
                                                              348
      from a golf course -
349   A surveillance photograph of Trupo in a black hand -           349

                                FRANK
                   You go up here. Your "special."

      As Frank tapes the picture of Trupo at the top of the
      pyramid of corruption -

350   INT/EXT. TRUPO'S GARAGE - MORNING                              350

      Trupo, coffee in hand, comes into his garage from his
      kitchen. Opens the garage door and sees two squad cars
      parked outside ...

351   A TV: A report on the indictments handed down by the    351
      Manhattan DA's office against 53 NYPD and SIU detectives -

                                                                  125.
                            




352   INT. PRISON CELL - DAY (YEARS LATER)                          352

      Frank gathers his few personal belongings and puts them in
      a box. Stands with the box and waits for the cell door to
      open. The Table of Organization and files are gone.

      Legend:   Frank Lucas was convicted of Conspiracy to
                Distribute Narcotics and sentenced to 70 years.
                He served 15 of them.

      Legend:   Federal authorities confiscated over 250 million
                dollars from him in real estate, equities and cash
                in US and foreign banks.

353   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY                        353

      Richie, too, is packing, putting personal items into boxes.

      Legend:   The day after he convicted Frank Lucas and 30 of
                his Country Boy relatives, Richard Roberts borrowed
                $400 from his credit union to help pay for a 3-day
                vacation to the Bahamas.

      Richie, carrying the box, switches off the lights and closes
      the door behind him on his way out.

      Legend:   Six months later, he quit the Prosecutors Office
                to become a defense attorney. His first client was
                Frank Lucas.

354   EXT. PRISON - DAY (1990)                                      354

      Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but
      the cardboard box in his arms. Looks out across the parking
      lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up. Sees Richie
      by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag.

355   EXT. 116TH STREET, HARLEM - DAY                               355

      The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same
      corner Frank shot Tango. Frank looks up at the street signs
      that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue. Now they say
      116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

                              FRANK
                 Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was
                 wrong with just plain 8th Avenue?

      He considers the street itself. It too has changed. The
      corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.



                                                                  (CONT)

                                                                     126.
                               
355   CONTINUED:                                                      355


                                FRANK
                   I used to sit here with Ana in my old
                   car. She hated it. Now I don't even
                   have a car. Or her.

      Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and
      across the street to where he shot Tango. It isn't a fruit
      stand any more.

                                FRANK
                   Just do what?

                                RICHIE
                   What?

                                FRANK
                   The fuck is that? Just do what?

      It's a Nike store with huge paintings of Michael Jordan and
      the admonition "Just Do It."

                                 RICHIE
                   Sneakers.   Expensive ones.

                                FRANK
                   Who the fuck would buy those?

      A car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past.
      Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at
      the discount emporium.

                                RICHIE
                   Your brothers know you're out?
                                FRANK
                   I haven't talked to them in years. It's
                   better that way. For them. I don't know
                   where they are. Went back to Greensboro
                   when they got out, I guess.

      Richie nods.    Frank looks back at the new storefronts.

                                FRANK
                   What am I going to do now, be a janitor?
                   What do I know how to do? How am I going
                   to live?

                                RICHIE
                   I told you I wouldn't let you starve.

                                FRANK
                   You told me but you can barely take care
                   of yourself.
                                (MORE)
                                                                     (CONT)

355   CONTINUED:                                                      355
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                          (glances to a pay phone on
                           the corner)
                   You know, one phone call, Richie, I could
                   be back in business.

      The look Richie gives him calmly assures Frank if he did
      that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever.

                                 FRANK
                   I won't.   I'm just saying I could.

      He buttons the cuffs of the fake Members Only windbreaker
      Richie bought him off the street.

                                FRANK
                   Thanks for the clothes.

                                RICHIE
                   You're welcome.

      Frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them
      like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy
      pants, bandanas tied around their heads.

                               FRANK
                   Uh-oh. Look out. Here come the
                   gangsters.

      Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one
      of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. The
      gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do
      something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on
      Frank's face, thinks better of it. The others stop.

                                GANGSTA 2
                   What.

      The first one is still staring at Frank, but finally has the
      good sense to let it go.

                                GANGSTA 1
                   Nothing.

      They move on.    Frank glances to Richie.

                                FRANK
                   Every idiot gets to be young once.

      Frank zips up his Members Only jacket, props up the collar
      and points himself in the other direction.

                                FRANK
                   Let's get out of here.

INT. HOUSE - CLOSED EYES                                                                                

A young man's blue eyes slowly open.  A girl moans from the next room.

EXT. STREET CORNER - A LARGE TIRE

turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an
earlier rain. TUPAC SHAKUR blares from inside.

INT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE EYES

They snap wide as the young woman in the next room MOANS
even louder.

EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A WET NIGHT

A slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street
lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD
BRONCO rests in the driveway.

EXT. WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM

TUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by
slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past
the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The
music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.

They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger
hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the
car, another man methodically waits.

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES

The sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for
Danny to sleep. Next to a digital clock that reads
3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.

A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes
scattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner.

The off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's
attention. He sits up and looks through the blinds.

EXT. HOUSE - SAME

Danny SEES a man reach through the broken window and
unlock the door. He quickly. pans to the idling Trans Am.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY

His fearful expression says it all.

          DANNY
Holy shit.

Danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent
bedroom down the hall. He barges through the door.

INT. DEREK'S BEDROOM - A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG

It hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant,
tome-filled bookshelf. The moans, meanwhile, approach
orgasm.

TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head,
a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left
tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age
girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a
BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade.
Danny watches her fuck, only for a second.

         DANNY
(softly)

Der !

Danny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek
forcefully grabs his little brother's arm.

        DEREK
(controlled)

What?

Stacey stops and looks over.  Frustated, she rolls off
Derek and onto her side.

                 STACEY
Fucking pervert, Dan!

          DANNY
There's a black guy outside Der...
breaking into your car.

Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and
quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his
mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and
shoves in a clip.

              DEREK
How long has he been out there?

          DANNY
Not long.

STACEY

Who?


                 DEREK
Nobody. Relax.

Stacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his
black combat boots.

          STACEY
Who's out there, Derek?

          DEREK
Not right now, honey.
     (to Danny)
How many?

                 DANNY
One...I think.

                 DEREK
Is he strapped?

                 DANNY
Hunh?

              DEREK
Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?

                 DANNY
I'm not sure.

              DEREK
Is there a driver?

Danny nods his head yes.

       DEREK
Okay.  Stay the luck here.

                 STACEY
Derek? Be careful.

He looks at his girlfriend and walks off.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME

TIGHT ON DEREK. He walks down the hall. The intensity
on his face is alarming. He stops at the front door and
grabs the doorknob. Before he turns the knob, he peeks
through the eye hole on the door.

EXT. HOUSE - DEREK'S EYE POV

THE BLACK GUARD carelessly turns toward the driveway to
see what's taking his partner so long with the wires.

INT. HOUSE - DEREK AT THE DOOR

The guard has his back to him. Derek goes.

EXT. HOUSE - THE DUEL

Derek throws open the door and the black man standing
guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door. Derek
buries two bullets in his chest.

          DEREK
Fuck you!

The force propels the man six feet backwards.

INT./EXT. BRONCO - THE OTHER MAN

Stunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway
Tranny. Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder. The
car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side
window. He then walks towards the car and fires shot
after shot at it until it disappears.

INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - DARKNESS

Davina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they
were in Vietnam. They meet in the hallway, still not
able to place the direction of the gunfire.

DAVINA

MOM!!!!

                 DORIS
STAY DOWN, HONEY!  DANNY?!

They stay down on the carpet together.

EXT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S POV

From the rain-soaked window he watches Derek face his
wounded prey - crawling on the ground. Sirens sound from
a distance.

                 STACEY (O.S.)
Get down, Danny! Jesus!

TIGHT ON DANNY. His gaze is locked on his brother from
his bedroom window. Derek cocks his piece, points it and
walks toward the man.

TIGHT ON DEREK'S FACE. Eyes blistering.

FADE TO BLACK:

THREE YEARS LATER

EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING

A black man in a suit and tie, ROBERT SWEENEY, goes
through the automatic doors and into the station. He
approaches a DESK SERGEANT. A daily calendar on her desk
reads MONDAY. MARCH 3. 1997.

                 SWEENEY
Captain Rasmussen?

          DESK SERGEANT
Briefing room. Down that hall...third
door on the left.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING

Cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee.
The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged
with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a
thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly
reaches for a file.

RASMUSSEN
All right. Moving on--
(acknowledging)
Good Morning, Doctor.

The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.

                 SWEENEY
Good morning.

          RASMUSSEN
Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
He's Principal over at Venice High and
for some time now he's done a load of
outreach work with gangs...in and out
of the can.

Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.  He sips water and
continues.

          RASMUSSEN
Three years ago a local kid named
Derek Vinyard gets sent up for
murdering a couple of Crips who were
trying to jack his car. Bob taught
Vinyard back in high school and has
followed the case closely.

              YOUNG COP
He was a skinhead, right?

          SWEENEY
Derek was more like...the skinhead.
He and Cameron Alexander.

COP #2

Who?

Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests
Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals
CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view.

          RASMUSSEN
Cammeron Alexander is probably the
biggest writer and distributor of
white power literature in LA County.
He promotes white power bands, writes
reviews, columns, all at the ripe age
of forty.

             YOUNG COP
     (smiling)
He's forty? Jesus.

          RASMUSSEN
Pretty clean record...runs everything
out of his house down by the beach.

          SWEENEY
There weren't any organized white
gangs around Venice before those two
hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
mostly just black and Mexican. But it
was tiny. They hit it off though...
and Alexander hit the jackpot with
Derek.

Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.

          RASMUSSEN
We got some uncut footage here.
Courtesy of NBC.

ON THE TELEVISION--

          REPORTER
Earlier this evening...LA County
Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot
and killed while putting out a fire in
a suspected Compton drug den.

          RASMUSSEN
       (to the group)
This being February of '90.

EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPE

A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands
next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High
Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck,
he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.

          REPORTER
To my right I have Lieutenant
Vinyard's oldest son Derek.
     (to Derek)
How do you feel about all this, son?

          DEREK
How do I feel? How do you think I
feel? It's typical.

                 REPORTER
Typical how, Derek?

          DEREK
Well...look at our country. It's a
haven for criminals. Black...brown...
yellow...whatever.

          REPORTER
So you're saying the murder of your
father is "race" related?

          DEREK
Every problem in this country is
"race" related. Every problem, not
just crime. These problems are rooted
in the black community, the Hispanic
community, the Asian...every non-
Protestant group in our society.
     (then)
Look at the shit. Immigration...
welfare...AIDS...they're all the
problems of the non-white. Look at
the statistics.

          REPORTER
Most of these issues you're referring
to though son are related to--

          DEREK
     (interrupting)
No no no! Don't say poverty right now
cause that's not it. They're not a
product of our fucking environment
either! Minorities don't give two
shits about this country! They're
here to exploit...not embrace.

          RASMUSSEN (O.S)
     (over reporter's question)
When Alexander got his hands on this
segment...he copied it, sent it out
and it became the Gettysberg Address
for hate groups across the country.

BACK TO THE TELEVISION.

          DEREK
Millions of white Europeans came to
this country and flourished within a
generation! A generation! So what
the fuck is wrong with these people?!

          REPORTER
What does any of this have to do with
your father?

          DEREK
Because my father was doing his
fucking job! Saving a nigger
neighborhood he didn't give two shits
about! And he got killed by some drug
dealer who still collects a fucking
welfare check.

Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER
DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as
he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to
the reporter who just stands there, speechless.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME

Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and
he turns it off.

          RASMUSSEN
Vinyard was quietly released from
Chino on Saturday after three and some
odd years. And I think it's something
we might want to keep an eye on for a
few days.

          SWEENEY
I don't wanna be an alarmist. But
payback is out there. I know it is.
And in this particular case...if
Vinyard gets popped...more people will
get popped.

          RASMUSSEN
It's not exactly LAPD policy but I
want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard
for a few days.

          COP #2
(smiling in disbelief)
Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?

                 RASMUSSEN
Just for a few days.

          ANOTHER COP
He doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here,
Captain. You want us to bust him or
protect him?

Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question.

          SWEENEY
I don't think Vinyard's gonna be the
one to start anything. It's his
following.

              RASMUSSEN
Either way...let's keep it low.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - MORNING

PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman
headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that
doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles
north to get a better break on the next set. Danny
watches as he skateboards down the strand.

His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger,
softer Derek.

Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN
WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all
over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M.,
and Adolescents in black. Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver
off to the left. In red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.

CUT TO:

 EXT. VENICE HIGH SCHOOL - THE BIKE CORRAL

 Kids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their
 bikes and head off to class.

 EXT. HALLWAY - TIGHT ON A THRASHED LOCKER

 Danny throws his SKATEBOARD in, slams the door, and turns
 to face LIZZY, a pretty, redheaded freshman.

                                   LIZZY
                  Hi Danny.

                                   DANNY
                  Hey Lizzy.

The two smile at one another as the FIRST BELL RINGS.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - A URINAL

Danny takes a piss. Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't
me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin, is shoved into the
bathroom and he trips into the sink. LITTLE HENRY, a
young black kid, enters with two of his buddies. Danny
zips up and faces them.

                                   LITTLE HENRY
               (to a terrified Daryl)
                 Tellin' Baker I'm fuckin' cheatin'?
                 I've never cheated in my life.

                                  BUDDY #1
                 Beat his ass, Henry!

                                  LITTLE HENRY
                 Why you trippin' on me?

                                  DARYL
                 I didn't say anything, Henry. I
                 swear.

                                  BUDDY #2
                 He's lying, man! I was right there!

Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically
knocks him down with one shot. A bleeding Daryl
struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.

                                  LITTLE HENRY
                 Next time, man.

Danny stares into Henry's eyes and the trio exits. Dannv
helps Daryl back up to the sink. THE SECOND BELL RINGS.

CUT TO:

INT. CLASS - SAME

Kids have just settled into their seats.  Danny walks in 
and tries to be discrete.

          OFFSCREEN VOICE
Vinyard!?

An OLDER TEACHER writes an Algebra problem on the board
for the students to solve.

                 OLDER TEACHER
You're late.

The man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to
Danny.

          OLD TEACHER
But it looks like you got bigger
problems.

          DANNY
     (reading the slip)
Oh, man! Come on. Get a job.

The teacher stares at him.

CUT TO:

INT. PRINCIPAL LOBBY - DANNY

He sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR.
ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the
secretary as she types and talks on the phone.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through
the the crack in the door as his eyes swell.

          MURRAY (O.S.)
I do not have a problem with him as an
individual, alright!?

          SWEENEY (O.S.)
Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate
this kid.

INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION

The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48,
looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray
walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY,
who now has his jacket off.

He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles
in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF.
"Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left
hand corner.

          MURRAY
This paper is a travesty, Bob!
Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights
hero?! You've gotta draw a line.

          SWEENEY
Murray...it says in your syllabus that
they could do their report on any book
related to the struggle for Civil
Rights.

                 MURRAY
Oh come on, Bob!

          SWEENEY
Let me finish! He needs help...I'm
not disputing that. But I read it and
I'm not going to throw him out.

              MURRAY
His brother probably put him up to it.

          SWEENEY
I can guarantee you his brother didn't
have anything to do with it, Murray.

Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.

          MURRAY
Don't let him walk scot-free here.
For his sake...not mine. You might be
all he has left.

Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods.

CUT TO:

EXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENS

Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney.

                       MURRAY
          Thanks, Bob.
                       
                       SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Okay. Get in here, Dan!

Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact.

                       DANNY
          I knew it was you.

                   SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Shut up and get your ass in here!

INT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERS

Before he even gets through the door he's chastised.

                       SWEENEY
          What's it gonna be, Dan?

                   DANNY
          What's what going to be?

                       SWEENEY
          This petty shit you're pullin'.

                       DANNY
          Well...I don't know.

                       SWEENEY
          You said it, all right. Sit down.

Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the
teenager and leans back in his chair.

                       SWEENEY
         Are you okay?

                   DANNY
         Yeah.

                       SWEENEY
         Any time you wanna talk, Dan--

                   DANNY
         Okay.

                       SWEENEY
         How's Derek?

                   DANNY
         Fine.

                 SWEENEY
Adjusting okay?

                 DANNY
Yeah.

          SWEENEY
He was a student of mine. Honors
English. He was a great student...
like you...but he hung out with
scumbags. Also like you. That's why
he ended up in the pen, hunh?

No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper.

          SWEENEY
Great writing. I can't correct it
though. It wreaks too much of shit.

          DANNY
Come on, man! I followed directions
and wrote an "A" paper. It's got
nothing to do with Derek.

          SWEENEY
Everything you do now has something to
do with Derek. Who told you to do
this?

              DANNY
Let us get on with our lives, man!

              SWEENEY
Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he
can take care of himself.  I'm worried
about his little brother.
(softly)
Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!

                 DANNY
Do it. What?  You don't think I could
handle it?

          SWEENEY
     (smiling in disbelief)
The street would kill you, Danny.
You're not tough. The second a
brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll
be holierin' for Doris.
     (pondering to himself)
So here's the drill. Take it or leave
it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm
your history teacher from here on out.
We're gonna deal with shit happening
right now. Call it American
History...X. I see your ass once a
day. Any more, any less, and you're a
memory at Venice High. Clear?

          DANNY
It took me a week to read Mein Kampf.
Come on, Sweeney.

          SWEENEY
My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a
another paper on my desk tomorrow.

              DANNY
What am I doing it on then?

          SWEENEY
It'S not a "what", it's a "who."
         (after a beat)
Derek.

SMASH TO:

EXT. VENICE SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOON

A series of intercuts shows activity in and around the
pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster.
OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia.
A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG
MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and
boxers.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk,
performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit,
recovers, and looks off into the distance.

          DANNY (V/O)
People look at me...and they see my
brother. That's how things have gone
since the murder of our father.

EXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURT

From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot
hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold
glance.

          DANNY (V/O)
Little Henry Hastings and his older
brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline
Crip...Henry's on his way.

Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath
and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips
from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing.

          DANNY (V/O)
Venice Beach, man. It didn't always
look like this. I mean...our Dad used
to take us down here to run...and it
was cool. Derek fucking owned this
place.        Since then though...the gangs,
man--

TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he
takes a drag off his Marlboro Red.

          DANNY (V/O)
--they've moved west from Inglewood
and South Central and have really
just...taken over. Especially at my
high school. The Venice Locos are big
too but they hang out in bumluck Mar
Vista. It's scary.
     (then)
And then there's The Disciples of
Christ. The D.O.C.

Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra
players and spectators.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACK

DANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3
blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1
Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his
two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better,
predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has
a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed
on his head.

JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the
court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left
shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON.
Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on
the bleachers.

                 LAWRENCE
Seven-six. Let's go!  Set some picks!

                 SETH
Bring it on, boy.

Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court.

LAWRENCE
Boy?

Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as
he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers.

          SETH
Lucky piece of shit! I'm through
"monkeying" around with your ass!

Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.

           LAWRENCE
Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating,
cracker, motherfucker. A hundred
bucks says I make you my bitch.

          SETH
     (to the crowd)
Here we go! Trying to make ends meet
for that cut in welfare.

He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline.
Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks
at him, concerned.

              DANNY
It's eight-six, Seth.

          SETH
When I want your fucking opinion I'll
ask for it, fuckhead.
     (to Derek and Cam)
Help me cover here, guys.

Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose
and embarrass them.

              CAMMERON
You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.

              SETH
I'll take this negro down.

              DEREK
You can't take a shit, Seth.  Shut up.

Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and
stands. He shouts for all to hear.

                 DEREK
I got a bet.

Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.

          DEREK
I come in, same score now, first one
to eleven. Black boys against the
white boys.

Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.

              LAWRENCE
Name your price, Cracker.

          DEREK
No money...for the court. We win, you
grab your shit and find a different
place to run. Not just today...
forever. You win, and we don't come
back. No hitching, no fighting, here
in front of everyone. Six-eight, our
ball.

The action around the court gets very still.  Finally,
Lawrence nods.


          LAWRENCE
You got a lot of fucking balls, man.
Bring it. Right now.

Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey.
Lawrence gets his team together.

CUT TO:

EXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE

No more mixed assemblage of players.  One team is white, 
one team is black.

A SERIES OF SMOTS

Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek
hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses
his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls
Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a
twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on
two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses
the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane
and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.

                       SETH
          Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.
                                     
SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on
transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches
intently.

                 CAMMERON
It's all you, Der!

                 LAWRENCE
Fuckin' BYU, man!  All right!  All we
need is one now!

Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding
competitive boundary. A look filled with rage.

          CAMMERON
Use that fat ass and keep him out,
Seth!

Seth and the opposing player bang to get position
underneath.

          LAWRENCE
I ain't losin' in my house!  Clear it 
out!

The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court --
his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek
is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is
stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence
inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face,
sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.

              CURTIS
That's fuckin' offense!

          LAWRENCE
Get the fuck outta here!  He was
movin' his feet!

Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.

          DEREK
(threateningly)
I'll go if you want to.

          LAWRENCE
You wanna piece! Bring it!

Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the
teams hate each other.

          DEREK
If you wanna go...I'm ready.  Don't be
throwin' fuckin' elbows.

          LAWRENCE
Fuck you!

Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing
courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting
for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip.
Cameron stares at Derek.

        CAMMERON
Hey.  Are you copacetic?

Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.

              CAMMERON
He's gonna do that 180 spin move.

          DEREK
I know what he's gonna do.

              DANNY
You gotta call offense on that shit.

              DEREK
Not on point game you don't.

          STACEY
Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull
that shit. It's fucking-

              DEREK
Not on point, honey.

He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence.
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in.

DEREK

Tens!

Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and
quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a
marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten
foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT.
Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off
the fast break and DUNKS IT.

          DANNY
         (amazed by the dunk)
Holy shit!

Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the
sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered.
Everyone is riveted on Derek.

          SETH
         (to the other team)
Get off my  fucking court!  This is my
house!

                 DANNY
Yeah! Fuck...yeah!

A sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes
a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his
bitter opponent, and says nothing.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - BY THE COURT

Derek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand
outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the
stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off.

DANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his
sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear,
and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag
reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER.

Derek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny
notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill.
Derek meets their gaze.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - PRESENT - DANNY'S POV

Danny awakens from his daydream. The black players now
stare at him. Danny puts his board down and skates down
the boardwalk.

          DANNY (V/O)
It was only the beginning.
     (then)
Derek once told me that minorities
would take America over one day. That
white people are too afraid. Maybe he
was right.

CUT TO:

EXT. SMALL BEACH HOUSE - A PATIO

Danny skates up to the gate and kicks his board up to his
hand.  He passes two SURFBOARDS on his way towards the
back.

EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - TWO 14-YEAR-OLDS

LIZZY, the redhaired beauty from earlier, and her blond
friend KAMMI, sturable out and laugh. They're stoned.

                 KAMMI
Hey! Danny!

        DANNY
(smiling)
Hey.
              LIZZY
You're going tonight, right?

DANNY
Where?

              LIZZY
That party. Go there.

The two young girls giggle and take off.

INT. TINY, MESSY BEDROOM - SAME

JASON and CHRIS, two 17-year-old skinheads with shaved
heads, prepare to hit the surf. Chris sings to
INSTITUTIONALIZED BY SUICIDAL TENDENCIES on the stereo
while Jason throws on a ZOG T-SHIRT, the tops of their
fullsuits hang down.

                 DANNY (O.S)
There's dick for waves.

              CHRIS
I don't care. I just wanna get wet.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He flips through a book titled TURNER
DIARIES. On the nightstand to his left is a digital
clock that reads 4:47 p.m.

          DANNY
I've been trying to buy this.  You 
can't find it anywhere.

The two look at Dan.

          JASON
Cammeron dropped us off a copy. Dope
fucking shit, man. It's all about
reclaiming the country. I'll let you
read it when I'm done.

              DANNY
Fuck that. I just read Mein Kampf.

                 JASON
There you go.

          CHRIS
Hey? What was this Daryl shit you
were talking about?

          DANNY
Henry Hastings almost kicked Daryl
Dawson's ass. He would're too if--

          CHRIS
Little Henry the negroid?

Danny nods.

          DANNY
Everyday there's something over there,
man.

              CHRIS
Why do you think we fuckin' quit?

                 DANNY
I hear you.

              JASON
Daryl Dawson's a pussy faggot.

CUT TO:

EXT. BOARDWALK - DANNY, JASON AND CMRIS - LATER

The three skateboard down the strand, Jason and Chris
with their surfboardS and suits. Chris looks at Jason's
shirt.

                 CHRIS
What's ZOG again?

                 JASON
Zionist somethin'.

                 DANNY
Zionist-Occupational-Government.

Ahead an OLD ASIAN WOMAN tows a succession of SHOPPING
CARTS. As Jason passes, he smacks her with his surfboard
and knocks her to the ground. They all laugh and Danny
breaks off and heads east on Rose.

CUT TO:

INT. DUMPY APARTMENT - TIGHT ON TEARY EYES

DAVINA VINYARD, in a UCLA T-SHIRT and panties, cries on
the couch as she hugs a LONG HAIRED Derek. DORIS sobs as
she lays under a pink blanket, burdened by the flu.
Shirtless Derek grabs Doris' hand and leans over to kiss
her.

                 DEREK
It's gonna be fine.

EXT. DUMPY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car
across the street. Two plainclothes cops from the
earlier meeting sit in their car and stare from afar.
Danny goes through the gate.

iNT. HOUSE- SAME

Danny walks in on the tearful family conclave.  He stands 
there, wishing the day would just end.

          DANNY
Oh man--! Come on!  What are you
crying about now?

THE PHONE RINGS and Derek rushes down the hall to get it.

          DEREK
I got it.

Danny looks to his mother.

              DANNY
Are you feeling better at all?

                 DORIS
I need a kiss.

Danny wipes away her tears, kisses her, and moves away
quickly so he won't get sick.

INT. BEDROOM - DEREK ON THE PHONE

He listens to the man on the other line.

                       DEREK
          Unhuh. Unhuh. Did you expel him?

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

There's a knock on the front door and Davina answers.
She opens the door and tries to shut it immediately.
SKINHEAD FAT SETH, from the game earlier, wears a GOOD
GUYS STEREO UNIFORM. He pushes the door back open.

                       DAVINA
          What do you want!?

                       SETH
          Open up, bitch!

Davina relents and Seth enters.

                   DAVINA
               (examining him)
          Jesus! Are you sure you can fit
          through the door?

                   SETH
          Fuck off.
               (excited)
          Where is he?

                       DAVINA
          Back in his bedroom.

Seth pushes Danny to the side, passes Doris and yells.

                   SETH
               (smiling)
         Where are you, you free motherfucker?

Seth moves down the hall and bangs on Derek's door.

                   SETH
         Vinyard!

                   DAVINA
         He's on the phone, asshole!

                   SETH
          Fuck off.

              DEREK (O.S.)
I'll be out in a minute!

Without pushing it, Seth undoes his pants and moves into
the bathroom. Danny walks down the hall.

INT. BATHROOM - THE CAN

Seth sits on the toilet. Danny pushes the door slightly
and stares at Seth's GUN on the bathroom counter. Danny
looks at him. After a few seconds--

          SETH
What are you lookin' at?

              DANNY
I'm still trying to figure it out.

          SETH
Come in here and I'll show you,
maggot.

              DANNY
Fuck off. When'd you start carryin'?

          SETH
I'm dropping the kids off at the pool,
junior. Shut the fuckin' door!

Danny grabs his nose and turns to the door behind him.

      DANNY
Jesus!  Chew your food, dude!

INT. BEDROOM - DEREK

He continues into the phone receiver.

                 DEREK
All right. Thanks.  I'll take care of
it. Yeah.

DANNY'S POV. He opens the door and sees Derek on the
phone with his back to him. Above Derek is Danny's
surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling.

Blue jeans, black boots and slicked back hair, Derek
holds his hand up and motions for Dan to be quiet. The
sleeves of tats covering his arms, shoulders and back
(D.O.C.) define the hatred that has engulfed his past.


    DEREK
(into the receiver)
Okay.  Okay. I'm what?  What channel?

He covers the receiver, turns on a ten inch TV, and flips
to the correct channel.

          DEREK
         (without turning)
What is it, Danny?

              DANNY
You got pigs outside.

DEREK

I know.

Derek leans over the computer to check it out.

INT./EXT. BEDROOM - DEREM'S POV

He looks through the blinds and stares at the UNMARKED
CAR. Danny throws his backpack on the bed and exits.

TIGHT ON DEREK. He listens to the television.

          TV ANCROR (O.S.)
Saturday's prison release of a former
skinhead gang leader has many
community leaders up in arms tonight.

INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON SETH

He points his Glock 9mm at the mirror.

          SETH
Drop the t.v., nigger.

He laughs to himself and exits.

INT. HALLWAY - SETH CONTINUED

He bangs on Derek's door once more, pissed that Derek
didn't open it earlier. He heads for the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUE TV ACTION

Danny, Davina, and Doris are glued to the news story on
the same station. Doris, once beautiful, is now aged and
graying. NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION
CONTAINERS, and a spoon rest on the coffee table.

TIGHT ON THE TELEVISION. A WELL-DRESSED BLACK WOMAN
speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story.
Random black protestors nod and comment in the
background.

          BLACK WOMAN
Maybe now whites will understand the
motives behind people like Malcolm X
and the Black Panthers.  Just put the
shoe on the other foot.

FLASH TO:

EXT. CHINO PRISON - THE VINYARDS ON NEWS FOOTAGE

Danny walks' towards Derek and they smile and hug.  Davina
and Doris soon join in.

Davina

          BLACK WOMAN (V/O)
Derek Vinyard deserved the death
penalty for what he did to that young
man! And now he walks the street as
free as you and I.

          DANNY
     {to the tv)
What about OJ, bitch!?

INT. VINYARD HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE TV

The news segment winds down.

          BLACK WOMAN
         (fed up, to the camera)
They've done it to us again.

A hand reaches over to turn the channel. IT'S SETH.
Doris, in an awful state, lays back down.

TIGHT ON SETH. Tattoos cover his forearms. A BLOODY
SNAKE is halfway tucked under his rolled-up sleeves.

          SETH
Nigger lovin' Jew media calling the
shots. Watch cartoons. It's the only
t.v. that's safe nowadays.

              DORIS
No one's safe--until we all are.

Seth looks at the woman like she's from another planet.
He laughs and goes into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - SETH'S POV

He looks through the fridge but finds nothing. He closes
the door and looks at the family pictures on the door.

A FAMILY SHOT of Doris, Derek, Danny, Davina, and DENNIS
VINYARD in front of church. Seth appreciates Dennis in a
coat and tie. Below that, a picture of a dirty and
rugged Dennis and a young Davina, wearing her father's
FIRE HELMET. Danny with Doris.

                       SETH
          Come in here, Dan.

INT. SMALL KITCHEN - SAME

He sits and comes upon Davina's revealing CROTCH. She
studies and so does he. Danny walks in the kitchen and
looks through the fridge. He pulls out a leftover piece
of steak and gnaws on it. Seth looks over at Dan

                       SETH
          Where the fuck you find that?

                       DANNY
          Goin' to Cam's party tonight?

                       SETH
          Is Davina's ass water tight?

Danny laughs.

                   DAVINA
          Hurry up and leave, Goodyear.  You've 
          taken your dump now go.

                   SETH
         Listen to you. You callin' me a
         blimp, you fuckin' Democrat?!

                       DAVINA
          Yes! I am!

Danny takes a bite and laughs at Seth.

                       DANNY
         I'm there tonight.

                   SETH
         Oh yeah? You ask Derek?

                       DANNY
         Noo...but he's got two kegs.

          SETH
Well...you can think of me drinkin'
'em then when you're studying with
fuckin'... White Trash in there.

Davina scoffs and Seth looks up her shirt.

          SETH
Where is the fucker, by the way!?
He's hiding from us.

Davina looks up from her homework and catches the pervert
looking at her.

                 DAVINA
You're not even human.

Seth erupts with laughter.

              DANNY
Is Cam playing sticks?

                 SETH
Of course, man.

Seth drums on the table as Danny shoves the last bite
into his mouth.

          SETH
Sit down. I wanna ask you some
questions.

              DANNY
I got homework, Seth.

          SETH
Two fucking seconds, dude!

Danny sits and looks at Seth.

          SETH
Tell me your convictions.

          DANNY
Fuck off.

          SETH
Tell me some of the shit you've
learned luckbrain or I'll pistol-whip
you.

                 DANNY
About Adolf?

                 SETH
About anything.  What do you believe
in?

Danny thinks to himself and smiles.

          DANNY
I believe in filth and destruction and
chaos and death and greed.

                 SETH
What else?

          DANNY
I believe in my family.

          SETH
Why?
          DANNY
"Respect your father and your mother.
Whoever curses your mother and
father... is to be put to death."
Matthew 15-4.

                 SETH
Good. What else?  Tell me what I want 
to hear, asshole.

              DANNY
You mean that stuff about your mother?

Davina CACKLES in the background.

          SETH
You wanna get beaten?

           DANNY
No.

              SETH
Then tell me about Adolf and Mein.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVINA

She puts down her homework and looks over at Seth.

          DAVINA
Hey Seth? Cut the shit.

          SETH
I'm not fuckin' talkin' to you,
Davina, shut up! Do you believe in
Adolf?

              DANNY
Yeah, man. I believe in Adolf.

Seth smiles at the youth and speaks intimately.

          SETH
What do you hate, Danny?

          DANNY
I hate everyone that isn't white
Protestant.

          SETH
Why? And say it with some fucking
conviction!

          DANNY
Because they're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.  Some
of them are all right--

          SETH
None of them are all right, Danny.
They're all a bunch of fucking
freeloaders.
     (after a beat)
Remermber Canuneron. "We don't know
them, we don't want to know them,
they're the fucking enemy." What
don't you like about them?

                 DANNY
I don't know.  I feel threatened by
them.

          DAVINA
They feel threatened by you!

          SETH
     (ignoring her)
What else, Danny? And speak
intelligently you little queer faggot.

Davina's attention is rapt on her little brother.

          DANNY
I hate the fact that it's cool to be
black these days.

SETH
Good.
          DANNY
I hate this hip hop influence on white
fuckin' suburbia.

SETH

Good!

          DANNY
I hate Hilary Clinton and all of her
Zionist MTV pigs telling us we should
get along. Save the rhetorical
bullshit honey, it ain't gonna happen.

Seth looks at the young man.  He smiles at him with
distinct revelation.

          SETH
That's the best shit I've ever heard
come out of that mouth.

TIGHT ON DAVINA. She stares at the two hate mongers.

              DAVINA
I feel.sorry for you, Danny.

                 SETH
Shut up, Davina.

          DAVINA
You shut up, you poison to fuckin'
society! Get out of our house!

          SETH
     (laughing)
Is this any way to treat a guest?

              DAVINA
Derek hates you, Seth.

              DEREK (O.S.)
How do you know who I hate, Davina?

TIGHT ON DEREM VINYARD - SILENCE.

He's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt
and tats hanging down his arm. A black jacket wraps
around his waist.

                 DAVINA (O.S)
What do you mean?

Seth stands and smiles.

          SETH
Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin' A.
Long time no see. Look at that hair.

Seth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a
reluctant hand instead.

              DEREK
Gimme just one second, okay?

Seth nods as Derek stares at Danny.

              DEREK
Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf?

                 DANNY
What's it to you?

          DEREK
         (ready to kill)
What's it to me?

          DANNY
     (seeing this)
I mean...how'd you find out?

          DEREK
None of your fucking business how I
found out.

              SETH
I thought it was a great idea.

                 DEREK
That figures.  You're more stupid than
he is.

              SETH
It's nice to see you too, man.

                 DEREK
Why'd you do it, Dan?  Because of
Seth.

                DANNY
No.

          DEREK
Cammeron?

              DANNY
I did it cause I felt like it.

          DEREK
Oh, you do everything you feel like?
I feel like smacking you in the
fucking head. Would you mind if I did
a report on that?

                 DANNY
Uhhh...yeah.

          DEREK
Get a clue, you dumbshit. Hey! Look
at me! Don't be a dickhead. Sweeney
cares about you.

              SETH
         (smiling)
Sweeney does?  Since when?

          DANNY
Was that him on the phone?

                 DEREK
Yep. So wise up.  You hear me?

          SETH
Sweeney's a fuckin' nigger on a power
trip, Vinyard. That's what he was
like when we were there and that's how
he is now. It'll never change either.
A nigger is a nigger.

Derek stares at Seth, ready to beat the fuck out of him.
Suddenly, Doris starts in with a COUGHING ATTACK. Derek                                      
quickly fills a glass of water and goes in there.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE PINK BLANKET

She coughs incessantly. Derek sits down beside her,
hands her the water, and caresses her head. The others
stare at her in the background.

              DORIS
Just put me out of my mercy.

          DEREK
You'll be okay. You want me to pick
you up any more medicine?

Together they look at all the bottles and laugh.  Derek
checks out the couch.


          DEREK
Jesus. I can't believe I ever let it
get this bad.

              DORIS
It's not that uncomfortable.

              DANNY
Are you gonna to live or what, Mom?

              DORIS
I need a cigarette.

                   DEREK
         My ass. You smoke two packs a day.
         That's why you're spittin' phlegm.

Doris coughs once again and spits green into her napkin.

SETH
(astonished)
Jesus, Mrs. Vinyard.  I think a lung
just came up.

Everybody laughs -- including Doris.  Derek tenderly puts 
his hand on his mother's cheek.

              DORIS
I'm high as a kite.

                 DANNY
You got any more?

 DORIS
Daniel?  I know you got homework.

              DANNY
I'm goin' in a second.  Relax.

          SETH
     (interjecting to Derek)
Hey. I'm gonna re-wipe and we're out
of here.

Seth laughs as he walks down the hall.

                 DAVINA
You're a pig.

              DORIS
I don't like him in this house.

         DEREK
I knew.

              DAVINA
He ' s a fuckin ' loser, Nazi scumbag.

              DANNY
No he's not.

                   DEREK
          Yes he is. Open your eyes.

Danny looks at Derek and smiles.

                   DANNY
          Whatever, dude. I'm gonna go power
          that shit and I'll see you later.

He pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off.

              DEREK
Not at Cammeron's you won't see me.

          DANNY
     (turning back)
Come on, Der! It's gonna be fuckin'--

                   DEREK
          Forget it, Danny! It ain't gonna
          happen for you tonight.

Danny walks off, frustrated. He crosses Seth's path,
gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it's an
everyday occurrence. Seth moves out the side window and
climbs out.

                   SETH
          Hurry up. I'm starving.

                       DAVINA
         What else is new?

Derek nods, looks at his mother and kisses her on the
forehead.

                 DEREK
I'll see ya.

                 DORIS
Okay. Be careful.

DEREK

I will.

Derek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW and goes down the
alley.

INT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS

She thinks to herself and closes her eyes.

EXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK

Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the
passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives
away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE
SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted
windows, it cruises past the apartment complex.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK

CUT TO:

Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework.

                       DANNY
         This sucks.

He walks back out of his bedroom.

INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DANNY'S POV

He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch.
Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep.

                   DANNY
         Hey.

          DAVINA
Hey what?

          DANNY
Come here.

DAVINA

What!?

          DANNY
Come here for a second!

The scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently
follows him down the hall.

INT. BEDROOM - TWO SINGLE BEDS

She sits on the edge of DANNY'S bed.  Danny hands her his
assignment instructions.

              DAVINA
I got shit to do, Dan.

                 DANNY
Just read it.

She sighs and begins to read it out loud.

          DAVINA
"American History X? Take home paper
as assigned by Principal Robert
Sweeney?"
     (to Danny)
Why is he giving you homework? What
happened to Murray?

                 DANNY
Asshole turned me in.

DAVINA
Why?

          DANNY
Just read.

          DAVINA
"Describe in detail your opinion of
-the historical event that took place
in the early morning of October 4th,
1993." What's that?

              DANNY
The night Derek wasted those guys.

Davina takes a moment.

                 DAVINA
Sweeney gave you this?

DANNY

Yep.

          DAVINA
     (continuing her reading)
"Before and after...how has this event
helped or hurt your present
perspective concerning life in
contemporary America. Use the
standard five paragraph format, blab
blab blah--this'll be good for you..

              DANNY
Nooo...it'll be good for you.

She stares at him for a good three seconds.

                 DAVINA
Eat me, Dan.

          DANNY
Come on! Dick Nixon's playin' at
Cammeron's tonight. You owe me.

          DAVINA
I'm not doing your homework for you!
I gotta spreadsheet due!

          DANNY
Goddammit!

Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.

          DAVINA
What's the matter with you? You wanna
be a fuckin' loser your whole life?

Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.

                 DANNY
Asshole Sweeney.

He slowly begins to strike the computer keys. The screen
reads "People look at me and they see my brother. That's
the way things have gone since the murder of our father,"

TIGHT ON DANNY.  The frustated kid sits and thinks to himself.
himself.

QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK


THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In
the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group
of skins gathering.

          DANNY (V/O)
It was lunacy after he left us. All
the time. Derek believed in
Cammeron...he was angry...that
combination gave them bodies. White
punks...sick of gettin' their asses
kicked by black and mexican gangs at
school.

TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR.

Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait.

DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with
Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO.
Stacey leans in from the backseat.

              STACEY
I hope you kill that fucker.

Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron.

                 CAMMERON
He might have a gun.

          DEREK
Are you going in or not?

          CAMMERON
You know I got the cops on me. If I
come up on one of those cameras I'm a
dead man.

Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.

              CAMMERON
Somebody needs to drive, Derek.

          DEREK
     (referring to his mouth)
All right. You can turn it off now.
     (back to Stacey)
You're right on his tail, right?

          STACEY
     (nodding)
I hate that fucking Korean.  I hope
you smash his face in.

              DEREK
Just be ready, okay?

She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.

          DEREK
Come on. Let's pull it together.
Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games
here. Let's go.

The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with
the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint
and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the
crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the
ground.

          DEREK
What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin'
nigger now? Want some crack?

CURTIS
No.

          DEREK
     (grabbing his neck)
Pull your fucking stupid head out of
your ass then.

                 CURTIS
Okay. Jesus.

          DEREK
     (to the group)
We're here tonight cause we got
immigration problems spiralling out of
control. We got Asians up the ass...
taking over our land with their
fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into
this place like some giant fucking
Pinata was shattered.

The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.

          DEREK
Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the
Statue of Liberty it says "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor,
your huddled masses...yearning to be
free." It does not say give me your
shiftless, your greedy, your indolent,
your criminals, looking for a free
ticket.

The group agrees.

          DEREK
We're here tonight to show the
government how we feel about
minorities taking over our country.
The treat us like criminals while they
reward them with jobs and fucking
welfare checks. And it's only getting
worse.

              ET AL
(nodding)
Fuck yeah it is.

          DEREK
Are you ready to do something about
it?                                   

ET AL
Yeah.

          DEREK
Okay then.

AND THEY'RE MOVING.  In formation.  Fast.  Directly at
us.    Angry.

As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek
reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING
MASK. He pulls it down over his face.

The foot soldiers follow him in unison.

          DEREK
         (back to his troops)
Remember. No names. Danny?  Stay
right on my fucking ass, man.

And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA
SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.

EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME

They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in
there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a
Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth
catches up to another and gets him on the ground.

          SETH
Wheto's your fucking green card,
asshole?

Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot
and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman
alone like she's not even there and pushes over an
adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF
BEANS.

          DEREK
(referring to the border)
Can't hide from me, motherfucker!

He kicks the man and looks around the market for more.
Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar
over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a
shelf of POTATO CHIPS.

DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors.

INT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER

He rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and--
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S
HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like
he's Superman.

Derek looks to his watch and straightens up.

              DEREK
Let's go! We're outta here!  Move !

From just inside the door we see skins get in their last
blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the
doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE
OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR;

INT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY

He takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone-
faced brother.

          DANNY (V/O)
And before Derek could even blink...he
had a crazed army behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - PRESENT - THE COMPUTER

Danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen.

          DANNY (V/O)
Willing to follow his word like it was
the word of God.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK

As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the
table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then
boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey
sits close to Derek.

          DANNY (V/O)
And then came October 4th, 1993.

INT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM

Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard,
shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away.

          DANNY (V/O)
Things were fine on the homefront. My
Mom had a good job but a below average
boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom
house that Dad left us with. Everyone
was happy.

TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos,
loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His
charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the
crackling rainfall.

                 DANNY (V/O)
Everyone but Derek.

          DEREK
Fuck you, Murray. White men don't
cruise the streets of LA killing each
other.

         MURRAY
No.  You guys make bombs.

Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.

          DEREK
You're so fucking lame. A couple of
cranks in cabins in Montana is not
statistically significant.
     (then)
White Americans don't take PCP and
drink and drive a hundred and twenty
fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over
and trust the law.

                 MURRAY
You're kidding, right?

          DAVINA
     (sarcastically)
Don't you know, Murray? White people
never break the law. We're perfect
little angels.

          DEREK
That's not what I said, Davina.
     (to the group)
Three different times Rodney King
comes at those officers with the
intent to hurt them. To hurt them!
Three times! But since we see it on
some fucking tampered videotape...the
bleeding heart media makes you believe
that he only comes at them once. All
we see is Powell, Koon and Wind
hittin' him and--
     (busting up laughing)
Briseno kickin' him in the back of the
fuckin' skull with his boot. Still,
the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and
kick their asses! That's how stupid
that motherfucker is. Those cops used
textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were
still here he'd say the same damn
thing.

          DORIS
That doesn't make it right.

          DEREK
Yes it does. Yes it does. They're
cops! They are taught to use that
stick and they did.

                 MURRAY
Excessively.

          DEREK
No. Appropriately. Appropriately!
Cops have been granted a certain
amount of authority by society and
white people, unfortunately, are the
only ones who acknowledge it. I
acknowledge a cop's authority.

Davina starts to laugh.

          DAVINA
Look who's talking about respecting
the law? Mr. K.K.K. here.

          DEREK
That's two errors in one sentence,
Davina, so take a fucking course in
semantics. First error--I didn't say
I respect the law. I said I respect a
cop's authority. Second error...I'm
not a member of the fuckin' low rent,
disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan..
Pull your head outta your ass and look
at who you're dealing with.

             MURRAY
Don't speak to her that way, Derek.

          DEREK
Murray, stay out of it. You're not a
member of this family and you never
will be.

          MURRAY
What the hell does that have to do
with anything?

          DORIS
     (to Derek)
You know...sometimes it's hard to
believe I gave birth to you.

          DEREK
Give thanks to the food on the table
and then believe it, Doris.

              DORIS
We both put food on this table, fella.

          DEREK
True enough. The point is...if Dan
was walking across the street that
night and Rodney King plowed into him--

          DORIS
Can we forget about Rodney King for
chrissake?!

          DEREK
     (fiercely continuing)
--while hopped up on Chivas and
P.C.P...you'd consider the force those
cops used to be justified!

              DORIS
He didn't hit anybody!

          DEREK
If he did though! If that shithead
killed Dan...you would have believed
the beating to be justified and so
would everybody else. But since he
didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across
America" for the son of a bitch.

Derek takes a bite of food.

          DEREK
We are still so hung up in this notion
that we have an obligation to help the
struggling black man and all you
contribute to it! Lincoln freed the
slaves a hundred and thirty years ago!
Get off your fucking asses!

          STACEY
I'm with you, honey. All the way.
It's one...giant...ploy.

                 DAVINA
Here we go.

          STACEY
I mean...nobody likes Chief whatever
his name is, right?

DAVINA
Gates.

          STACEY
Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece
of garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls
over in front of a perfectly lighted
area where a video camera is sitting
there...fucking waiting for him, man.
What happens next? Chief Gates is
dust. It's total--

Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter
and looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.

          DAVINA
     (to Doris)
May I be excused please?

          DEREK
Don't interrupt, Davina.

          DAVINA
I didn't interrupt shit.

          DEREK
The hell you didn't. I was listening
to Stacey and then I heard you.
That's called interrupting. Wait 'til
she's finished and you can be excused.

              DAVINA
Who the hell do you think you are?

Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back
of the hair.  The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe
floor.                                                           

              DEREK
You don't know when to shut up.

                 DORIS
Dammit Derek!

              MURRAY
What are you trying to prove, man?!

Derek turns and laughs at Murray.

          DEREK
I'm trying to teach my sister some
respect, Murray.

          DAVI NA
Let go of my fucking hair!

          DEREK
     (to Murray)
See! See the way she speaks! Tell me
you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.

          DORIS
Derek!  Let go of her hair and sit
down!

          DEREK
I will when I hear an answer, Doris.
Are you going to shut up, Davina?

TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull
Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with
a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal
vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing
Danny's head.

MURRAY

Jesus!

          DEREK
     (to Danny)
What are  you thinkin'?

 DORIS
 Danny?!  Are you okay?!

Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.

          DEREK
It's a real easy question, Davina. A
simple yes or no will suffice. Tell
me what I want to hear and I'll let
go.

                 DAVINA
Fuck...you.

Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and
shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside
so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on
the meat.

          MURRAY
She can't breathe, Derek!

                 DEREK
Stay back, both of you!  It's her bed,
she's gotta lie in it.
         (grabbing harder)
You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm
not gonna let go until you tell me
what I wanna hear! Are you going to
shut that fat fucking mouth of your's
and let my girlfriend tell her
opinion? Are you?!

DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises
his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother.
She grabs his arm though, forcefully.

              DORIS
Let go of her hair and get out.

Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the
roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back
bedroom crying, choking and coughing.

          DAVINA (O.S)
I hate you, you fucking asshole!

The door slams shut in the background.  Doris, Murray,
Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek.  Derek calmly faces
his brother.

          DEREK
You okay?

Danny nods.

             MURRAY
         (softly)
Psycho.

IN SLO MO--Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head
back to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being
typed and then silence. A cigarette sizzles.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY THINKING - PRESENT

He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He
slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at
the past.

BACK QUICKLY TO:

INT. DINING ROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK - FLASHBACK CONT.

Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief.

          DEREK
Would you care to repeat that, Murray?
I'm not sure I got all of it.

          STACEY
     (smiling)
He called you a "psycho", honey.

          DEREK
     (smiling back)
Was that it?    Thanks Murray.

          MURRAY
See. Here we go again with this,
Derek. Making me out to be the bad
guy again.

              STACEY
You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?

                 MURRAY
(to Stacey)
Hey goddammit! You talk to me with
respect or--!



          DEREK
Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna
do? Give her fucking detention?

                 DORIS          
Both of you get out right now.

Murray stares at Derek with pity.  Doris becomes
emotional.

         DORIS
     (to Derek)
Do you think you're the only one who's
affected around here?

Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated
Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.

          DEREK
Out of respect for my mother...I'm
gonna let that comment go, Murray. I
won't bash your face in. But let me
tell you somethin'...man to fuckin'
mouse here. Normally in a situation
like this I'd take my steel-tips to
your fucking Jewish temple. That goes
for anyone making comments about me,
my family, Stacey, whomever. You know
and I know that I could crush that
puny fuckin' skull of yours in a
second. So it's beyond me why you
would say something like that without
being able to back it up? What's
worse, you sack of shit, is you
calling the woman I love a liar.

              MURRAY
I never said she was a liar.

          DEREK
Weasel like that again Murray...you
fuckin' ponytail, pussy, bagel eating,
teacher, faggot...and I'll cut your
shylock nose off. Make no mistake.

Murray silently walks out of the house. Derek claps and
sings the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila." Stacey
joins in and the two laugh. Doris goes after Murray.

              STACEY
Murray Rosenberg...International Jew.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Murray goes to his car and Doris follows.  Danny watches
from the door.

          DORIS
He's a stupid kid, Murray!  I'm sorry!

          MURRAY
He's not a kid, Doris. We were kids.
We didn't call people kikes.

          DORIS
It's just gonna take some time with
him. What can I do?

          MURRAY
You don't know your children, Doris!
You have no clue about the world they
live in. Your son is a terrorist.

              DORIS
He's not a terrorist, Murray.  Jesus!

          MURRAY
He's a member of the Disciples of
Christ. You remember that grocery
store incident?!

DORIS

Murray?

          MURRAY
My sister and her two kids got
evacuated from her Temple in Woodland
Hills!

          DORIS
Murray! Please! Derek would never
have anything to do with bombs, okay?!
You don't know him like I do.

                       MURRAY
          And I wouldn't want to. Goodbye.

Murray gets inside and goes down the street.

INT. HOUSE - SAME

DANNY'S POV -- He watches Doris stand alone, her face in
her hands, crying.

BEHIND Dan a humiliated Davina storms towards Derek, now
wielding a BASEBALL BAT.

DANNY

Davina?

Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye.
He spots her at the last moment.

         DAVINA
Take this, you fucking dick!

Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close.

          DEREK 
Davina!  It's okay!  Calm down.  
Please.

                 DAVINA
Fuck you! Let go!

          DEREK
         (whispering in her ear)
I'm sorry, Davina. Come on.

                 DAVINA
Let go of me!

                 DEREK
Come on, Davina.  I'm sorry. I lost
control. Please.  I screwed up.

Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down.
He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments
before by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over
and over. Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around
him. Derek looks to Danny.

          DEREK
     (hugging Davina)
You guys are my life and I'd do
anything for you. You do know that?

          DAVINA
     (wiping her tears)
I don't believe you anymore.

          DEREK
I swear to God I would, Davina.
Please.

              DANNY
I believe you, Der.

Derek smiles at his little brother, lovingly.

          DEREK
Davina? Please forgive me.  Please.
I'm sorry.

          DAVINA
     (nodding, after a beat)
That fuckin' sucked, Derek.

          DEREK
I know it did. And I'm sorry.
I just really hate that guy.

                 DAVINA
You couldn't tell.

A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door.

          DORIS
Find an apartment because I want you
out of here.

              DEREK
Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's--

          DORIS
I don't wanna hear it anymore!  I want
you out!

              STACEY
He can move in with me.

               DORIS
When?

          STACEY
Tomorrow.

           DORIS
Good.

She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT

He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The
two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the
car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down.
From the other room, he hears Doris break into another
coughing fit.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY

He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water.

DANNY
Here.

                 DORIS
Thank you, honey.

She coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away.

                 DORIS
Hey. Come here.  Sit with me.

          DANNY
I've got this thing to do.

              DORIS
You can sit down for two seconds.

He looks at her and sits beside her.

                 DANNY
Don't breathe on me.

DORIS
I won't.

They share a smile.

          DANNY
It's cold in here, no wonder your
sick.

She stares and smiles at him for a few moments.

DANNY
What?

          DORIS
What? I'm not allowed to look at you
anymore?

He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly.

                 DANNY
No. You're not.

          DORIS
     (laughing)
Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you
ever gonna let that beautiful hair
grow back?

                 DANNY
Nope. Never.

                 DORIS
I bet you will.

He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several
moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room.

                 DANNY
Get some sleep.

          DORIS
If you need me to proof anything for
you I will.

                 DANNY
I'll be all right.

              DORIS
Wake up early if you get tired.

Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant
thoughts creeping back slowly.

INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DANNY

He grabs a flannel and throws it on. He sees a cigar box
that rests on the right shelf. He grabs it and looks
inside. The rolled-up LA TIMES clipping reads "Prominent
Skinhead Charged with Murder." The accompanying picture
of Derek is near evil.

TIGHT ON HIS EYES.  Danny stares at the clipping.  ON THE
TRACK--GUNSHOTS.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM WINDOW - THE EYES - FLASHBACK

He watches Derek fire his gun at the TRANS AM as it
blazes down the street. He walks over to the wounded man
on the lawn and points his weapon.

                 STACEY (O.S.)
Get on the floor, Danny!  Jesus!

Danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room.

EXT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON DEREK

He hovers over big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he
kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed
against teeth.  Hot air flows from Derek's breath and
into the cold.

                       DEREK
          You fucked with the wrong bull.

                       LAWRENCE
          Goddamn, man!

Danny watches his brother from the front porch.

                       DANNY
         Let the cops handle it, Der!

          DEREK
Fuck that. The cops will let him
walk.

Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the CURB.

          DEREK
Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck?
     (then)
Open your mouth and put it on the
corner of the curb. I'm gonna teach
you a little lesson.

                 DANNY
Derek!?

              DEREK
Get in the fucking house, Dan!

Danny doesn't move.

              LAWRENCE
Come on, man. Call an ambulance.

          DEREK
My dad gave me that truck,
motherfucker. Couldn't leave well
enough alone. Put your mouth on the
corner of the fucking curb!

Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth
now scraping concrete. SIRENS sound from afar. Danny
walks out into the middle of the street to check it out.

DANNY
The cops are comin' Der'
                            

Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his
outstretched mouth.

          DEREK
What the fuck did you say?  You just
threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?

        DANNY
(anticipating)

No!

Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE'S head -
completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner.

             DANNY
     (crying)
Holy fucking shit!  Derek!    What the
hell was that for?!  Jesus!

The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter
lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT.

DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw
their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun
down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his
knees. His eyes are remorseless.

          DANNY (V/O)
Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder
is always with us. It's almost an
institution." That couldn't rang more
true than with me.

CUT TO:

EXT. WET STREET - THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES, and a
throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of the
house. Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from
the house by two uniformed cops and RASMUSSEN.

          DANNY (V/O)
Bobby Lawrence died of massive head
trauma early that morning.

Derek marches past the bodies -- which are being tended
to thoroughly.

          DANNY (V/O)
Six months after that...Derek was
convicted and sentenced to seven years
for voluntary manslaughter...to be
served at the California State
Penitentiary in Chino.

Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the
car. He stares at his brother and sister as police
lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a
lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes
off down the street.

          DANNY (V/O)
Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
brother's torture method...but there
wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence.

CUT TO:

OMIT

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S EYES

They clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the
sentence "There might have been if I testified." Only
when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He
continues typing.

                   DANNY (V/O)
               (continuing)
          Over the next year we'd lose our house
          and the rest of our father's pension
          to attorney fees. My mother...much to
          all of our surprise...stood by Derek.

Danny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV

He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND
JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door.

                 JASON
We're here, dude.

              CHRIS
Drop your dick and grab your stick.

          DANNY
I told you I can't tonight.

              DORIS (O.S.)
         (from the couch)
Danny?

                 DANNY
It's okay, Mom.

The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards 
back to his bedroom.  He shuts his bedroom door.

INT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME

Danny looks at the two.

              DANNY
If I don't finish this thing I'm dead.

              CHRIS
Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow.
You can't miss the party.

              JASON
Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to 
grab your ass.

              DANNY
She did?

                CHRIS
             (nodding)
You gotta hit that shit.  It's the 
only fun thing that's legal anymore.

The PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it.

                DANNY
Hello?

INT.  DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY

The only illumination shines through the window from the 
street.  Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk
phone, all packed up and almost out the door.

              SWEENEY
Dan?

                DANNY (O.S.)
Yeah?

                SWEENEY
Dr.  Sweeney.

INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION

                DANNY
             (worried)
What's going on?


          SWEENEY
Nothing here. Is everything all right
over there?

                 DANNY
Everything's fine.

                 SWEENEY
How's it comin'?

          DANNY
I'm doing it right now.

                 CMRIS
Who is it, dude?

          DANNY
         (covering the receiver)
It's Sweeney.

          CHRIS
Who?! Why is he calling here!?  Fuck
you, Sweeney! Asshole!

          JASON
(grabbing the receiver)
Get a fucking job, you reggie!

Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends.

          DANNY
You fuckers are going to get me
booted!
     (into the receiver)
Dr. Sweeney? I'm sorry, man.

          SWEENEY
Just make sure it's on my desk
tomorrow, Danny.

          DANNY
It'll be there, alright!?

                 SWEENEY
It better be.

Sweeney hangs up abruptly. Danny slams the phone on the
hook, gives it TME FINGER, and looks at his friends.

          DANNY
Let's go.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

A TRUCK sits across the street.

INT. TRUCK - DEREK AND SETH

They sit in the car as a band JAMS from Cam's house.
Shiftless Seth throws on a black CRO-MAG t-shirt and
tosses his work shirt in the back. He wolfs down a
burger as Derek rolls his foot on a basketball on the
floor.

              SETH
You're an idiot if you ask me.

              DEREK
I'm not asking you.

          SETH
What if he writes something stupid and
that nigger turns you in? Jesus. He
didn't testify, Der. They can use
that shit and re-try you.

Derek takes a long stare at Seth, who devourshis burger.

          DEREK
Sweeney's not gonna do anything, Seth.
He helped get me released.

Seth is a pathetic vision to Derek.  Derek stares at him
for several moments.

                 DEREK
I'm out, Seth.

Seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with Derek.

          DEREK
I'm only going to tell you this once
so pay attention. I'm done, Seth. I
don't want you to come near me...near
Dan...I want you to leave my family
alone.

Seth stares and laughs at Derek.

                 SETH
You're serious.

          DEREK
I'm dead fucking serious. No more
phone calls, no more visits, no more
nothing.

Seth doesn't know what to say.

          DEREK
We don't exist as far as you're
concerned, Seth.

          SETH
I can't believe I'm hearing this shit
come out of your mouth.

          DEREK
Believe it, Seth. Believe it. I
spent over three years away from my
family. My family, Seth. For what?

          SETH
For your country, fuckhole, that's
what. I'd do a hundred years before I
felt like that.

Seth gets out, slams the door, and walks to the party.

                       SETH
          You're a motherfucking traitor!

Derek stares out the window and sighs.

EXT. STREET - DEREK'S POV

He watches the house. Suddenly, Danny, Chris and Jason
skate up to the residence and follow Seth inside.

                 DEREK
What the--? Shit.

INT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE - THE FRONT DOOR

CUT TO:

DICK NIXON plays a punk version of WHITE CHRISTMAS as
skins slam dance.

EXT. CAMMERON'S BACK PATIO - A SKINHEAD

His face is tattooed with crow's feet and prison ink.
CASSANDRA, a frail, older, English woman with green hair
and multiple piercings, approaches JASON at the keg.

                 CASSANDRA
You're full of shit!

              JASON
If he ain't here, he's comin'.

INT. HOUSE - MORE SLAMMING

Chris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a
picture of O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the
kids. Derek walks in.

         CHRIS
Yo!  What's up, Fat Seth!?

Seth throws Chris against the wall.

          SETH
I'm not fat, cockwart!  I'm husky!

              CMRIS
Okay! I'm sorry, bro!

                 DANNY
Take it easy, dude!

Seth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt.  Chris and Jason
stare at him like he's gonna hurt him.

                 DANNY
What're you doin'?!

              DEREK
Your brother's a piece of shit!

Seth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny. Seth mixes
into the party and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins.
Danny follows Seth towards the keg.

DEREK'S POV. He analyzes the crowd.  Quickly, Chris
recognizes him.

              CHRIS
Holy shit.  Father Vinyard!?

                 JASON
Son of a bitch.

Derek looks at the two kids.

          JASON
I'm Jason and that's Chris! We're
friends with your brother!

They stick out their hands but Derek prefers to check the
scene.

          CHRIS
You're a fuckin' god, man!

JASON

No shit!

                 DEREK
Do me a favor.  Grab Danny and get
outta here!

The two boys look at each other and LAUGH.

              CHRIS
We just got here, man!

                 DEREK
You what!?

Chris looks at Derek like he's dead.

              DEREK
You don't have any homework?!

              JASON
School doesn't exist anymore, Father.

Derek stares at him, not really knowing what to do.

          CHRIS
I wrote you. Two letters while you
were in there! Did you get them?!

Derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd,
causing many an individual to double-take. Chris and
Jason look on in wonderment.

EXT. LARGE, OPEN SHED AREA - A CROWD

TIGHT ON CAMMERON ALEXANDEr. The older, white trash skin
furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song.
Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika
between his eyebrows like CHARLES MANSON. He wears TROY
AIKMAN'S DALLAS JERSEY and a BLACK COWBOY HAT.

DEREK'S POV. He pans right to check out the crowd. A
man pisses out the window. Then to a distinct woman.

IT'S STACEY. Her head is now completely SHAVED but she's
still gorgeous as ever. Derek indulges her for a few
moments until he turns and walks away.  He bumps into a
girl and knocks her drink.

                 CASSANDRA
Excuse fuckin' me!

DEREK

Sorry.

She smiles at Derek as the SONG comes to a close.

CASSANDRA

Derek?

          DEREK
Cassandra.

          CASSANDRA
Oh my God! They said you might be
here but I didn't fucking believe 'em!

CURTIS, the M-16 on the side of his head perfectly
intact, walks by Derek. He walks past Derek with his
young son on his shoulders.

          CURTIS
I hope what I heard ain't true, man.
You better hightail it the fuck outta
here if it is.

After a moment, Derek looks away and Curtis heads off.

          CASSANDRA
You gotta chop that mop, Der!

Cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette.

          CASSANDRA
     (exhaling)
Stacey's meandering around here
somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!

Derek shakes his head.

              DEREK
The only person I've seen is Seth.

CASSANDRA
Oh God.  I'm sorry.

DEREK'S POV. He sees Cameron puts his arm around her
and kiss her. Cameron sticks his hand down the back of
her pants, smiles, pulls it out, and licks his finger.

Derek watches as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron.  Ca
puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom.
Stacey looks at Derek and follows them.

                 LIZZY (0. S. )
Are you going in there?

Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi.

          LIZZY
Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's
looking for him?

Derek can only stare at the girl's youth.

INT. LARGE BEDROOM/OFFICE - A SHRINE TO HITLER

DEREM'S PoV. He stands in the doorwell and listens.
White Power paraphernalia cover the walls. Articles,
posters, everything. The room has a bed, a couch, a
glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it.
Organized stacks of papers, pamphlets and magazines are
strewn throughout the floor. Cameron sips a beer and
talks with Dan. Stacey listens in the background.

              CAMMERON
He won't do anything'drastic I hope.

              DANNY
I gotta do that paper though.

          CAMMERON
I thought you already turned that
fucker in?

          DANNY
My teacher cried to Sweeney, man.
have to do another one.

Cammeron laughs.

 CAMMERON
Oh man.  Fucking Sweeney.

          STACEY
     (chiming in)
Meanwhile, niggers and spics do their
reports on Malcolm X and fucking Fidel
Castro.

Cameron laughs again but then becomes quickly serious.

          CAMMERON
Sweeney's got an agenda, Danny. And
it's all a load of crap. You hear me?
He's all about brainwashing. Don't
get fucking fooled by it.

              DEREK (O.S.)
What the hell are you doing here, Dan?

They all look over.

          CAMMERON
     (smiling)
Hey. I was wondering when he was
going to show his face.

Derek doesn't lift his eyes from Danny.

          DEREK
What did I tell you, Dan?

              DANNY
I had to check it out, Der.  Come on.

                   CAMMERON
          He'll be all right, Derek.

Derek shoots Cameron a look and tries another way.

                   DEREK
          There's a redhead out there looking
          for you. Go talk to her.

Danny gets up and walks out. Cam looks to Stacey.

                       CAMMERON
         You go with.

Derek seizes his brother with the eyes as he exits.  Then
Stacey.

                 STACEY
Welcome back.

He just closes the door on her.  Cammeron looks for his
cigarettes.

          CAMMERON
You made it, man. When I heard they
threw you in General Population I
thought it was curtains.

              DEREK
It wasn't too bad.

          CAMMERON
So what's all this self-righteous,
born-again shit I'm hearing then?

Derek doesn't blink.  Cameron smiles and points to a
chair.

                 CAMMERON
Have a seat, Derek.  Relax.

TIGHT ON CAMMERON. He sparks up a cigi to break Derek's
uncomfortable stare.

              CAMMERON
How was it in there with all those
fuckin' monkeys, man?  You're lucky
they didn't kill you.

          DEREK
I agree.

                 CAMMERON
Who runs the place?  The monkeys or
the wetbacks?

                 DEREK
The Mexicans.
          CAMMERON
It's a fuckin' vacation for them in
there, hunh?

          DEREK
They were really organized. I'll tell
ya...it was impressive. They--

INT. HOUSE BATHROOM - DANNY AND LIZZY

CUT TO:

The two make out. She sits on the sink and wraps her
legs around him. They stop and smile at each other.

                 LIZZY
I like you.

                 DANNY
I like you, too.

CUT TO:

INT. CAMMERON BEDROOM - SAME

Derek and Cam converse over the coffee table.

                 CAMMERON
They're fuckin' peasants, Derek.  All
of them.
         (then)
So what's up, man? I'm hearing a lot
of shit about you.

          DEREK
Be careful with me, Cam. You don't
know what's going on with me.

              CAMMERON
Fuckin' talk to me then. We're family
here. Let's work it out whatever it
is.
                                  
          DEREK
I'm family, Cam? Is that why you came
to see me all the time up there?

Cameron smiles but doesn't know what to say.

          CAMMERON
I had to distance myself from you
after that.

          DEREK
Fuck you, Cameron. You're a fucking
chicken hawk...praying on kids.

              CAMMERON
I don't pray on fucking anyone.

          DEREK
No. You fucking use them.  To filter
your insanity.

Cameron smiles in disbelief.

          CAMMERON
You and Danny are like brothers to me,
Derek. Come on, man.

          DEREK
He's not your brother, Cameron.  All
right? He's my brother.
     (after a beat)
You hear me, Cam?

          CAMMERON
     (exploding)
Fuck you, Derek! Fuck you! Don't
think you can threaten me with this
shit for a fuckin' second! I'm more
important to him now then you ever
were.

Derek EXPLODES. With his feet, he pushes the GLASS
COFFEE TABLE hard into Cammeron's knees. Cam screams in
agony. Derek SLUGS him in the face and Cam RETALIATES
with two of his own. They wrestle around the room and
push their way into the BATHROOM.

INT. TINY BATHROOM - DEREK AND CAM

Derek takes Cam by his long hair and SMASHES his face
into the mirror. IT SHATTERS. Derek follows with a
solid punch to the kidney.

                 DEREK
You gonna listen?!

          CAMMERON
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

Derek bangs Cam's face against the mirror ONCE MORE.

          DEREK
Shut the fuck up! You're gonna stay
away! That's what you're gonna do!

Derek rinses Cam's bloody face off by PLUNGING it into
the toilet. He pulls him back up and they face the
mirror.

          DEREK
It's over.

Derek stares at him in silence. CAMMERON RETALIATES. He
forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him. He
throws two punches at Derek -- one in the stomach and one
to the face that opens his lip. He misses on his third
and Derek gets the upper hand.

BACK TO THE MIRROR. Derek prepares to crash Cam's face
into the shards of glass one last time. The final blow.
As Cam screams, Derek launches him forward then pulls
back at the very last moment. Derek, noticing Cam's
condition, throws him into the tub.

Derek throws him a towel, grabs one for his lip, and
exits.

EXT. SHED AREA - A GROUP OF 20 NAZI'S

They SALUTE the band and chant as they tune up for
another set. The singer inquires about his DRUMMER.
Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn
the way. Cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random
skins as Derek passes by.

                 RANDOM SKIN
Hey Derek!?

DEREK
What?!

CASSANDRA
(exhaling)
Jesus, Der.  What happened?

CURTIS
(psychotically)
Where's Cammeron, man?!

              DEREK
I haven't seen him.

Cassandra looks at him curiously and then focuses her
attention to the bedroom.

STACEY (O/S)

Hey!

Derek turns around and faces her.

          DEREK
         (pointing his finger)
Stay away from me.

              STACEY
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

              DEREK
I'm serious, Stacey!  Stay away!

She grabs and pulls on his shirt.

          STACEY
What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit
me?! Kick me as I roll on the fuckin'
ground screaming?!
     (then)
That bullshit with Cammeron is
nothing, Derek!

                DEREK
I don't care.

Stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it.

          STACEY
Goddamn you, Derek! Those two niggers
deserved what they got. They deserved
to die! And just like Cameron and
Seth and a million others out
there...I'll believe that 'til the day
I fucking die. I will. Nothing will
ever change that either.

Derek breaks from her grasp and walks away.

EXT. PATIO - DEREM'E POV

He looks over to the kegs. Through the sliding glass
window, he sees Seth taking a "tap hit" off the keg. All
the guys in the b.g., INCLUDING DANNY, count and cheer.
Seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background.
Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the keg.

                 ET AL
Forty-five! Forty-six!  Forty-
seven...!

Seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a
pig. All the guys laugh.

          SETH
     (grabbing Danny)
Why the fuck did you pump it?! I
coulda gone for a minute at least!

Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek.  He
FREEZES while everyone turns to look Derek over.

                 DEREK
Let him go, Seth.

Seth sees blood on Derek's face and shirt and takes a
moment to identify the source. He draws his 9mm Baretta
and points it at Derek's head from four feet away.

                 SETH
Where's Cameron?

Derek stares directly into the BARREL.

          DANNY
(frightened)
Seth, man!? Come on!

Seth puts the gun directly to Derek's cool head.

          SETH
I'd be doing America a great fucking
favor, let me tell you.

                 STACEY
Do it, Seth.

Seth glances at her and Derek quickly GRABS the pistol.
A shot goes off and people hit the deck. Derek wrestles
the pistol away and punches Seth in the STOMACH. Falling
to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face once
more and it's over.

INT. CAM'S BATHROOM - CASSANDRA AND CURTIS

They walk in and look at Cammeron, bleeding in the tub.
Curtis pulls the METAL TOWEL HOLDER off the wall and
storms after Derek. Cassandra laughs.

              CASSANDRA
You got fuckin' guests out there, Cam.

EXT. PATIO - SAME

Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny.

          DEREK
Come with me right now.

He looks at his brother. He then sees Curtis and three
other skins come through the house. Derek stares at Dan
and hauls ass down the back alley.

DANNY'S POV. Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather
than go after Derek. Confused and mildly embarrassed,
Danny bolts back into the house to get his board.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BLVD. - SLEEPING HOMELESS

Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks
in the street at an incredible rate. He turns the tight
corner and cuts off a turning car. The man yells.

Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the
left-hand side of the street and crosses. Approaching
quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a BUS
STOP BENCH. Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the
clickity clack behind him.

DANNY LUNGES FROM HIS BOARD AND TACKLES DEREE. The two
crash into the street as a car henks from the inside
lane, barely missing the duo. Danny punches his brozher
in the face.

                 DANNY
Fucking asshole!

Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car
heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the
sidewalk. Just in time.

              DEREK
What the luck are you thinking!?

          DANNY
What are you thinking!? Friends don't
fight friends, Der! They stick
together!

          DEREK
They're not friends, Dan!

              DANNY
What the hell are they then?!

Derek picks his brother up and sits him on a BUS STOP
BENCH.

              DEREK
Just sit there and relax for a second.

          DANNY
I don't wanna relax!  You looked like
an idiot back there!

Derek stares and sits next to him. Cars and homeless
randomly pass in the b.g. Danny looks at his brother,
transfixed in thought.

              DANNY
What's happened to you, Derek?

TIGHT ON DEREK. He looks into his brother's eyes.

DISSOLVE TO BLACKNESS:

INT./EXT. CHINO PRISON - ESTABLISHING SHOTS

FILING OUT OF THE CELL.

The morning drill. His roommate, an old Latino guy,
right behind. Derek's eyes cast among the inmates,
noting everyone and looking for a friendly face. He
notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods.

WALKING THROUGH THE CAFETERIA.

Derek with his tray. A sea of tables divided by race. He
spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table. He
looks at STEVIE THE LEADER, but gets a nod from the HUGE
ARYAN next to him. Derek moves to sit with them.

A WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD.

From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner. They
casually greet each other. Derek then looks over to the
HUGE ARYAN from the cafeteria and to STEVIE MCCORMICK,
the crazy looking leader. Derek walks over and shakes
their hands.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

Derek quietly folds towels with a young, chattering black
man.

          YOUNG MAN
You got lucky, man. I was in the
kitchen for a year before making it in
here. Pots and motherfucking pans...
disgusting beef stroganoff shit...
boiling hot water...fuck that!
     (looking over)
My name's Lamont, man.

Derek doesn't even look at LAMONT.  Stone cold, he
continues folding.

          LAMONT
I got your back. Righteous white
Cracker with attitude. Just like the
Judge who sentenced me, man.

Lamont laughs but then becomes serious.

         LAMONT
If your smart though you'll remember
one thing. You're the nigger in here.
Not me.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

DEREK'S POV. He sees Stevie McCormick conferring with a
Mexican gang leader.  The Mexican hands Stevie a joint
through a handshake.

Derek turns and talks to two white guys who seem
impressed. Stevie walks up and takes a hit off his
joint.

          STEVIE
I was just talking about you.  You're
Cammeron's boy?

Derek turns and stares at him.

          DEREK
His boy? No, I don't think so, man.
I'm not anybody's boy.

          STEVIE
Well...you know what I mean.

              DEREK
Nooo, I don't know what you mean.

Derek and Stevie lock eyes.  Stevie sneaks a hit and
offers Derek.

              STEVIE
Here, man. Relax and have a hit.

Derek stares at him.

          DEREK
Nooo...how about you getting that
fucking shit awax from me?

Stevie looks at him, ready to kill. The other two can't
believe Derek's gall. Stevie shrugs.

          STEVIE
You got a problem, man?

          DEREK
Excuse me? Do I have a problem? No,
I don't have a problem. Do you have a
problem?

                 STEVIE
No. I don't.

Stevie stares at Derek and walks off. He turns back
again and he and Derek lock eyes. He walks back to his
group.

              DEREK
Who the fuck are you?

Derek turns back to the other two and they are already
walking away. Derek looks at the two and back to Stevie.
Stevie sits with HUGE ARYAN and says something to him.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - EARLY MORNING
Lamont in mid-conversation.

              LAMONT
But I won't go down on that shit.  No
way, no how.   You ever been with a
soul sister?

Derek looks over and meets his eyes.
Lamont sees this and laughs.

Just for a second.

                   LAMONT
                 Oh shit! Sorry, man! Forgot who the
                 luck I was talking to there for a
                 second.
               (after a beat)
                 Let me ask you this one though cause I
                 don't know the white man's take. You
                 like eating pussy?

Derek can't help but smile.

          LAMONT
Oh man! You sick fucking bastard!
You sick pig!

                 DEREK
And you don't!?  Shut up.

         LAMONT
Man...you don't know shit about the
brothers. We won't go down on that
shit if the bitch was holding a gun to
our fucking head.

Derek laughs and the two continue to converse.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON QUAD - DAY

A group of White Aryans are gathered in the yard. Derek
plays basketball with a mixed assemblage, including
Lamont. Derek continues to look over every now and then
at Stevie and his group. Stevie suddenly smiles towards
Derek.

Not understanding what it's all about, Derek turns
'around. Standing there is HUGE ARYAN and his STOCKY
 FRIEND.. They proceed to beat the shit out of Derek right
 in the middle of the court. The players circle as Derek
 rolls on the ground. He gets bombarded with kicks and
 punches, a few even coming from randoms on the court.

CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

A beat-up Derek quietly folds. Lamont stays quiet.  He
glances over but knows Derek isn't in the mood.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON LUNCH

Derek looks over to the white table and they something
amongst themselves. They break into laughter. Derek
thinks about eating somewhere else, but there's nowhere
to go. He walks BACK over to the white table and looks
at STEVIE.

                 STEVIE
How's your face, man?

Everyone laughs. Derek sits and eats, his tail between
his legs.

                 STEVIE
That'll teach you.  Don't be a prick
to your superiors.

CUT TO:

EXT. NARROW PRISON CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON

Stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette. He turns
a corner and standing there waiting for him is DEREK.
Derek stares him down.

                 STEVIE
What do you want?

          DEREK
I'm right here, man. You wanna have
it out with me, let's go. Just me and
you though.

          STEVIE
Man...you are a stupid motherfucker.
You know that? When are you--?

Derek cracks him in the face and Stevie falls to the
ground.

          DEREK
Stupid?! You have anything else to
say, you little pussy! Hunh?!

         STEVIE
Fuck you!

Derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off. A
few black prisoners laugh at Stevie from the PING PONG
TABLE.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON SHOWER - MORNING

Derek puts his head down under the warm water and closes
his eyes. From out of nowhere, he is slammed out of
frame to the floor. HUGE ARYAN'and his STOCKY BUDDY from
earlier proceed to beat him. Bathers leave and after a
few moments, Stevie's boys drop their TOWELS.

              HUGE ARYAN
Well well well. A virgin.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHOWER - LATER

Derek lies on the tile floor, bloody and beaten.

              HUGE ARYAN
You ain't so tough now, are you?

The two men smile at each other, kick him and exit.
After a few seconds, LAMONT enters with the cart and
picks up dirty towels. He spots Derek laying on the
tile.

                 LAMONT
Motherfucker. What now, man?

He tends to Derek. He picks him up, throws him over his
shoulder, and carries him off.

                   LAMONT
         Shit, holmes.
               (carrying him)
         Hang on to me, man. You're heavy.

INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - EVENING

Derek lies on a table, silent.  A Mexican DOCTOR examines
his ass.

          DOCTOR
Well, you do have some tearing down
here. Christ. Okay. I'm gonna have
to stitch you up so I'll be back.    

The doctor passes Dr. Sweeney on his way out. Derek hears
Sweeney talk to the doctor and turns his head. The two
look at each other for a long moment. Sweeney sits down
next to him and puts his hand on Derek's shoulder. Derek
finally breaks down and sobs.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - LATE NIGHT

Sweeney and Derek in mid-conversation.  A small lamp
shines off their faces.

          SWEENEY
Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek.
Not skin color. Skin is thin. I
don't get you, man.  I don't.
         (after a beat)
I got my Doctorate in Education...not
in medicine. But if you think babies
come into this world evil...you're
fucked up, Derek. You're way to smart
to believe that shit.
     (then)
There's nothin' more beautiful Derek,
nothin' more pure, nothin' more
innocent...than a baby.

             DEREK
They killed my father, Sweeney.

          SWEENEY
Jesus Derek. Use that brain God gave
you for chrissake. What are you gonna
do? Seek revenge your whole life and
become a lifer in here. That's what
these guys are like, you wanna be like
them? Fucking little boys in prison?
Think, man. None of your guys back
home give a shit about you.
     (after a beat)
They only care about your brother.
The new blood. And he sure as hell
can't take care of himself like you
could.

Derek looks at the man with regret.

          DEREK
Get me outta here, Sweeney.

Sweeney looks at the young man, heavily weighing his
options. The two lock eyes.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON QUAD - DAY

Derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself.
A shadow approaches from behind.

              VOICE
How you doin', man?

Derek turns his head and sees LAMONT standing there.

          DEREK
All right.
         (after a beat)
How are you?

          LAMONT
I'm fucking incarcerated, man. With a
bunch of faggots. How you think I'm
doin'?

Derek looks at the young man and can't help but laugh.
Derek slowly gets up and limps past Lamont.

          LAMONT
What are you gonna do, man?

Derek looks at him for a few moments, still shaken.

              DEREK
I'm not going to do anything.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM

He looks through the window at his mother. Together they
pick up the phone.

TIGHT ON DEREK. He can feel her pain more than he can
feel his own. He forces a smile.

DEREK

Hey Mom.

DORIS

Hello.

The two sit there and stare at each other for a few
moments.

          DORIS
Dr. Sweeney called me. He spoke with
a guy on the parole board here.
     (then)
He thinks you might be getting out
soon.

Derek nods and stares at his mother, broken.

              DEREK
How are the others?

          DORIS
Davina's good. UCLA Math major.
     (frustrated)
All three of you have always been so
great in school. I wonder why all
this--

              DEREK
What about Dan, Mom?  How's he?

          DORIS
He's doing the same stuff you were
doing, Derek. Hanging out with
Cammeron, getting into trouble. It
brings back a lot of sad memories.
And I can't do anything...he won't
listen to me. He needs you.

Derek stares at his mother like it's the last thing he
wanted to hear.

          DEREK

You're my best friend, Danny. You're
my only friend. And I just want
what's best for you.

The two rub heads as DEREK puts his arm around him.
Danny squeezes back and Derek kisses him on the top of
the head.

How the hell...?

Derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the
hell out of the officers.

                 COP #2
Son of a bitch.

              DEREK
Pretty shitty assignment you got.

              COP #1
Out of respect for your father.

          DEREK
Oh yeah? What the hell do you know-

The two men sit there speechless as Derek walks over to

INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A SLEEPING DORIS

She snores on the couch. The clock on the wall reads

Derek heads for the girls in the living room. He genzly

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

Derek stares at himself in the mirror. A million
thoughts race through his head as computer keys echo in
the b.g. He looks at all of his tattoos and SCARS.

TIGHT ON HIS UPPER BODY. He stares at the SWASTIKA on
his tit. He puts his hand over the tattoo to see what
he looks like without it. He turns on the shower and
gets inside.

129 INT. SHOWER - TIGHT ON DEREE

As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand
and sits on.the bottom of the tub. He looks at it a long
time before he bends over to pick it up. He immerses his
face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself.

INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY

He sits back down at the computer and looks back at his
brother as he dries off. Danny thinks to himself and
types a sentence.

          DANNY (V/O)
There was only one person who loved
Derek more than me.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - MORNING - FLASHBACK

The place is immaculate. DENNIS VINYARD, the father of
the household, eats his breakfast in his LA COUNTY
FIREFIGHTER UNIFORM. Vintage fireman material:
muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair. Handsome.
A pretty and well-dressed Doris SINGS while she scrambles
eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers.

          DANNY (V/O)
That was Dad. They were best friendS.
Fathers and sons are never best
friends...but they were..

YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father with
a cap turned backwards. Doris breaks from song and yells
to the back.

          DORIS
Breakfast!

              DENNIS
Okay! Let's go, Davina! Derek!

              DORIS
So what's this all about, Dennis?

Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny.
YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos,
walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his
backpack and blue VENICE HIGH gym bag. He drops it all
onto the ground and sits at the table.

                 DENNIS
Good morning.

                 DEREK
Good morning.

Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go
to work. Young Danny eats quietly.

              DORIS
What about this gang stuff?

          DENNIS
Jesus Doris...it's not that big of a
deal. All departments have to take a
precaution class on gang patrol today.

          DEREK
What for?

          DENNIS
A guy was shot yesterday in
Inglewood...changin' a valve on a
hydrant. LAPD is worried that more
firefighters will become targets.
That's what this bullshit is about.
     (sipping his coffee)
A good father this guy was though and
now he's in intensive care because of
some goddamn--! They've pretty much
declared war on LAPD and us.

          DORIS
Why you guys though? I can see them
but the fire department?

          DENNIS
They think we would rather let a
building burn down over there than
fight it. So now we got two fights
goin' on at one goddamn time.

Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes.

          DENNIS
         (to the bedroom)
Dayins! Get in here!

              DAVINA (O.S.)
I'm coming right now! Jesus!

          DENNIS
I'll tell you one more thing. This
"affirmative blaction" shit is driving
me up the fucking wall. Firefighters
gettin' 99's on their tests while
rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk
away with the job.

         DANNY
Don't we have to have "affirmative
action?"

              DENNIS
Not when a job requires ability.  No.

          DORIS
A lot of people say otherwise, Danny.
Including me.

          DENNIS
A lot of people don't know shit,
either.

Doris just stares at the back of her husband's head like
she wants to smack it. He turns back and disarms her
with a look.

          DENNIS
If I'm fightin' a brush fire...
surrounded by thousand degree
flames...who would I want watchin' my
back? A guy who scores a 99 or a guy
who scores a sixty?
     (then)
You don't see half the NBA with
whites, gooks and spics.

          DORIS
Nooo...what you don't see are
minorities on the boards of Fortune
500 companies cause whites won't stand
for it.

          DENNIS
Doris! I'm tired of your damn
argument! You sound like an idiot!

          DEREK
Sweeney actually had a pretty good
take on affirmative action the other
day.

          DENNIS
     (smiling)
Really? I didn't know you spoke
"African", Derek? Where'd you learn
that shit? Johannesberg?

Dennis laughs and Derek eventually smiles. Danny looks
at them, not really understanding. Doris stares down
Dennis.

          DORIS
Honey? Please don't speak that way.
They don't--

          DENNIS
How am I speaking, Doris!? Hunh?!
I'm speakin' fineP
     (quickly to Derek)
Hey. Don't let that him confuse you
over there, Derek. Look at me. This
shit he's pulling is a load of crap.
Hey. Look at me, Derek. I mean it.
If we keep givin' niggers everything,
there'll be nothing left for us.

Derek and Danny stare at their father, not knowing how to
react.

          DORIS
You can be a stupid son of a bitch
sometimes.

              DENNIS
And then we have naive fools like her.

          DORIS
I really hate you with a passion some
times.

An upset Doris exits the room past YOUNG DAVINA.  Dennis
looks to Derek.

              DENNIS
You know what I mean though, right?

        DEREK
(nodding)

Yeah.

          DAVINA
         (to the family)
Good morning.

She sits.

Her lips glare excessively this morning.

          DENNIS
Well...good morning, Miss Monroe!
     (smiling)
Look at you. You look like a star.

          DEREK
I like that color, Davina.

DAVINA
Thanks
                 DENNIS
You did like it.

Dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin.

                   DAVINA
              (whining)
         Come on, Dad.

          DENNIS
Yeah. Well you're lucky I'm letting
you wear that crap on your eyes. I
love you but you're too young.

                 DAVINA
That sucks, man.

          DENNIS
It totally sucks. And we all
sympathize with you, too.

Everyone laughs but Dan, still shaken over his mother.

          DENNIS
         (Shifting to Danny)
You got practice today?

Danny shakes his head no.

                 DANNY
Coach's sick.

              DENNIS
You wanna go to Der's game with me?

DANNY

Sure.

          DENNIS
     (quickly to Derek}
Santa Monica High tonight, right?

DEREK

Yep.

          DENNIS
Perfect.
     (to Danny)
Ben'll whip us up a couple of double
deckers and we'll head over.

        DANNY
(smiling)

Okay.

Dennis smiles, reaches over with a fatherly hand, and
messes up his hair.

BACK QUICKLY TO:

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY - PRESENT

He stops typing and almost cries. He leans back in his
chair and and stares himself in the side mirror. He
feels his bald head, almost exploring.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEN'S BURGER SHOP - LATE NIGHT

A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside
begging for change. Seth and Cameron, both beat-up,
drunk and bloody, stare at the man.

          HOMELESS MAN
Spare change for a cheeseburger?

              SETH
Get a job and buy one why don't you.

                 HOMELESS MAN
God bless you.

          SETH
Fuck you.

Seth stumbles into the shop.  Cam stares at the homeless
man, psychotically.

                 HOMELESS MAN
Fifty cents is all I ask.
Vietnam, man.

I was in

          CAMMERON
Really? So you've had what? Thirty
years to get your shit together?

          HOMELESS MAN
All I want is something to eat.

          CAMMERON
There are plenty of fuckin'
dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam
boy. Go get yourself one.

In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands.

                 HOMELESS MAN
Did I do something?

          CAMMERON
You're a disgrace to the white race.
If Adolf Hitler was alive...God bless
his soul...he would have you shot.

          HOMELESS MAN
Fuck you then. Now and forever.  Fuck
you.

Cameron knees the weaker man square in the face. The
man slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an
afterthought, Cameron kicks him several more times.

                 CAMMERON
Noooo. Fuck you.

QUICKLY TO ACROSS THE STREET. Little Henry and two of
his friends watch Cammeron's brutality from their bikes.
They turn in the opposite direction and hurry off.

INT. BURGER SHOP - CAMHERON AND SETH

CUT TO:

Seth eats a burger and chili fries at the same time.
Cameron smokes across from him and watches Seth eat like
a pig. He takes a look at the homeless man outside who
still lays motionless. Cam feels his BANDAGED FACE.

              CAMMERON
I think I need to go to the hospital.

                 SETH
Seriously?

          CAMMERON
I don't know. I think so.

                 SETH
Where's Stacey?

                 CAMMERON
Who gives a fuck?

Seth takes a bite and chews.

               SETH
Derek's a fuckin' traitor pussy.

         CAMMERON
Well...we might be pussies too if we
got treated the way he did.

                 SETH
What do you mean?

          CAMMERON
Stevie McCormick called...old school
Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin'
life. He hated Derek.
     (exhaling)
Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in
there.

          SETH
         (overwhelmed)
Fucking A.

Seth continues to eat.  Cammeron looks out the window and
hates what he sees.

              CAMMERON
Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?

SETH

What?

CAMMERON'S POV. A large, mature and sharp-looking BLACK
MAN helps A BEAUTIFUL BLOND out of a RED BMW. THEY KISS.
Cammeron is at a loss for words. Cam puts out his
cigarette as the couple ENTERS.

          CAMMERON
     (looking at the two)
Is there anything sacred in this
country anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey.
Stop feeding your face for a second
and look behind you.

Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple.
He turns back to Cam and sings a verse from the famous
atevie Wonder song, EBONY AND IVORY. Cameron laughs.
The black man turns and looks at the two.

          CAMMERON
Can we help you with something? Do
you have any questions about the menu?

                 BLACK MAN
No questions.

          CAMMERON
I recommend either the "Big Ben
Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special."
Ben'll replace the dark meat with the
white meat if you ask nicely.

          BLACK MAN
     (fed up)
What's your problem, pal?

          CAMMERON
I ain't your fucking pal first of all.
Secondly...I don't have problems.
People who luck with me have problems.

              WHITE GIRL
Come on. Let's get out of here.

          CAMMERON
Hey! What a great idea! You got a
clever little whatever it is there.
I'd listen to it if I were you.

                 BLACK MAN
You're not me.

          CAMHERON
     (smiling)
And I thank God Almighty every day for
that, believe me.

                 SETH
Excuse me? Tyrone?

          BLACK MAN
My name's not Tyrone either.

SETH
Whatever.  Why can't you stick to your
own race?

          WHITE GIRL
     (disgusted)
Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes
come from?!

          CAMMERON
What the luck difference does it make
where we come from, bitch? I'm from a
place called America. A place that
used to be a nice place to live before
it became fuckin' Africa-America.

               BLACK MAN
You ignorant mother--

Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun
totally visible to the couple.

          SETH
You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole?
Do you? Make your move now if you do.
If you don't...get the luck out of my
sight. Cause I'm real close to
shoving my piece up your girlfriend's
stinky pussy.

The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth's
belly. He grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the
joint. Seth sits back down and the two laugh. Cameron
looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air.

          CAMMERON
     (smiling)
Everything's hunky dory, Ben!  No
problemo. Only us white folk.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - A DIGITAL CLOCK

It reads 2:36 a.m. Shiftless Derek lifts a sleeping
Danny off the computer keyboard. He helps him into the
bottom bunk, tucks him in, and watches him snooze.

             DEREK
     (softly)
Did you "save" it?

An asleep Danny nods. Derek slowly walks back into the
bathroom to grab his towel off the floor. He looks at
his SWASTIKA TAT in the mirror and sighs to himself. He
turns off the light and exits.

CUT TO:

INT. BURGER JOINT - SETH AND CAMMERON

Seth finishes his display of gluttony.

          CAMMERON
It wouldn't irritate me so much if the
ratio was a little more even.

                 SETH
What's that?

         CAMMERON
       (going mad)
Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost
all of those orange kid relationships
are black man and white women and I'm
fucking sick of seein' it! I wouldn't
mind so much if it were more even.

                 SETH
Huge dicks, Cam.  That's all it is.

          CAMMERON
I used to think that too but...it's
gotta be more, man. It has to be more
than the fact they they carry a big
load. Chicks aren't that shallow, are
they? It's politically correct...
that's what it is. White
women...bein' seen with the
coloreds...it's great for their image.
Bitches today want to be known as
bein' fuckin' color blind.

              SETH
They get off on it.

              CAMMERON
And you can't really blame Tyrone.

                 SETH
Why the fuck not?

          CAMMERON
Well...how'd you like to drag around
some fat fly girl? I wouldn't.

          SETH
No shit.
     (imitating)
Oh go girlfriend! Don't be puttin' up
wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl!

Seth and Cammeron laugh and head outside--leaving a mess
on the table.

EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - THE CHEROKEE FROM EARLIER

The white vehicle gets passed by cars left and right.

INT. CHEROKEE - HENRY'S POV

Henry sits up front with JEROME, nervous and scared.  The
three thugs in back lock and load.

                       LITTLE HENRY
          You gonna waste 'em?

                       JEROME
          Only if we have to.

Jerome grabs a baseball bat and they quietly get out.

INT. VAN - TIGHT ON LITTLE HENRY

Me bites his nails and watches the foursome sneak up on
an oblivious Seth and Cammeron.

EXT. GRAVEL PARKING LOT - HENRY'S POV

The men close in. Seth and Cam are blind to it.  Jerome
raises the bat as they close in and we--

FADE TO:

INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING - BIRDS CHIRPING

Danny stares at himself in the mirror and tries to find
some stubble on his chin.

INT. BEDROOM - A SLICK DEREK

He stares into the mirror in a coat and pants.  Danny
rushes to get his things together.

          DANNY
I'm printing it up and we're out of
here.

          DEREK
Hurry up.

Derek walks out into the living room.

INT. MESSY LIVING ROOM - DORIS

She's on the couch watching cartoons. She takes a jar of
Vick's Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest. Derek walks
in the room, bends over and kisses her on the forehead.
Davina sits on the couch and writes. Derek just smiles.

              DORIS
Wow. What happened?

              DEREK
I gotta see my parole officer.

              DAVINA
Hey Der? Do you have Excel on disk?

             DEREK
I've got everything on disk.

Davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom.  Doris
looks at Derek.

                 DORIS
You look good.

Derek smiles and caresses his mother's cheek.

          DEREK
We're getting out of here soon.  Is
that okay with you?

          DORIS
I'd love it.
     (after a beat)
Do you think I should color my hair?

DEREK

Yes.

He sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment.  He
thinks to himself.

          DORIS
I'm glad you made it back. I wasn't
too sure I was going to see you again.
You know how I get.

Filled with regret, he nods.

          DEREK
You think you'll be able to forgive
me? Someday maybe?

              DORIS
You're my son. Of course I will.

Derek smiles and can't believe his tearful reaction.

              DEREK
Look at me. I'm such a pussy.

                 DORIS
No you're not.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BLVD. - A NEWSPAPER MACHINE

Derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy
of the LA TIMES. Danny continues to skate ahead of him.
Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one
in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.

INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DEREK'S POV

He takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems
normal. A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers,
dressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other
direction.

Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a
short Korean.man behind the counter. Her young daughter
grabs her leg. Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper.

                 DEREK
What do you want?

              DANNY
Maple bar and a...large milk.

Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits. She
wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek.

          DEREK
         (to the girl)
You look pretty.

She laughs.

          TISHA
Thank you.

                 DEREK
How do I look?

       BLACK GIRL
(bashfully)
Fine.

DANNY'S POV. He looks up from the paper.  He watches the
girl together with his brother.

                 DEREK
What's your name?

BLACK GIRL

Tisha.

         DEREK
How old are you, Tisha?

She holds up four fingers. Derek smiles.

         BLACK MOTHER
         (staring at Derek)
Come here, Tisha.

Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek
watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they
make their way down the street.

Outside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and
the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and
wait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk
inside.

                 DEREK
What's goin' on?

              SWEENEY
We need to talk, Derek.

              DEREK
How'd you find out I was here?

              SWEENEY
We were just at your apartment.

          RASMUSSEN
Cammeron and Seth are in the ICU at
St. Johns, Derek. They were jumped in
front of Ben's Burgets early this
morning.

Derek thinks to himself for a few more seconds.

          DEREK
How bad?

          RASMUSSEN
They'll live.
     (then)
They must have been looking for
somebody else.

Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away.
Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him.

He eyes

TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DEREK. The two lock eyes.

         SWEENEY
Are they coming after you?

          DEREK
Fuckin' A.

Sweeney sighs.

          SWEENEY
I don't know.
     (after a long beat)
You might have to talk to your old
crew though.

Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his
brother.

              DEREK
I can't, Sweeney.

                 SWEENEY
Try, Derek. Okay?

Derek senses the danger in his voice.

       SWEENEY
Okay?  Before it explodes.

Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.

                 SWEENEY
And watch your back.

Derek nods.

          SWEENEY
(back to Danny)
You showing up today?

Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes.

SWEENEY

Good.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE HIGH - DEREK AND DANNY

They are outside the fence surrounding the field.
Students head off to morning class.

        DEREK
Hey. Keep your head up, alright?  I'm 
going to take care of this.

DANNY
How?

          DEREK
I don't know. I'll figure it out
though. You gonna be okay?

DANNY
Yeah.

The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS.

              DANNY
I gotta turn that paper in.

Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back
at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g.

DEREK
Hey.

DANNY
What?

          DEREK
Come here.

Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and
clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one
thing but something else comes out.

              DEREK
I'll see you at home.

Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear
phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother
through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy
and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns
and walks down the street.

          COP #1
You need a lift anywhere?

DEREK
Nope.

Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence,
and stares at the school.

INT. MESSY HALLWAY - DANNY AND LIZZY

Students rush past them. Danny kisses Lizzy and she
hurries off to class. He pushes on the men's room door.

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - SAME

Danny enters, sets his "AMERICAN HISTORY X" PAPER on top
of the sink, and takes an unearthly long piss at the
urinal. He finishes, flushes and turns.

Standing there is LITTLE HENRY. A GUN IN HIS HAND.

                 DANNY
Jesus Christ.  What are you doing,
Henry?

          LITTLE HENRY
     (afraid)
What does it look like I'm doin'?

                 DANNY
Come on, man, no.  You don't want to
do this. Come on.  Henry?

THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol.
It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest.
He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The
force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two
kids who just entered bolt for help.

Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The
two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED
PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass
is raking his lungs.

              LITTLE HENRY
         (terrified)
Danny?

Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper.  He blinks,
coughs, twitches. And dies.

                       LITTLE HENRY
         Vinyard? Danny?

Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek
had after killing Lawrence. Together they FREEZE on the
cold tile floor.

CUT TO:

INT. HALL AT VENICE HIGH BATHROOM - YELLOW POLICE TAPE

Officers and detectives monitor the area. Young
students, including Lizzy and her friends, stand around
and cry. Rasmussen brings THE BLOODY PAPER over to
Sweeney. Sweeney looks at it for a moment but is
interrupted.

          RASMUSSEN
He won't let go. Will you talk to
him?

INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY

Derek cradles his bloody brother. Sweeney walks over,
crouches, and talks to Derek's back.

         SWEENEY
Derek? You gotta let him go, man.
They gotta get him outta here.

DEREK

I can't.

Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself.
He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the
hall.

INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINA

Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face -- torn
between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from
them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow.

          SWEENEY
Derek! I know what you're thinkin'
right now and I want you to forget
about it!

          DEREK
How the luck do you know what I'm
thinkin', Sweeney!?

          SWEENEY
Cause I'm thinkin' the same damn
thing!

Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed
Sweeney.

              DEREK
They shot him in a fucking...pisshole!

          SWEENEY
And goin' after them won't bring him
back. Don't do it, Derek. Please,
man. You've come too far. The war is
over.

Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue
against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly
approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young
man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's
shoulder.

              DEREK
It stops now, Sweeney.

Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way
back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.

              DANNY (V/O)
We've heard it a million times, a
Bible quote become cliche: "Vengeance
is mine, sayeth the Lord."

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DANNY AND HENRY

A still of the two immediately after the murder. We move
in tighter and tighter until we get close on Danny.

          DANNY (V/O)
Vengeance brought about by hate...and
fear. When it points its head in our
direction, we take notice and
everything changes. The way we choose
our friends, the way we protect our
families, the way we create enemies
out of strangers.
     (then)
Welcome to America.

TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES. They are gently pushed shut by
Henry's two small BLACK FINGERS.

    TITLE CARD: SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED

    OVER BLACK: APRIL 26, 1978, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK

1   FADE IN:                                                        


2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY                               

    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and
    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.

3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM

    Irving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               What are you doing, going behind my
               back? Telling people I'm screwing
               up this operation? I got you a
               suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               The shittiest suite at the Plaza
               Hotel.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What?!

                         IRV ROSENFELD
               The shittiest fuckin' suite.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Based on what--?
                                       2.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               And the food is wrong, and--What is
               this? You, like, went in my closet
               or something?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               No

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Are you dressing him like you're
               dressing me now?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
                   (shakes her head)
               No, what are you thinking? This
               isn't all about you, you know that.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               What, did you try to dress me so I
               would look like him?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               No, you're not dressed like him,
               all right?

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               But I do, I look like him.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               You asked me to show you how this
               was done, you wanna fuck it up be
               my guest.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               What is your problem?


                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Hey, look, I never laid a hand on
               her, all right? Is that what this
               is about?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
                        (British accent)
               Well technically, that's not true.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Look, we never had sex ok? I just --
                                                            3.


                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               What'd I do? I put my hand like
               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very
    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his
    face.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't you fucking touch me. That
          bothers me --

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Oh it does?

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Oh yeah.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That bothers you?

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yes.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You know, a lot of shit bothers me
          too, but I was trying to help you.
          If I wanted to bother you, if I
          really wanted to fucking bother
          you, this is what I'd do.


    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent
    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,
    staring at Richie.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You shouldn't have done that.

    Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and
    messed up looking very angry.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          How's that? You bothered now? (no
          answer) Alright, don't make a thing
          of it.

                     EDITH GREENSLY
          You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't
          like that.
                                                                4.


                        RICHIE DIMASO
              Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make
              a thing of it.

                        EDITH GREENSLY
              It takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in
    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully
    starts helping him put it back together.

                        RICHIE DIMASO
              Big fucking deal. We got to get in
              the other room, come on. The
              mayor's in there.

                        EDITH GREENSLY
              Yes I know that.

                        RICHIE DIMASO
              Should we go to the beauty parlor?
              Is that what we should do?

    Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on
    the dresser. Inside are stacks of cash.

    Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD
              How's it look.

                        EDITH GREENSLY
              You look fine.

    Richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and
    intense.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
              Let's go.

                                                      CUT TO:

    DRAMATIC PUSH IN ON: THE DESTINY OF THE STORY MAYOR CARMINE
    POLITO PINKY RING, ROTARY CLUB PIN STANDS FINISHING STORY TO
    BUSINESSMAN CARL ELWAY AS IRVING, EDITH, RICHIE WAIT FOR HIM
    TO FINISH -- THEY ALL SHAKE HANDS AND SIT ON THE COUCH ACROSS
    FROM EACH OTHER. RICHIE CAREFULLY SETS THE BRIEFCASE DOWN ON
    THE GROUND NEXT TO HIS FEET. CUT TO THE SCENE AS VIEWED
    THROUGH A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR. THE DATE AND TIME STAMP
    VISIBLE.

                        CARMINE POLITO
              I thought he was going to be here.
              I do business face to face, person
              to person. That's just who I am.


    Richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over
    to Carmine unprompted. LEAVE MONITOR'S POV AND RETURN BACK TO
    THE SCENE.

    IRV'S EYES WIDEN AS IN `NO! DON'T DO THAT!' WHILE HE AND
    RICHIE STARE AT EACH OTHER, EDITH TENSE, CARMINE LOOKS
    DISTURBED AT THE CASE COMING HIS WAY. HE STANDS ABRUPTLY.

                        CARL ELWAY
              Whoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll
              handle that for the Mayor.

                        RICHIE DIMASO
              No, it's for the Mayor. It would be
              a sign of disrespect to the sheik
              if the mayor didn't take it
              himself. It's for you Mayor.

    Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.

                        CARMINE POLITO
              What are you doing? What-- (to
              Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is
              this?

                        CARL ELWAY
              No, I'll handle it. I'm gonna take
              care of-- Everything's good. I
              got everything under control. (TO
              RICHIE) That's for me. I handle all
              that for mayor.

                        CARMINE POLITO
              What is this?

    Irving looks over and says nothing. Not surprised at all how
    badly this is all going.
                                                         6.


Edith whispers to Richie.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          (whispers to Richie)
          Just stop it, ok

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          (whispers to Edith)
          He's gotta take it himself, okay?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          I don't know what the fuck that is
          but it's weird you understand?

                    CARL ELWAY
          Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          I came here to meet a sheik, that's
          all I know. I'm very interested in
          that but he's not here apparently.
          Carl?!

Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
          I'm very interested in meeting the
          Sheik. You let me know when THAT
          could happen! Thank you, have a
          good day.

Carmine leaves the room.

Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at
all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has
ruined it.

                    CARL ELWAY
              (leaving)
          Irving! You better come get him.


                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (stares at Irv)
          Go out there and get him right now.

                    CARL ELWAY
          Help me get him back!

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Go get him. He needs to take the
          fuckin' briefcase, Irving.
                                                            7.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I didn't wanna do it in the first
          place. This is your show, YOU go
          get him.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          No, you have no choice. You have
          to go get him. Now, go get him, so
          he takes the briefcase by himself!
          That's the whole plan, Irving!

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What were you doing pushing the
          fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          The whole fuckin' thing was falling
          apart. You know how much I paid
          for this goddamn hotel that you
          fucking asked for?!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Now I gotta go mop up your mess.
          I'm gonna go fucking mop up your
          mess!

Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to
get Carmine.


INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE FOYER - DAY

Irving paces back and forth as he waits for the elevator.

We push in on the concerned face of Sydney as Richie rambles
on to her.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You understand what I'm saying,
          right? It wasn't working.


INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Irving continues to pace back and forth in the hall waiting
for the elevator.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               Did you ever have to find a way to
               survive and you knew your choices
               were bad?

     Irving walks over and hits the elevator button again.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I learned how to survive when I was
               a kid.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               I would rather be on the taking
               side than the getting taken side
               any day of the week, especially
               after I saw how my father got
               taken. I mean, seeing that scarred
               me for life.


     EXT. UNDISCLOSED STREET - DAY 1940'S

     Young Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock
     through each window on the store, smashing them all.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I took it upon myself to drum up
               business. I became a different kind
               of guy than my father. I became a
               con artist -- from the feet up, for
               real.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I was gonna survive no matter what.
               I still had the glass business and

     Irving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on
     the phone. What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all
     around him.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               And I did some art dealing on the
               side. Stolen or forged art.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               So, one January I go to my friends
               pool party in Long Island.

     Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when
     he turns and sees Sydney for the first time.

     PUSH IN ON: Irving. He looks up, they lock eyes across the
     party.

     SYD REACHES FOR A SLICE OF FRUIT ON HIGH SET PLATE WHEN
     IRVING'S HAND GRABS HER ARM -- she turns, taken aback -

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Is that Duke Ellington on your
               bracelet?

     She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               As a matter of fact, it is. He died
               this year, you know.
                                                        10.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I know. I doubt anyone else here
          knows or cares about it.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Well I care. He saved my life many
          times.

Irving takes a good look at her, impressed.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (impressed)
          Mine too. Which one?


                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Jeep's Blues.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (smiles, warm)
          Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah.

Awkward pause.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          You wanna hear it?

                       SYDNEY PROSSER
          Right now?

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yeah.

          Sure.

CUT TO: PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER PLAYS START OF JEEP'S BLUES as
Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high
wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa.

          Who starts a song like that?!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          It's magic.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          Magic.

They listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out.
                                                            11.


                        SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
              He wasn't necessarily in good
              shape, and he had this comb-over
              that was rather -- elaborate. He
              had this air about him. And he had
              this confidence that drew me to
              him. He was who he was and he
              didn't care.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
              Like me, she was a very particular
              person. Like me, she came from a
              place where her options were
              limited -- and she had been someone
              she didn't want to be in her past.

              It actually can feel kind of sexy
              sometimes. There's a boldness in
              it. But where would that boldness
              take me? I didn't know. But I was
              gonna find out.

              Like me, she learned to survive and
              reinvent herself. She knew she had
              to reinvent her life and her
              identity. And like me, she
              envisioned a better elegant future
              for herself. Like me, she knew you
              had to have a vision.

               Well you're obviously here for a
               reason. Let's get to it.

                            SYDNEY PROSSER
               Alright.

               Do you have any clerical skills?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               She was unlike anybody I ever knew.
               She was smart. She saw through
               people in situations. And she knew
               how to live with passion and style.
               She understood Duke Ellington.

               -- and my dream,   more than

               other than who I   was.


24   EXT. LONG ISLAND DRY CLEANERS-- DAY                          24

     Irv holds the door open for Edith as she enters.

               -- I got two in the Bronx and three
               in Manhattan. (to an employee) Hey,
               Byron.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
               He had a chain of dry cleaning
               stores. He asked me to come in and
               upgrade my wardrobe-- he said a lot
               of nice things got left behind by
               people and forgotten over the years-
               -

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I mean you wouldn't believe the
               shit that people leave behind here.
               Unbelievable.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               People leave stuff here?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Oh yeah. They go out for the night,
               they drink, come here in the
               morning, put their clothes in and
               then they forget. They got no idea
               where they left it.

     Irving touches a hanging blue sequined dress.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
               Look at that. Sequined thing. I
               don't know. Is that nice or not?
                                                        14.


                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          It's beautiful.

Irving and Sydney continue to walk through towards the back
and enter a fur vault filled with elegant designer clothes.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I mean, some of it's been here for
          years. They're not picking it up.
          Nobody's picking it up.

Sydney starts riffling through nice things hanging on the
racks.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          You like that?

                       SYDNEY PROSSER
          I love it.

          I felt like we had a secret. Just
          the two of us. You know like that
          thing where you want to just be
          with the one person the whole time.
                                                             15.


                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               You feel like the two of you
               understand something that nobody
               else gets. I could just tell her
               everything about myself. And I
               never had anybody like that in my
               life before. I felt like finally, I
               can truly be myself without being
               ashamed, without being embarrassed.

39   INT. Irv's dingy office - DAY                                 39

     Irv leads Sydney into a small, dingy Manhattan office on an
     upper floor.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               What is this place? Do you sell art
               here?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Yeah, sometimes. This is my office.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               I know it's your office, but, you
               have these other places. What's
               this for? Why did you bring me
               here?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               This getting to be my main
               business, my growing business. I
               help get loans for guys that can't
               get loans. I'm their last resort.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               You're their last resort? Because
               interest rates are north of 12% and
               heading to 18%.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               That's right, smarty pants.

               really. And the war and the
               deficit and all of that shit.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I love you, you're so smart. You
               are.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
               Thanks kid but how do you get them
               the money?
                                                        16.

          Well --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          You don't do you? You don't.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          These guys are lousy risks, you
          know? I can't get them a loan but I
          get my fee. Five thousand.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Five thousand? You take five
          thousand and you don't give them
          anything?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          These are bad guys, you know? They
          got bad divorces, gambling habits,
          embezzling, all that shit, you know
          what I mean?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Everybody at the bottom crosses
          paths eventually in a pool of
          desperation and you're waiting for
          them.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          How about `we'?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          We?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          How bout it?

Sydney turns and begins walking out the door as Irving chases
her out.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Sydney. Sydney I'm sorry that was
          too much. I went too far. I didn't
          want to upset you.

She continues walking out without looking back and leaves.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Sydney please, I'm sorry! I know it
          ain't for everybody.

The door slams in Irving's face
                                                        17.

          Ah GOD I love getting to know you!

          What I do that for? I fucked it up.
          I should never tell a woman the
          truth. She's so smart. She's
          different.

OFF SCREEN THE DOOR OPENS. SHE WALKS RIGHT UP TO IRVING AS HE
SITS AT HIS DESK. SHE TOSSES HER COAT TO THE SIDE.

IRVING STARES UP HER TENSE -- WHAT WILL SHE DO?

          I have royal banking connections in

               And so Irving and I began our

               connections

                         BUSINESSMAN
               I'm Jim. I'm her employer. Listen -
               - she told me you can get me a line
               of credit. I know you have banking
               connections in London, England.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
               And after that...say "no" a lot
               until the guy is hooked.

     Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman
     chases after them.
                                                                19.

               NO!

               It was almost scary how easy it
               could be to take money from
               desperate people.

               meant to play.


42   INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY                            42

     Another desperate businessman sits across from Edith and
     Irving.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               We're very selective.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               You got a strong application. We'll
               talk about it.


     INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MARK.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I don't take a deal that I can't
               close.
                                                        20.


                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          You're not being aggressive enough
          in putting up your assets --

The man looks nervous --

                    NERVOUS LOAN APPLICANT
          Have you ever been to Queens? Have
          you ever been to Great Neck?
          Everybody knows my dealerships.


CONTINUOUS MONTAGE AS THEIR CLOTHING CHANGES FROM DAY TO DAY
BUT THE SETTING REMAINS THE SAME AS THEY CON MARK AFTER MARK.

A desperate man takes out a BUSINESS CHECK BOOK and writes
his check.

                    DESPERATE MAN
          Five thousand gets me fifty right?

                    ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN
          Five will get me thirty five. Is
          that right?

                    ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN, 35
          Five grand gets me fifty?


INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

Sydney and Irving laugh and celebrate.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          I was doing so much more business
          with her. I mean it doubled, then
          it tripled.


INT. IRV'S GLASS STORE - DAY

Sydney -- hair getting bigger -- goes over the books with a
Latino Man who nods and watches her --

Edith counts cash in the register - recounts it -- explains
how things can be done better as DRY CLEANING WORKER nods.

Irv watches happy.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          And I never met anyone, man or
          woman, in business who was so
          careful and precise about
          everything. Every stylistic detail.
                                                              21.


     INT. BUSINESSMAN OFFICE - DAY

     Irving and Edith discuss a piece of art they're in the
     process of selling to a businessman.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               We kept selling art together, too.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               It's really a fabulous example of a
               genre painting, which is really
               rare for the time. It's a boy and
               his dog. Non-religious painting.
               55. Golden age. Dutch painting.


     ANOTHER DAY -- A CAR DEALERSHIP OFFICE -- IRV DROPS THE
     CANVAS BAG REVEALING A VINTAGE PAINTING -- (COLORED ORBS AND
     LINES) -- TO THE MIDDLE AGED CAR DEALER WHO OWNS THE
     WAREHOUSE WHO WRITES A CHECK.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Paul Klee. Bauhaus Movement. 1920s.

                         MIDDLE AGED CAR DEALER
               Before we go any further, is this
               legit?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Let's just say it's missing from
               Spain and leave it at that.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               Don't show any Spanish friends.

     Irving and Sydney kiss passionately in front of the middle
     aged car dealer as he tries to hand them his check.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               I mean it just took off. We got an
               elegant Manhattan office. We called
               it London Associates for her
               accent.


44   INT. NEW OFFICE LOBBY - MADISON AVENUE - DAY                   44

     A JANITOR FINISHES POLISHING SILVER PLATED LARGE LETTERS:
     LONDON ASSOCIATES to a pale wall as he and Edith sip
     champagne from flutes and offer one to the worker who toasts
     with them.
                                                               22.


     IRV DOES HIS TRADEMARK MINIMALIST BADGER DANCE, IN PROFILE,
     TO QUIET DELIGHT OF SYDNEY.

     Irv and Edith kiss gently, lovingly, sincerely on the lips --

     They walk into their CLASSIC LOOKING, STAID, PRIVATE BANKING
     OFFICE SUITE.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               When I was around her I felt joy.
               Fucking joy! And love. That's what
               I felt.

                                                      SMASH TO:


46   EXT. PARK AVENUE - SUNNY DAY                                    46

47   They dance down Park Avenue together.                           47

     INT. LOBBY OF PIERRE HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

     Irv and Edith dance through the lobby.


49   THE PIERRE HOTEL CAFE                                           49

     As they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small
     dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet
     plays "I've Got Your Number". Camera circles them, putting
     their foreheads together, very happy. THEY SING TO EACH
     OTHER quietly as they dance close.


50   INT. ROOM AT PIERRE HOTEL -- NIGHT                              50

     Irv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces --

     He gets up, she watches him dress and leave --


52   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                     52

53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge.                           53

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               As, as far as I could see, people
               were always conning each other to
               get what they wanted. We even con
               ourselves.
                                                             23.


54   INT./EXT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                54

55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55

56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv       56
     gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his
     house --

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               We talk ourselves into things. We
               sell ourselves things we maybe
               don't even need or want by dressing
               them up. We leave out the risk. We
               leave out the ugly truth.


57   INT. IRV'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        57

     Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with
     bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer
     everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture
     his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball --
     that is taped to the refrigerator.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               Pay attention to that because we're
               all conning ourselves in one way or
               another just to get through life.

     Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes --
     with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR
     WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it --

     Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
               He was married, and he had a son.


58   INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       58

     DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread
     all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks
     over his shoulder.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
               He had adopted her son.

                         DANNY
               DADDY!
                                                             24.


                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
               He was a really good dad and I
               respected him for that. It was a
               tough situation for everyone.

     Irv's face lights up.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD
               Danny. This is a fantastic
               picture. What did you do today?

                         DANNY
               That kid Donovan is being mean to
               me.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               The big kid? I thought Mommy picked
               you up so he couldn't bother you.

                         DANNY
               She was late, and then after we put
               out the fire, mommy said stay in my
               room with my baseball cards.

     Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his
     face and puts them on.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
               What fire?

                         DANNY
               Did you know they make a lamp that
               has the sun in it? [Irv looks at
               him] Mommy got the lamp. She made
               her special drink and the lamp made
               a fire.

     Irv looks concerned.


59   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    59

     Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her
     face is burned.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD
               I put out the fire. The fire is
               out.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               For the first time in my life I do
               the right thing.
                                      25.


          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
Oh shut up --

          IRVING ROSENFELD
I save a young single mother, and
her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -
-

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
You fell in love! Don't forget we
fell madly in love!

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Yes, I fell in love. My God, I
fell in love. Yes. But you know
what? I thought you were
mysterious like my mother until it
turned out that mysterious just
meant depressed, hard to reach. I
mean, I'm dying here! And you need
somebody who's gonna be quiet like
you. You're young, you're
beautiful. You gotta find somebody
else. You gotta go out and get
some friends all right? Don't sit
inside --

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
I don't like going out. You know
that I get anxiety when I have to
meet people. You know how hard that
is.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Yeah but you can't just stay in the
house with the fucking sun lamp.
Alright? And I can't-- I mean,
look, I can't trust you with it
anyway. That fire and everything. I
can't trust to leave you with
Danny.

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
I put the fire out Irving! There is
no fire! Maybe if you were here
more, then there wouldn't have been
a fire in the first place.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Oh, what, there wouldn't have been
a fire if I was here?
                                                          26.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Just stop with the whole fire
          thing. God it was a mistake. I'm
          sure a million people do that all
          the time. Those sun lamps are
          dangerous. Shouldn't even have them
          in the house, really. I bet that
          happens all the time. This was
          nothing.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          We're not happy. Alright?

Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying
nothing.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You know that I could take Danny.
          You know that most of your work is
          illegal. And you know that if you
          tried to divorce me, you know that--
          I'm not saying that I would, but
          I'm saying that I could. And I'm
          saying that that is why I don't
          like divorce, Irving. Women do that
          in divorces. Women get the
          children, and then the fathers
          never see them. My mother never got
          divorced. My grandmother never got
          divorced. There are NO divorces in
          my family. I am not getting a
          divorce.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Come on. What are we doing here?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          We fight and we fuck and that's
          what we do. That's our thing.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          She was the Piccaso of passive
          aggressive karate. She was better
          than any con artist I'd ever met
          including myself. And she had me
          like nobody had me.


Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Irving, come to mama. Come on.
                                                                27.


                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               You might say she was my karma for
               how I took advantage of people.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD
               Irving, come here. Come on. Get
               into bed.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
               Alright.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD
63             Baby, there's such good stuff here.                    63


     INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     DANNY SITS PLAYING ON THE BED WITH HIS TOYS.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               I did not want to leave the kid
               behind. He was my son. She had me.
               I was her mark.


     INT. LONDON ASSOCIATES - DAY

     SLOW PUSH IN FROM WIDE SHOT BEHIND NEW CLIENT/MARK, FROM THE
     BACK, AS THEY SIT FACING EDITH, TO ONE SIDE, AND IRV, BEHIND
     THE DESK.

     CAMERA KEEPS PUSHING IN SLOWLY TOWARD THE BACK OF THE MARK'S
     HEAD AS HE FACES SYD AND IRV.

     WE NOW SEE THE MARK: A charismatic, mercurial, wild eyed
     BUSINESSMAN "MORT PAPIERMAN" in need of a loan.

     Mort's eyes go from her knees to her eyes -- His eyes meet
     Sydney's -- he looks soulful, open. She stares at him. Irv
     notices uncomfortably. He's JEALOUS.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               -- and every deal I take, I close.
               However, my fee is non refundable,
               just like my time.

                         MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
                   (filling out paper work)
               I want to thank you very much
               Irving for seeing me. Sorry I'm so
               nervous.

     Richie reaches for his top button to adjust it.
                                                       28.


                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          Am I not buttoned?

Edith stares at him and smiles.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          I just gotta say Mr. Rosenfeld,
          that Lady Edith was very adamant
          that you were top notch and --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's correct.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          I really need your help. I'm
          desperate. I've got the Audis for
          collateral and the two boats, and I
          forgot to mention that I have a
          little piece of real estate in Long
          Island.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          No, you didn't mention that. Two
          lunches and you never mentioned
          that.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          Oh, I was gonna mention it and then
          the guy with the hat walked in.

                     EDITH GREENSLY
          The hat.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          And I forgot totally. It was the
          second time we had lunch.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You couldn't see his eyes. He had
          no eyes. It was like, did he make
          it?

                     MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
              (laughing)
          Do they sell hats like that? Where
          do they come from? Actually, I went
          to the store that I thought maybe
          he bought it there. I was gonna get
          you one --

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You were going to get me one?
                                                   29.


                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          Like as a memento.

Irving decides to interject.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Two lunches?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Yes. It's two lunches. What's the
          big deal?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's unusual.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          I was trying to get him to be more
          aggressive. On his loan that is.

                    Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          You showed me a whole new side of
          the city I'd never seen before.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Oh, good. You're welcome.

                    Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          No, thank you.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I
          take you there?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Yes.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Should I take you there twice?


                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Stop.

IRVING MOTIONS SYDNEY TO COME CLOSE HE WHISPERS
CONFIDENTIALLY TO HER.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (confidential to Edith)
          What's going on, you like this guy?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Yes I like this guy.
                                                           30.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Is that messing up your judgement?
          Don't be stupid.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          No, he's not messing with my
          judgment.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Hey, play your part.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Fine. You play your part.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
              (holds out cashiers check)
          Take it to your people in London.
          Please, take it to them. I got the
          cashier's check right here. I give
          you five and you give me fifty
          right back, right? Please. Please
          don't reject me. Give a guy a
          chance.

MORT/RICHIE REPEATEDLY TRIES TO HAND IT TO IRV, WHO IS BUSY
STARING AT SYDNEY STARING AT MORT. MORT HOLDS THE CHECK IN
THE AIR UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARDLY UNTIL -- almost in slow
motion --Edith takes the check -- staring at Mort. IRV STARTS
TO LEAVE -

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          Zurich? You got an office in
          Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          If you could excuse me for one
          second?

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          Yeah, take your time. Do whatever
          you need to do. Go ahead, take your
          time.

HE HEADS TO THE REAR EXIT WHILE SYD MOVES TO ANOTHER -- IRV
OPENS THE DOOR - BAM -- A WARRANT IS HELD UP TO HIS FACE BY
STOCKY FBI AGENT SCHMIDT IN A SUIT - HE WALKS IRV BACK INTO
THE OFFICE --

AS Edith OPENS A SIDE DOOR -- BANG - FEDERAL AGENT STOCK
WALKS HER BACK INTO THE OFFICE WITH A WARRANT.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You got the wrong office, you're
          gonna be embarrassed.
                                                                31.


     THE AGENTS START PUTTING EDITH IN CUFFS IMMEDIATELY.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
               HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER.

                         MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
               I may not have you, Irving, but I
               have her on fraud. Impersonating
               another individual.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Fraud?! Fraud? What is that?
               Identity fraud?

     AGENTS SCHMIDT AND STOCK IMMEDIATELY START TAKING BOXES OF
     FILES FROM DRAWERS, IMPOUNDING EVIDENCE.

                         MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
               You may be from England, Edith, but
               you're not royal and you have no
               banking connections and that's a
               felony. How long is that? That's 3-
               5 years I think.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
                   (about the handcuffs)
               Hey! Not so tight!

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Oh really? That's interesting. I
               don't even know your real name.

     Richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet
               you.

     Richie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               You gotta get away from this guy.

     Agents take boxes of files out of the office- Irv standing
     alone in center of room- shell-shocked.


64   INT. FBI HOLDING OFFICES - DAY.                                  64

     SYDNEY IS LED INTO A HOLDING CELL BY AN FBI AGENT.
                                                             32.


                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               He wouldn't let me see her for
               three days. He even managed to
               delay a lawyer.


     INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights
     on. Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her
     eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair
     flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
65             She couldn't handle it.                               65


66   INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - NIGHT                                   66

     FLUORESCENT LIGHTS COME ON IN THE CELL -- Edith squints. Cell
     is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer
     of tea. He stands near her with the tea.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
                   (to the other side of the
                    two-way mirror)
               Joe, how come the fluorescents are
               on? Can we kill that, please? (to
               Syd) Jesus I put this lamp here for
               you 'cause I thought it'd be better
               for you. There's a wire here.
               They're scared because people hang
               themselves but I know you're too
               smart for that. Where's the table
               and chair? There's no bed here?
               It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is
               everybody off today? Jesus Christ
               it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare
               you. I don't know. Maybe it was my
               idea. Maybe i'm a little off the
               beaten path you know? I don't know.
               You look dehydrated. Here, want to
               try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips
               are all chapped. (re: tea) It's
               herbal. My favorite.

     Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the
     corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup
     but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the
     cup to her lips.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               I know you think -- look at me.
               Hey. Edith.
                         (MORE)
                                                        33.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          I know you think Irv loves you. I
          know you think you know him -- that
          he sees the world as a cold, dark
          place, and he cares about nobody
          but very few people on his short
          list: his son, his father, Rosalyn,
          and you. And you think you're at
          the top of that list. But what if
          you're not. What if you're not even
          on the list at all? He'd be in
          here right now if he took the
          check.

She thinks about this. She trembles.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          He'd be in here right now if he
          took the check. But no, you did.
          God, it's, it's so clear to me.
          It's so crazy -- it's clear to me,
          but it's not clear to you. He uses
          you, Edith, to protect himself. To
          protect his son and his wife in
          Long Island. No? Yes. He put a
          ring on her finger, he adopted her
          son. They have huge house, they
          have two cars. What does she do all
          day? I'll tell you what she does --
          she plays with her nails, she
          watches T.V., and she spends your
          money, the money that you make.

Edith stares at Richie, taking this in.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          I don't like that you're in jail
          while he's going free. I don't
          like any of that. I want to help
          you. All the razzle-dazzle that he
          does, it's not good. It's not real.
          It's fake. It's not real. Who you
          are is who you are, between you and
          God. You and your soul. That's what
          matters. That's what counts.
          That's what I'm about. And that's
          what I see in you. Tell me you
          didn't feel it the first time we
          saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't
          think so. I'm not supposed to be
          talking like this, but I don't
          care, I break the rules.

Edith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what
he's saying.
                                                             34.


                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help
               you. I like you. (whispers) I like
               you. (dead serious) I like you.


67   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            67

     Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at
     Sydney.

     Richard Dimaso walks in.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Been in there three days. Hasn't
               been so good for her.

     Irv continues to stare at Sydney.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               How does that make you feel her in
               there? That check was for you,
               right? But you knew somethin' was
               off. That's 'cause you're good.
               You're, like, the best at what you
               do in the whole country, aren't
               you?

     Irv looks at him.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               But you know what? If the country
               were run by people like you, Irving
               Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern
               Europe or Guatemala. You ever been
               in Guatemala? You ever been in jail
               in Guatemala? You ever try to get a
               telephone or a permit or anything
               in Guatemala? That's what this
               country would be like if we let
               people, let the liars like you, run
               this country.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Who made you god and judge?

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               My grandmother lived to be ninety-
               three years old. Never lied in her
               life.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Congratulations.
                                                             35.


                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Thank you. I'm proud of that, too.
               Does that make her not a good
               person? Is that not something to
               strive for?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
               Why you breaking my balls? Get to
               the point.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               I see something in you, Irving. I
               get very excited. I think that we
               have a lot of potential here. Now,
               look. I came up with the idea.
               It's all from me. I want to change
               things. I want to go after white
               collar crime. Irving, you're very
               skilled. And I want you to teach me
               and we can do this. I want four
               people that do what you do.
               Fraudulent investments. Fake
               certificates of deposit. Stolen
               art, fake art. You get me four
               people and you're off the hook.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Four busts and you'll leave us
               alone? We don't have to testify?

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               You're good, you're done. Anything
               you want. But if you run, then your
               life is over. You'll be hunted, and
               it's gonna be very difficult for
               Rosalyn and your kid to live in
               this country.


68   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT                         68

     A NICE UPPER EAST SIDE apartment. Sydney has finally changed
     her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding
     cell. It is quiet in the apartment - faint street noise from
     3rd Avenue below.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               We need to leave. We need to run
               and we need to do it now. We can go
               to Estonia or Romania, I don't
               care, we'll take the cash from the
               bed and get out of here, alright?
               We talked about it a hundred times.
                                                36.


Irv stares at her and struggles.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What about Danny?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          What about Danny?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I adopted him! I gave him my name!
          I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn,
          she's unstable!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          That's a manipulation! Rosalyn's
          will never let you go. She'll use
          Danny against you because she's too
          messed up to let you leave.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't leave him. I love him.
          Alright? He's my son.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Richie said you would say that.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Richie? What, the cop? Your on a
          first name basis with him?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Yes I am. I'm not even on your list
          am I?

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          What list?

                     SYDNEY PROSSER
          Your list. Your short list. Your
          long list. I'm not even on anyone
          of your fucking lists. I thought
          you loved me. I thought we had
          something.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          We do have something. I love you,
          it's perfect! What are you saying?
          We're gonna go to Romania? We're
          gonna take Danny?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying.
          You, me, Danny.
                                                        37.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Well you never said that before.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I'm saying it now. We're us, and we
          can make it an adventure like we
          did. We can make it an adventure
          like we make everything, alright?
          But we have to go now. We have to
          leave right now.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't leave Danny. I'll lose
          custody.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          You have to take me away! We have
          to leave!


              (sobbing)
          What are you saying?! Oh my god.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What are you doing?! Please!

Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her
apartment. Irving follows.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I can't believe this is happening.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't say I don't love you because
          that's bullshit!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
              (sobbing)
          This is bullshit. You are bullshit.
          We are bullshit.

She starts sobbing, shaking.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Please don't do this.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I just never thought you were
          conning me.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I could never con you. I love you.
          Please don't say this.
                                                        38.


Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as
she sobs.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          No, I'm done.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't say that.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
              (cries)
          I'm gonna do these four busts,
          these four cons, to get us out of
          this. Not just me, but us. And
          I'm gonna get really close with
          Richie, the cop, in case we need to
          use him, if we need another move.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          We don't need another move. We need
          four busts, and we're done.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          We are going to need another move,
          trust me. And you're going to be
          thanking me. (shifts to British
          accent) The key to people is what
          they believe and what they want to
          believe and I want to believe that
          we were real, and I want to believe
          that a man could want me. And I'm
          gonna take all of that heartbreak,
          and all of that sorrow, and I am
          going to use it. And I'm going to
          make Richie think that I want him,
          and that I like him, and I'm going
          to be very convincing -- And I'm
          pissed at you.

Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face
lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
          Because I'm pissed at you!

Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her
like this before.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
          Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like
          him a lot. From the feet up right --
          baby?

Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.
                                                             39.


                         SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
               Quite your belly aching and come up
               with something to get us out of
               this. And you're right -- I'm in no
               state to deal with this so what's
               it gonna be, Mister Mastermind?

     SOUND PRELAP:

                         RICHIE DIMASO (O.S.)
69             An Arab sheik? Why do we need an                      69
               Arab Sheik?


70   INT. ART MUSEUM - DAY                                           70

     Richie, in sharp lapeled suit, chain on his neck, walks with
     Irv and Edith and joined by a man who looks like an ARAB
     SHEIK who they trail.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               How do you think this works,
               stupid?

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               If you could not call him `stupid'
               which he's isn't, he's smarter than
               you. Last I checked he's in control
               here and we work for him now so be
               nice.

     Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him.
     He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him
     in.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
                   (stares at her, upset)
               OK, to set this up and bust a con
               artist we have to make the honey
               pot to attract the bees. In order
               to attract the bees, we need to
               offer them a wealthy individual who
               can be taken advantage of, someone
               special, someone new, someone
               amazing. Then those guys will want
               to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy,
               take the sheik's money, see?

     Richie looks at Irving uncertain.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               Only they can't get into his money
               unless you they know someone, and
               that someone is us.
                                                           40.


                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Oh that's good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          So if you want to get somebody like
          your con artist friend -- Carl
          Elway -- you get him to want to buy-
          -

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Keep your voice down.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          -- or sell fake art or stolen art
          or fake certificates of deposit, he
          needs -- who does he need? -- he
          needs a rich sheik guy, and there
          you go -- we can pinch him!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Right, but I don't tell Elway shit.
          I wait for him to call me. The art
          world is a small world -- and one
          of Elway's acquaintances is
          clocking us right now.

Richie starts to look around.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Where?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't look.

Richie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man
balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          You have a good look?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          How do you know the Sheik?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          This is my friend Al from Queens.

                    AL FROM QUEENS/SHEIK
          I do aluminum siding and roofing.

Richie stares, impressed.
                                                        41.


INT. ART MUSEUM - NEXT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT
painting on the wall.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I want to show you something. This
          Rembrandt here? People come from
          all over the world to see this.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Yeah, he's good.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          It's a fake.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Wait, what're you talking about?
          That's impossible.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          People believe what they want to
          believe. Cause the guy who made
          this was so good that it's real to
          everybody. Now whose the master --
          the painter or the forger?

Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's a fake?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's the way the world works. Not
          black and white as you say.
          Extremely grey.

ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and
steps into the conversation.

                    ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE
          Irving can I --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          How many times I gotta tell you.
          You can't meet the sheik, alright?

Edith sees this and steps into the conversation.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met
          before.
                                                                42.


                          EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)
                I wanted to introduce you to Robert
                Spencer. We're advising the Sheik
                together.

      She looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                    (catching up)
                Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor
                to the sheik.


70A   EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL -- ESTABLISHING - DAY                        70A


71    INT. OFFICE OF CARL ELWAY - SUCCESSFUL, BUT SHADY - DAY         71

      CARL ELWAY, 40, preppie Waspy, very old fashioned with
      cigarette holder, but something vaguely criminal about him,
      in his conservative suit, natty white and red striped shirt,
      and navy blue tie sits with Irving.

                          CARL ELWAY
                What's this I hear about a god damn
                Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of
                this? I gotta hear about it from my
                friends?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                It ain't for you Carl.

                          CARL ELWAY
                What do you mean it ain't for me?
                We gotta do certificates of
                deposit. I can print as many as you
                need.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                This is not a one man operation.

                          CARL ELWAY
                Look, I can get other guys. What
                are you talking about Irving?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                You're telling me that you can get
                four guys to sell fake certificates
                of deposit to my investor within a
                week?

      The camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny
      microphone.
                                                        43.


                    CARL ELWAY
          Yes I can make that happen. Carl
          Elway can do what he says he's
          going to do.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's interesting but you know
          I've got other guys lined up. I've
          got a meeting with my associates.

SUDDENLY CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT, OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS.
Richie Dimaso and Edith ARE STANDING THERE -- MUCH TO IRV'S
DISMAY.

                    CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT
          Carl, his associates are here. He's
          got a meeting he's got to go to.

                    CARL ELWAY
          No wait. Don't go anywhere.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I've got to go.

Irving gets up to walk out as Richie and Edith stand in the
doorway.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          Crazy thing about people -- the
          more you say no, the more they want
          in on somethin. It is so stupid.


Irving looks over at Richie and Edith.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey
          you know what Carl just told me? He
          said he could do this whole thing
          with four guys within a week.

                    CARL ELWAY
          Or we could do somethin' much
          bigger!

Richie jumps into the conversation.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Something bigger? My guy deals with
          hundreds of millions of dollars.
          How much bigger?

He walks over to Carl.
                                                           44.


                    CARL ELWAY
          Hundreds of million -- I knew you
          were holdin' out on me Irving!
          Hundreds of millions of dollars?
          Like much bigger. Like I'm talking
          about we say never the fuck mind
          the CD's and we could have some
          complete access to something huge.

                     RICHIE DIMASO
          Huge? Like what? (introducing
          himself) Robert Spencer, advisor to
          the Sheik.

                    CARL ELWAY
          Carl Elway.

Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith,
DRESSED TO THE NINES.

                    CARL ELWAY (CONT'D)
          I want you to think of the most
          undervalued asset in the state of
          New Jersey today. The rebuilding of
          Atlantic City.

Richie looks over at Irving and Sydney and mouths the word
"WOW".

                    CARL ELWAY (CONT'D)
          Look, maybe they, maybe they
          legalized gambling a year ago but
          nothing's happening.

Irving interjects.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl.

                    CARL ELWAY
          I know the guy. I know the right
          people who are going to help you
          out.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Whose the guy?

                    CARL ELWAY
          The guy is Carmine Polito.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Whose Carmine Polito?
                                                             45.


75   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY                   75

     PUSH IN: STODDARD THORSEN, Richie's FBI supervisor.

                         STODDARD THORSEN
                   (shakes his finger `no')
               Carmine Polito? Carmine Polito, no.

     We freeze frame on Stoddard as we HEAR Richie'S VO:

     AS Richie TALKS WE SEE A SHORT FILM ABOUT Carmine Polito:

     - PUSH IN: Mayor Polito walks a Camden street waves, shakes
     hands of WELL-WISHERS

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell
               me that Carmine Polito was the most
               quietly powerful person in the
               state of New Jersey. A lifetime
               native of the very racially mixed
               Camden, which had become a ghetto,
               and where he had been Mayor for ten
               years. A very beloved guy. A guy
               who never gave up on his people.
               His father had emigrated from Italy
               and had stoked coal.

     - Frank Sinatras COFFEE SONG, 1940s version, as we see
     Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at
     breakfast.


                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               A big family guy with five kids.
               They even adopted some other kid.
               A black kid from the Boys and Girls
               Club who'd lost his family. I mean,
               his household was a joyous place.
               And his wife Dolly, she was the
               apple of his eye and the center of
               the household. I mean everyone
               loved this guy.

     - PULL OUT Mayor Polito walks up steps of City Hall as he

     couple of AIDES who show him papers to sign.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               And he had a huge heart.
                                                             46.


78   INT. CAMDEN CITY HALL - W.P.A. MURAL ROOM - DAY                78

                         CARMINE POLITO
                   (giving speech)
               The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to
               paint this during the Depression.
               Why can't we employ people today to
               do work like this in rebuilding
               Atlantic City?

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               He worked with all the unions. He
               was the leader of the State
               Assembly. And he had just gotten
               gambling legalized in New Jersey to
               create jobs.

80   -- FLOOR OF STATE ASSEMBLY -- Carmine huddles with other       80
     STATE LEGISLATORS, horsetrading and then poses for a picture
     with other members of the State Assembly.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               But he couldn't get the funds to
               rebuild Atlantic City and that was
               his problem. So with our help, he
               was about to have his hand in the
               wrong pocket at the wrong time.
               And to me that meant corrupt

81                                                     BACK TO:     81

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               You said grifters and con artists.
               We're not going after some
               politician. This is a bad idea,
               Richard.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Shhhh. Look, it's really simple.
               All you need is to put two million
               in a Chase account --

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               What?!

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               -- under the Sheik's name --

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               Whose two million?!
                                                  47.


                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Shh, just listen. Two million
          dollars under the Sheik's name, in
          a Chase account that we control.
          Carmine calls up on the telephone --
          calls the bank -- and he sees that
          the Sheik is real and he has a real
          account. Five days.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          I'm not taking two million dollars
          of the taxpayers' money and putting
          it anywhere for five days, I don't
          care if we control it the whole
          time.

Richie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Stoddard, let us do what we need to
          do to rule out corruption and to
          get rid of the payoff guys that are
          ruining this country. That's my
          dream. Don't smother it, please.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          You know Richard, I understand your
          eagerness. I really do. You know
          I'm from Michigan, right? Let me
          tell you a story about me, and my
          dad, and my brother. We used to go
          ice fishing every November. Ice
          Fishing. That's what we lived for.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Holy shit --

                     STODDARD THORSEN
          Just listen to me. It's beautiful.
          You have a little stove. You huddle
          around, you keep each other warm.
          You drop a line and you just wait.
          One year my brother says, "let's go
          in October." He wants to go ice
          fishing in October. My dad says,
          "No, the ice is too thin." My
          brother says -- I love my brother
          he says --
                                                             48.


                         RICHIE DIMASO
               I understand what's happening.
               You're saying your brother went out
               on the ice, the ice was too thin,
               he fell through the ice, he went in
               the water because he was too eager,
               and you're saying I'm too eager --
               that's what you're saying?

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               No, that's not what I'm saying.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               What are you saying?

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               We'll finish the ice fishing story
               another time, young man. For now,
               no Carmine Polito. Go do your job.

     Richie looks at him annoyed and upset.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               Stoddard shot the whole thing down.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Boring.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               But Edith was a genius.

83   SEE B-ROLL OF: Edith and Richie walk back into FBI building,   83

84   down corridor;                                                 84

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               She somehow found this woman who
               controlled the wire room. A woman
               I'd never heard of. Way back in a
               warren buried in the Bureau. This
               cat lady nobody even talked to.
               Edith met her in the ladies room
               and became friends with her. This
               lady handled all the wires and now,
               she was working with us.


                                                     SMASH TO:

85   Edith and Richie enter to find BRENDA, FBI, MATRONLY, OLDER;   85
     EDITH carries a basket of exotic teas;
                                                           49.


                     RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          She was excited to be included in
          an operation instead of being on
          the other end of a memo. It was
          beautiful.

Edith goes to hand her the PIMMS CUP and basket of teas.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Brenda, hi!

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON
          Hi!

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You said you liked exotic food, so
          that's from England.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON
          That's from England?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          That's right. And I brought you
          some tea as well.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON
          Thank you so much! Nobody ever
          tells me about these operations,
          they just say, "Brenda, do the
          clerical wiring work and don't ask
          questions."

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You need to tell Richie about your
          cats. He loves them.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON
          Oh my cats?!

Brenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to
the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON (CONT'D)
          Well that's Harry -- look at him
          standing up, isn't that sweet? And
          that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But
          Barnaby, that's another story.
          Barnaby plays the piano!

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's impressive.
                                                             50.


                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               We got her to wire two million
               dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled
               account at Chase. It'd be there
               for five days and if Polito called
               he'd see that the Sheik was real.


86   HALLWAY OF FBI                                                86

     Edith and Richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               By the time Stoddard caught up to
               us Edith made sure his boss was
               impressed by my idea. So before he
               even knew it was happening his boss
               was calling to congratulate him.

     PUSH IN ON CHIEF US PROSECUTOR, SPECIAL TASK FORCE, ANTHONY
     AMADO IN HIS LARGE OFFICE ON THE PHONE WITH STODDARD --

                         ANTHONY AMADO
               I'm very impressed. That was very
               smart. The Sheik with the money in
               the bank is a fantastic...don't be
               modest.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               Anthony Amado. He was the U.S.
               Attorney, and he had a major hard-
               on to make a name for himself. I
               mean this guy loved the idea of
               being famous. And Stoddard had to
               say it was his own idea or he'd
               look stupid in front of his boss.


     INT. STODDARD'S OFFICE --

89   PUSH IN ON STODDARD -- confused, dismayed.                    89

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik --


     INT. STODDARD'S OFFICE - DAY

     He hangs up, pissed, confused.
                                                                51.


                         STODDARD THORSEN
               You made me accept praise from my
               boss who's thanking me for
               something that never shoulda
               happened! Something that I didn't
               approve!

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               You should be happy. There's
               imaginative things happening in
               this office, alright? We're not
               just working in a box.

     Richie leaves triumphant.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               We got the two million to put
               Carmine and the Sheik together.

                         STODDARD THORSEN
               Punk.


90   INT. CORRIDOR OF FBI -- DAY                                      90

     Laughing Richie and Edith walk briskly on their way out.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
               I liked being on this side of the
               line. But someone had been left
               out.


91   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                    91

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               We succeeded because we stayed
               small. I got you Carl Elway. He
               bought stolen art, sold fake bank
               C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one.
               I get you three more -- no
               politicians.

     Richie and Edith look at him.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               You're gonna do this because you
               got no choice. You work for me.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Now you keep changing the rules.
               You're gettin' a little power
               drunk, Richard.
                         (MORE)
                                      52.

          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
You want to tell him, Edith? You
want to wake him up?

          EDITH GREENSLY
Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any
of it, Irving. You know I said
that. So now I support Richie.
He's got vision. Do it heavy or
don't do it.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
I mean, he's the one ruining
America, not me.

          RICHIE DIMASO
How the hell am I ruining America?

           IRVING ROSENFELD
Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, alright?
And you're gonna shit all over
politicians again? And just because
you want to be a big shot and get a
promotion.

          RICHIE DIMASO
No I'm thinking big. This is gonna
be fantastic. We're doing video
surveillance. I'm doing this from
the feet up.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
You will never do it properly
because you got too much government
attitude to be small and sleek.
I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man.
I'm in and I'm out. I was there the
whole time -- you don't know it.
That's the fucking art of becoming
somebody who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on. And
you can't do it.

          RICHIE DIMASO
How about a suite at the Sheraton
Hotel?

          IRVING ROSENFELD
For Carmine Polito and rebuilding
Atlantic City?

           RICHIE DIMASO
Why not?
                                                53.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You need a luxury hotel for the
          Sheik. Come on!

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Carmine does back door dealings all
          the time. We don't have a budget
          for that Irving!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You gotta knock the Mayor, the
          Speaker of the State Assembly --
          you gotta knock him off of his
          fucking feet. He's gotta feel like
          he's out of his league. What you're
          offering, this deal, I mean, this
          is unheard of in the state of New
          Jersey, maybe even the whole
          fucking country. A sheik with
          hundreds of millions of dollars to
          rebuild Atlantic City -- are you
          fuckin' kidding me? That's
          gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going
          to want to see cash, he's going to
          want to see it in an account, he's
          going to want to see it right now,
          and he will check. And that's why
          this meeting isn't happening,
          because to get millions, you need
          millions.

Edith listens intently.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
              (shrugs)
          We already did it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (stunned)
          What?

Irv studies Richie and Edith.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          We got the bureau to park 2 million
          for three days -- we got the
          account numbers.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          `We' meaning you and him?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Yeah we did it.
                                                        54.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Really?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Yeah, me and that guy.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          She showed me.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You showed him our thing? You did
          that without me? Are you kidding
          me?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          What are you going to do?


IRVING AND RICHIE LOOK AT SYDNEY, UNCERTAIN.

IRVING SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISGUST AND LEAVES. RICHIE STARES
AT SYDNEY SWINGING HER LEGS ON THE COUNTER AS SHE SITS.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You playing me? Are we doing this?
          Or you playing him? It'd be very
          bad for you if you're playing me.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You're going to have to decide for
          yourself, kid, I just laid
          everything out on the table.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          This is all very exciting, I never
          knew life could be like this.
          You're wild. You know we're taking
          down a very important politician.

Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she
sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls
her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,
makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is
intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.
They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is
thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.

                 This is agent Richard Dimaso, I'm
                 placing $75,000 into this briefcase
                 for Mayor Carmine Polito to procure
                 casino license and building permits
                 for Atlantic City.

     CLOSE ON MONEY COUNTED INTO BRIEFCASE --

     SMASH TO:

     IRVING'S EYES WIDEN AS WE CUT TO: Richie SLIDE THE BRIEFCASE
     OF CASH, AS SEEN BEFORE, Edith puts her hand on top of
     Richie's to stop him.

     IRV'S EYES WIDEN AS IN `NO! DON'T DO THAT!' WHILE HE AND
     RICHIE STARE AT EACH OTHER. CARMINE LOOKS DISTURBED AT THE
     CASE COMING HIS WAY. HE STANDS.


93   EXT. PLAZA HOTEL -- DAY                                         93

     Carmine Polito, upset, storms down the street as Irving
     catches up.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD
                 Mr. Mayor -- Please stop. Listen, I
                 apologize if that prick offended
                 you. I really apologize.

     Carmine will not turn around -- Irving catches up.

                           CARMINE POLITO
                 Really, I'm all right, thank you.
                 I'm okay.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD
                 No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be
                 associated with that guy at all.
                 Can I just say somethin' to you,
                 please? Don't lose this opportunity
                 to fuckin' Florida -- all right? --
                 because of some bullshit from that
                 punk advisor with his diploma who
                 could never get into the school
                 that we come from. Don't lose that
                 opportunity.
                                                        56.


                    CARMINE POLITO
          Where you from?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'm from the Bronx. Grand
          Concourse, Hundred and Sixty-fourth
          Street.

THIS REACHES CARMINE. HE AND IRV ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          I got a lot of friends that live up
          there. I go to Tomaso's on Arthur
          Avenue. You know Tomasos's?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yeah, Tomaso's.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          The spicy clams.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yes. They're always good.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Oh, they're to fucking die for,
          those clams. I haven't been there
          in a while. I like that place.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Carmine -- can I call you Carmine?
          You know, Carmine -- (catches his
          breath) My fuckin' heart's going
          from running down the stairs -- I'm
          not used to running. There's a
          lotta green grass in that hotel
          room up there, alright? And all the
          deals would float through you. You
          get a serious piece on both ends.
          You do with that what you will. I
          live in the real world, I am a
          family man, I got mouths to feed
          and everything. But, you know, we
          just...we gotta grease you
          directly. No middlemen, no
          bullshit. It's the Arab way.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Yeah, look, I understand. It's a
          great opportunity. It's just I got
          a little thrown by going to have a
          meeting with somebody who ended up
          not being there, so --
                                                            57.


                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.

                         CARMINE POLITO
               I understand. I'll deal with you
               directly. I don't want any
               middleman or any of that bullshit.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Done.

                         CARMINE POLITO
               I like you. Eye to eye. We can do
               business together.

     Irv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel
     together.

                         CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
               How long do you know this guy? You
               work with this guy before?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I gotta work with him. He's the
               Sheik's man.

                         CARMINE POLITO
               But I still need to meet the Sheik,
               okay?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Done.


94   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                94

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I'm going out to dinner with
               Carmine and the wives in Camden.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Who?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Carmine and myself and the wives.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               What?! Without me?!
                                      58.


          IRVING ROSENFELD
He doesn't like you, what do you
want from me, I got him to come
back and take the money and you got
him on tape alright? I can't make
him like you. I did my job.

          RICHIE DIMASO
Did you tell him you were working
with me? That I'm the Sheik's
associate?!

          IRVING ROSENFELD
I just fucking told you he doesn't
like you. I mean, let him have a
night out with a human being for
fuck's sake, he's going to jail
soon. You're done with him. You got
him on tape taking a bribe.

          RICHIE DIMASO
Carmine has got to deal with me,
Irving.

          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
We're gonna use Carmine. We're
gonna use Carmine to get other
people, that's what we're gonna do.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
What?! Like who?!

          RICHIE DIMASO
Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to
pay off people.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you
say--

          RICHIE DIMASO
We're gonna let Carmine show the
Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna
renovate hotels, and see who shows
up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for
licenses and casinos, that's who
we're gonna go after. We're gonna
go after all of 'em!

          IRVING ROSENFELD
More politicians? You realize how
fuckin' dangerous that is? There's
no fucking reasoning with you.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
               Edith and I were so successful for
               so long because we kept it just
               small enough. You are takin' us to
               a very fucking dangerous place,
               with very serious numbers!

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               If your that successful, how come
               you wound up in this room with me?
               Taking orders from me.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               You're taking your wife out to
               dinner? Your fucking wife? Did I
               just hear you correctly?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               That's the one thing you heard me
               say?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               I just find it rather shocking
               that's all.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I get to handle two wives with one
               dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn
               out, she keeps her mouth shut, she
               sees that my work is legitimate, I
               get to keep my kid, and I get to
               keep (pointing at Richie) that
               fucking wife happy. Both wives
               happy.

               Richard, the filter is broken in
               the fish tank. It's a problem.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               See, your job is to do the filter,
               Mom, mine is to do the gravel.
               When you don't do the filter right
               all the fish die. See?

Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just alone, you

That's right, he went out with
Carmine and his wife. You must not
feel so good about that.

Oh, you've got a fiancée. You're

               That's what that phone call's
               about. Everybody thought, "Oh,
               Richie DiMaso's gonna stay in the
               office, pushing papers." That's
               not gonna happen, Mom. I'm outside
               in the field. I got people working
               for me. My ideas. I'm running the

      Ella continues. Mixture of LOCALS: ITALIANS, POLISH, BLACKS
      AND PUERTO RICANS -- wave to the mayor from the bar, and
      tables, as Irv and Rosalyn follow.

100   THEY SIT AT BOOTH --                                            100

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Rocco, you know like we do. The
                chicken very thin. You should see
                the way he does this chicken with
                the red sauce

                          DOLLY POLITO
                It's beautiful.

                         CARMINE POLITO
                Right? With the red sauce, the
                lemon--

      Dolly kisses Carmine as he gives his wife's leg a squeeze and
      kisses her cheek, then her mouth.

      Irv and Rosalyn squeeze hands on the table. SHE KNOCKS BACK A
      GLASS OF RED WINE as a plate of Chicken Picatta is served to
      the table.

                          DOLLY POLITO
                It's the Piccata of the gods!

      She pulls away awkwardly, waiter refills her glass which she
      throws back right away. Irv looks concerned.

      They all drink.

101   CUT TO - LATER: Carmine and Irving talk.                        101

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                I believe that you should treat
                people the way that you want to be
                treated.

                             CARMINE POLITO
                Right.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Didn't Jesus say that or something?

                          CARMINE POLITO
                He may have.
                                                          64.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Also, always take a favor over
          money. I think Jesus said that as
          well.

                     CARMINE POLITO
               (laughing)
          I don't know if he said the second
          one but he may have said the first
          one.

CUT TO -- Rosalyn DRUNKENLY LEANS IN TALKING TO Dolly POLITO

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (shows her nails)
          I chip them moving furniture, it's
          my obsession -- Moving, re-
          decorating, it makes me feel better
          like exercise. There's this top
          coat that you can only get from
          Switzerland and I don't know what
          I'm going to do because I'm running
          out of it but I LOVE the smell of
          it.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          I can get that for you, of course.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          There's something, the topcoat,
          (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey
          but there's also something rotten?
          I know that sounds crazy, but I
          can't get enough of it.

Dolly laughs.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          No, smell it. It's true. Dolly,
          historically the best perfumes in
          the world, they're all laced with
          something nasty and foul. It's
          true!

She puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he
sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Irving loves them. He can't get
          enough of them.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't get enough.
                                                           65.


                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (hand out to Carmine)
          Carmine, sweet and sour. Rotten and
          delicious.

She leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's
nose.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Smells like flowers.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Flowers, but with garbage.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          You know what that is for me? It's
          coriander for me.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Irving loves it. He can't get
          enough. That's what hooks you. He
          always comes back for it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't stop.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (confidentially to Dolly)
          He's gonna say we have to talk
          business in five, four, three, two,
          one --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (to girls)
          Dolly, can me and the mayor talk
          business here?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (falling off her seat)
          AHH-HA-HAHAAAAAAAAHHHHH!

Carmine and Dolly rush to grab Rosalyn; JULIUS, Carmine's
steadfast AIDE, BLACK, 40, BIG SIDEBURNS, LOOSENED TIE and
white shirtsleeves, BIG SMILE, helps.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          No, don't do that it makes me look
          more drunk than I am! I'm not this
          drunk. Irving please don't make me
          go, I was just starting to have
          fun!

She WOBBLES INTO ARMS OF his WIFE Dolly, she and Carmine help
guide Rosalyn out.
                                                              66.


102   EXT. WEST 54TH STREET - NIGHT                                 102

      Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light" plays somewhere. Edith
      dressed in tight Halston dress, hair flows huge all round
      her; walks with Richie, who is waiting in a white gray suit
      with a white disco collar outside the lapel, chains around
      his neck.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                Didn't your fiance want to come out
                tonight?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Yeah, no, I don't know.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                I'm sorry, we don't have to talk
                about it. I was just teasing you.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Do you ever think, how did I end up
                here? How did my life become this?
                You ever think that? And you
                wonder, am I ever gonna get to a
                better place or is this it? You
                ever feel like that?

      Edith stares, nods yes.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                I do. I definitely know that.

      Edith nods puts a hand on his face.

                          EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry we don't have to go
                dancing. We can go have coffee or
                talk or something.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                No, I need this. Please, I need to
                go dancing with you.

      Richie reaches down and squeezes her hand.

                           RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
                Please.

103   Edith smiles.                                                 103

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                OK baby, let's go dancing.

      INT. DISCO - NIGHT
                                                                67.


      Richie and Edith DANCE AND DANCE AND SWEAT to Donna Summer's
      "I Feel Love" -- dance -- riding a high.

      Edith EXCUSES HERSELF to go to bathroom -- breaks away
      through crowd -- leaves Richie on dance floor -- then
      SUDDENLY BREAKS AWAY -- RUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD --


104   GETS TO THE LADIES ROOM JUST AS SYDNEY DOES --   HE PUSHES HER   104
      FROM BEHIND INTO A STALL -- SHE PUTS HER HANDS   ON THE TOP OF
      THE STALL WALL AS RICHIE RUNS HIS HANDS UP HER   LEGS FROM HER
      ANKLES AND UNDER HER DRESS - SHE LEANS HER ASS   BACK INTO IT
      ARCHES HER BACK --

      SUDDENLY RICHIE STOPS, throws himself back against the other
      stall wall, out of breath. Edith LOOKS OVER HER SHOULDER --

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I really fucking like you.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                I like you too. I want to live,
                alright. For real. No more fake
                shit. Alright?

      She get's real close to his face, almost about to kiss.

                          EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)
                We're going to wait until we decide
                to go for love Richie. For real.
                That's when we fuck. Not till then,
                ok?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                OK.

                          GIRL OUTSIDE STALL (O.S.)
                Are you gonna fuck for real or get
                out of the stall for real?

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                No more fake shit.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                No more fake shit.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                No more fake shit!

                          GIRL OUTSIDE STALL
                Fuck me I gotta piss!

      The girl outside the stall bangs on the door.
                                                              68.


      She holds his mouth in one hand and leans in and kisses him -
      they get lost --

                            EDITH GREENSLY
                Get out!

      SHE SHOVES HIM OUT OF THE STALL, LOCKS IT.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                    (outside stall)
                I want to be fucking real!

      RICHIE LAUGHS MANICALLY EXCITED AS HE STANDS AMID MANY WOMEN
      WHO SHOVE HIM OUT THE DOOR. IN THE STALL SYD SITS
      EXHILARANTLY AND THROWS HER HEAD BACK LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY -
      GIDDY.

                            EDITH GREENSLY
                AHHHHHHH!

      RAUNCHOUSLY HAPPY GROUP OF locals.

      INT. BARON'S BACK ROOM- CAMDEN SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT - LATER

      Carmine puts down glass of bourbon as he addresses everyone
      emotionally as he looks at Irving.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                    (to Julius)
                This guy right here, Irving
                Rosenfeld? You know what he's gonna
                do? He's gonna bring the Sheik to
                Atlantic City, where we can rebuild
                all those resorts there, put
                everybody back to work.

      Irving stares and is moved by this. Tears come to his eyes,
      he feels bad about it all suddenly.

                          CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
                He's gonna get this community --
                he's gonna get this state -- back
                on its feet where it belongs. Isn't
                that right?

                          CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
                He's gonna grow our tax base and
                create thousands and thousands of
                jobs for everyone. You understand
                that? You know what that means?

                             JULIUS
                To Irving.

                             GIRLS
                To Irving!

      Carmine sits down on the couch next to Irving.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                This guy right here. He's got a big
                heart.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD
                     (quietly)
                I'd just hate it if it didn't work
                out.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                What do you mean? Of course it's
                going to work out. Guys like you
                and me? We dream and we build. We
                never give up. We never quit.

107   QUIET -- INT. DINER - MORNING                                 107

      Irv and Carmine eat breakfast.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Can I ask you a question.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD
                Sure.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Is the sheik black?

      Irving looks flummoxed.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                He's an Arab.

      They look at each other.
                                                              70.


                          CARMINE POLITO
                That's black, isn't it?

      Irv isn't sure what to say.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Why you asking?

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Maybe it's a dumb question, but I
                was just wondering -- I would like
                to arrange for the Sheik to see
                Camden. To see the people of
                Camden. The people I serve. The
                people I love. Who are mostly black
                and Puerto Rican. I really want him
                to see how good this is going to be
                for the community, how ready we are
                for this opportunity, and he can
                see how far his dollar will go.
                You know what I mean? What do you
                think?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Yeah we can do that. He can see
                Camden.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                    (relieved)
                Hey, I got something I wanna give
                to you.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                For me?

                          CARMINE POLITO
                I got you a gift. Let's get out of
                here. The girls are going to kill
                us I'm sure.

108   EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - MORNING                              108

      They walk in the morning sun to Carmine's Lincoln where he
      opens the trunk and they stare at what is inside.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                What is it?
                                                              71.


                          CARMINE POLITO
                It's a microwave. It heats up
                everything. Pasta, lasagna,
                meatballs, whatever.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD
                Really?

                          CARMINE POLITO
                It's science, yeah. That's how it
                heats up the food. It's scientific.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                And you specifically bought this
                science oven for me.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                    (Carmine stares
                     meaningfully at Irv)
                Yes. A new friend.

      Irv is touched. He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine,
      because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD
                Thank you.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Don't put metal in it. Come on,
                let's get out of here.

      EXT. FBI BUILDING - DAY

                          RICHIE DIMASO (O.S.)
                I need a jet at Teeterboro.


109   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            109



                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I need a jet at Teeterboro for the
                sheik.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                You don't need a jet. Let him walk
                to the curb at JFK.
                                                              72.


                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Stoddard, that's not how it works.
                You got to do it from the feet up.

                           STODDARD THORSEN
                That doesn't mean anything. What's
                that mean?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                It means you gotta be committed!
                It means you gotta be committed to
                something in your life, for
                Christ's sake. I want a jet at
                Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be
                a small jet. It doesn't even have
                to take off, cause I know you're so
                worried about how much money the
                Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It
                can take off and land on the
                tarmac, okay?

                           STODDARD THORSEN
                Alright, you can have a jet for an
                hour, but it takes off and lands at
                Teterboro.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I got the jet?

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                You got the jet.

                             RICHIE DIMASO
110             Thank you.                                            110

      Richie goes to walk out of Stoddard's office but stops at the
      door.

                          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
                So tell me the rest of the ice
                fishing story.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                Where was I?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Your father woke you up, it was a
                blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come
                on!
                                                               73.


                          STODDARD THORSEN
                Okay, well, my brother and I were
                on the ice and my father came out
                of the house and I could see him
                coming. He was holding a lantern,
                and it was in the blizzard and I
                knew he was gonna be angry. So I
                went to intercept my father because
                I knew if he saw what my brother
                was doing he was going to kill him.

      Richie cuts him off.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                So you tried to protect your
                brother, but you couldn't and
                that's why you feel bad, because
                you're trying to protect me and
                you're worried about me. Is that
                what the story's about? About
                protection?

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                No, it's not about protection.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                It's not about protection?

                             STODDARD THORSEN
                No.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Alright, fine.

      Richie walks out the door.


111   INT. ROSALYN'S KITCHEN - DAY                                   111

      Ros talks to herself carrying tin foil covered tray of
      lasagna.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                    (to herself)
                "Don't put metal in the science
                oven, don't put metal in the
                science oven, Rosalyn"...always
                treats me like a fucking child.
                I'll do whatever I want.

      She puts the tin foil lasagna into microwave. After a few
      moments it sparks, explodes into flames. DANNY RUNS IN.
                                                  74.


                      DANNY
                (runs in)
            Another fire!

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                (grabbing a fire
                 extinguisher)
            No, Danny, not that one! That one's
            empty! We gotta use the big one!

SMASH TO:

                      IRVING ROSENFELD
            I told you not to put metal in the
            science oven. Why did you do that
            for?

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD
            Don't make such a big deal. Just
            get another one.

                      IRVING ROSENFELD
            I don't want another one. I want
            the one that Carmine gave me.

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD
            "I want the one Carmine gave me!"
            Carmine, Carmine, why don't you
            just marry Carmine, get a little
            gold microwave and put it on a
            chain around your neck. You want to
            be more like Carmine? Why don't you
            build something like he does,
            instead of all your empty deals
            that are just like your fucking
            science oven. You know I read that
            it takes all of the nutrition out
            of our food. It's empty, just like
            your deals. Empty, empty!


                      IRVING ROSENFELD
            That's bullshit.

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD
            It's not bullshit. I read it in an
            article. Look, by Paul Brodeur.
                                                                75.


      SHE HANDS HIM THE MAGAZINE.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                Bring something into this house
                that's gonna take all the nutrition
                out of our food and then light our
                house on fire? Thank God for me.

      Ros stares defiantly, clicks her nails on the counter. PRE-
      LAP JET ROAR, IRVING STARES AT ROS and BURNED OVEN and looks
      at the magazine article.


112   EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT TARMAC, NEW JERSEY - DAY                112

      JET ROAR LANDING. A small airport. Irv stands alone, staring
      at Edith and Richie kissing. Richie, in long full length
      fleece lined suede coat, walks over towards where Carmine
      stands.

                                                         CUT TO:


113   IRV AND SYDNEY WALKING ACROSS TARMAC.                           113

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                I don't think you should come to
                Carmine's party tonight. You look
                beautiful by the way.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                Don't look at me. Don't look at my
                legs, don't look at my hair, don't
                smell my hair, don't ask me how I
                am, don't talk to me outside of
                these roles, 'cause we're done.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                What are you doing? Get under the
                umbrella. It's just that Carmine
                wants Rosalyn to come.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                I don't care. You weren't
                listening. I don't care if Rosalyn
                comes. Just do your job, okay?
                You're nothing to me until you're
                everything. I'm not Rosalyn. I'm
                not gonna put up with that shit.

      THEY ARRIVE AT Richie as the JET arrives on the tarmac.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Now that's a fucking jet right?
                                                        76.


                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          It's good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's the kinda moves you need to
          make.

They walk towards the Jet and walk on leaving Carmine and
Edith waiting outside.


INT. PRIVATE JET - CONTINUOUS

Irv and Richie step aboard to find FBI AGENT PACO HERNANDEZ
putting on a regal looking white Arab keffyeh headdress and
robe -- he looks noble. TWO AGENTS posing as body guards.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Paco, Richie Dimaso, good to meet
          you in person [shakes Paco's hand] -
          this is Irving Rosenfeld.

Irv nods to Paco and the other agents.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          Paco Hernandez. Nice to meet you.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Paco? He's--wait, he's not a real
          Arab.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          No. I'm Mexican. From Tuscon.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Wait, where's my guy? Where's Al
          from Queens?

                       RICHIE DIMASO
          Who?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          My friend from Queens. Where is he?
          What are you doing?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I gotta hire an F.B.I. guy.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What are you-- (to Paco) You speak
          any Arabic?

                     PACO HERNANDEZ
          Yeah.   Abdullah Ahmed.
                                                        77.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's it? That's all you got?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          No, I have a couple phrases.

Irving isn't sure, looks Paco up and down.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (to Richie) From the feet up, you
          motherfucker. What are you doing?
          (to Paco) Act normal. That's it.
          Like you can barely understand
          English. You can't speak it. You
          say as little as possible. You
          follow my lead. Alright?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          (to Richie) Who's running this?    I
          thought you were running it.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I am running this but you've gotta
          listen to him. He's the guy with
          the vision.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I've got the vision? You know what
          vision I had? You just kissing my
          girl outside. That's what vision I
          had.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (stares at Irving)
          I thought you guys broke up. I'm
          giving you a compliment.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          What's going on?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Don't worry about it.

Irving takes a expensive looking ceremonial knife out of his
jacket pocket and holds it out to Paco.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You got a knife. This is for the
          Mayor. You've got to present it to
          him. Look me in the eye. This means
          a lot to you. Right? That knife.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          OK.
                                               78.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Play it. You present it.
          "Friendship for life," alright?
          You gotta feel it. Sacred. Can you
          do it?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          Right. Sacred.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You gotta sell it.

                     RICHIE DIMASO
          Sell it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          If you believe it's sacred, it's
          sacred.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Listen to what he's saying.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Can you do it?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          It's the details. That's what
          makes this guy a genius.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Again? You compliment me again.
          What is this, rubbing salt in the
          wound?

Irving stares incredulously.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I'm complimenting you. (to Paco)
          Any other questions?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          Yeah, I think the name of this
          operation is offensive.

                     RICHIE DIMASO
          What?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ
          Abscam. "Arab Scam?" It's racist.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Are you fucking kidding? What do
          you care? You're Mexican.
                                                                 79.


115   EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY                              115

      ELO's "10538 Overture" kicks on. Irv and Richie exit the
      plane walking slightly behind the "sheik" and his
      "bodyguards" - the sheik in the front.

      The Sheik hands the ceremonial knife to Carmine and bows his
      head --

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome.
                On behalf of the great state of New
                Jersey I want to welcome you to New
                Jersey. I know that was redundant.
                I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous.

116   Carmine takes the knife and looks to the others excitedly.       116

                          CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
                (to "shiek")
                We have a great party planned for
                you this evening.


118   INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             118

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                    (half dressed)
                But what are you talking about, I
                can't go? I just did my hair and
                makeup and everything!

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                The Sheik's very particular. It's
                international cultural protocol.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                International protocol? What the
                fuck are you talking about?

      PHONE RINGS --

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Do not answer that!

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                    (answers phone)
                Hello -- Robert Spencer? I don't
                know a Robert Spencer. What do you
                want?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                    (takes phone)
                Give it to me.
                                                         80.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Who is that?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (into the phone)
          Look, I told you, for God's sake, I
          told you not to call here.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          What is that about?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (on phone)
          Two more federal agents tonight,
          OK?

Ros leaves the room.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          No way.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Yes. They're bodyguards for the
          Sheik.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's too many people for me to
          control, no.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Look. I'm in charge here, alright?
          Just do it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Rosalyn, get off the extension!

                                                    PAN TO:


REVEAL ROSALYN IN KITCHEN LISTENING ON THE PHONE.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (hangs up)
          I'm not on it!

But she was on it. She heard.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Look, don't call here again,
          alright? Don't call at home.

                       RICHIE DIMASO
          Alright?
                                                        81.


                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          OK.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Good night.

He HANGS UP and walks into the kitchen. Rosalyn looks at him.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Federal agents?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          It's bodyguards for the visiting
          dignitary, that's all.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          What is it, an I.R.S. thing?     Like
          a tax investigation?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Why you gotta say that? I mean,
          that's why I can't invite you.
          It's too complicated. Listen, come
          on.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Are you in trouble?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Look, stop being so nosy.

Irving opens the fridge which is a mess.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Look at this shit.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm only nosy cause you never tell
          me anything.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Can we clean up this fridge? I
          mean, what are you causing trouble
          for all the time?

PHONE RINGS AGAIN.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          DO NOT ANSWER THAT--

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (picks up phone)
          HEL-LO- Oh, hi, Carmine. We were
          just talking about you.
                    (MORE)
                                                           82.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Irving's being a mean, boring man
          saying that he doesn't want me to
          come tonight.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          (on phone)Tell him he's crazy!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Well, I agree. Want to tell him
          yourself?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Gimme the phone, come on.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          It wouldn't be a party without you!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Can you imagine? Tell him yourself.

She hands the phone to a very exasperated, anxious, Irv.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (into telephone) Hey, Carmie.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Irving, you're crazy! Your wife is
          coming, you kidding me? She's the
          life of the party! Everybody loves
          her.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm the life of the party!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (confidential into phone)
          Look, you know what she's like.
          She's unpredictable. She's just
          always --

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Hey, don't talk about me like that!
          What's Carmine saying?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't hear what he's saying.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Listen, Irving, it's very important
          that she come, you understand?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Carmine loves me.
                                                        83.


                    CARMINE POLITO
              (on phone)
          This is a really big night for us,
          you understand? Come on, you gotta
          bring your wife. And Dolly's got
          somethin' special for her.

Dolly is getting dressed for the party in the background.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Tell her I got the nail polish for
          her.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          See? Listen!

                    DOLLY POLITO
          (raising her voice to phone) I got
          your nail polish for you, sweetie!

                    CARMINE POLITO
          You see? Somethin' special for
          you. What is it? Tell me. I mean,
          (lowers his voice, conspiratorial)
          What is it, you got a girlfriend
          coming? Come on, I thought we were
          friends. You're not gonna tell me
          you got a girlfriend? This is
          ridiculous.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          No, it's just Rosalyn's
          unpredictable.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Look, we're gonna handle this like
          men, you understand? You're
          bringing your wife. We're gonna
          have a good time. That's an order
          from the Mayor. Good-bye.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (to Rosalyn) Alright, you happy?
          Go get ready.

Irv hangs up and exits the kitchen.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Yes, I am happy.
                                                              84.


119   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - DUSK                                      119

      Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" plays on the
      soundtrack as Irv drives: tinted glasses, large comb over,
      blue crushed velvet suit, dark tie -- PAN TO:

      VISOR MIRROR -- WHERE Rosalyn APPLIES MASCARA --

      SMASH TO:


120   EXT. GRAND OLD ATLANTIC CITY HOTEL - NIGHT                      120

      Elton John continues as Carmine LIGHTS A CIGARETTE in a two-
      toned GRAY AND BLACK TUXEDO, at the center of a haphazard red
      carpet situation in front of a has-been beach resort -- large
      old movie premiere spotlights rotate onto the facade in an
      assorted CROWD OF LOCALS some dressed up -

      JULIUS, CARMINE, TITO, MELORA (Carmine's STEADFAST AIDES)
      son DOMINIC, daughter LUCILLE, wife Dolly, assorted COPS,
      FIREMEN IN FORMAL UNIFORMS WHITE GLOVES, UNION GUYS in suits,
      fringe the area. Carmine 's family is dressed up.

      IRV'S CAR PULLS UP AND A FAT VALET IN RED OPENS DOOR. ROSALYN
      GETS OUT IN HER WHITE DRESS --

      DOLLY HANDS ROSALYN A TINY SHOPPING BAG WITH SWISS NAIL
      PRODUCTS. ROSALYN OPENS A LITTLE BOTTLE OF NAIL FINISH AND
      SHRIEKS IN ECSTACY.

      Greets everyone.

      LIMO PULLS UP: FLASHBULBS GO OFF -- SUDDENLY THE SPOT LIGHT
      JAMS WITH GRINDING SOUND, LAMP EXPLODES IN SMOKE --

      THROUGH THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE STEPS: Richie IN A WHITE
      SUIT, Edith stunning SILVER METALLIC Halston dress, WHITE FUR
      COAT --

      THE SHEIK STEPS OUT OF HIS LIMO, IN A BLACK FORMAL ARAB
      DRESS, WITH AN ARABIC OR HISPANIC LOOKING FBI AGENT WE SAW ON
      THE PLANE DRESSED AS HIS BODY GUARD IN BLACK WITH BLACK
      SUNGLASSES.

      ACROSS THE RED CARPET -- ROSALYN AND SYDNEY SEE EACH OTHER
      FOR ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES -- LOCK EYES. ROSALYN HUGS IRV'S
      ARM --

                            ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                      (to Edith, glaring)
                  I know who you are.
                                                              85.


      Irv tries to turn Rosalyn away, but she keeps turning back
      giving Edith the hairy eyeball, as Edith gives it right back.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
                I know who that is Irving.

      Off to the side, Richie steels himself with bump of cocaine
      before walking inside the old resort, his eyes dilate.


121   INT. LOBBY OF GRAND OLD SEASIDE HOTEL - NIGHT                   121

      The entourage walks through the ornate lobby as Edith and
      Rosalyn continue to eyeball each other with Irv uncomfortably
      in the middle as Carmine ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES HIS
      PRESENTATION FOR THE SHEIK.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                So this is the lobby. Now mind you,
                a week ago this place was a mess,
                but what existed was this
                plasterwork. Look at the detail.
                This is beautiful. My sons are
                craftsmen. (to son, Dominic)
                Please, tell them what you did.

                          DOLLY POLITO
                Tell them everything you know. The
                trompe l'oeil.

                          DOMINIC POLITO
                Birds, sky, clouds, wood. Trompe
                l'oeil -- "Trick of the eye."

                          CARMINE POLITO
                We can restore all of this, you
                see? You save 50 million -- look at
                me -- fifty million right off the
                bat -- I waive the law I helped
                write. It said casino construction
                must be ground up new, we don't do
                new. We renovate.

                          DOLLY POLITO
                We don't do new. We renovate.

      Carmine leads all of them through the very crowded lobby as
      he talks.

      Irving listens intently, moved.
                                                                86.


122   INT. DOWNSTAIRS CASINO - CONTINUOUS                             122

      200 PEOPLE ARE GATHERED around blackjack, roulette, and craps
      tables, playing and having a good time.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                We put in some temporary fun --
                some gaming tables, some play money
                for people to have a good time. For
                charity -- the Boys and Girls Club
                and some arts programs.

      Rosalyn walking with Irving, continues to stare daggers at
      Edith, who stays close to Richie.


      Carmine, Julius, Melora, CONTINUE TO LEAD EVERYONE INTO


123   INT. THE OCEAN ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                               123

      Carmine continues to walk --

                          CARMINE POLITO
                This is the Ocean Room --

      He pushes open double upholstered old doors --


      THEY ENTER THE LARGE CROWDED YET INTIMATE BEMELMANS STYLE BAR

      The bar -- LIKE THE BEMELMANS BAR AT THE CARLYLE HOTEL IN
      MANHATTAN - IS LARGE YET INTIMATE -- THERE ARE 50 DRESSED UP
      CITIZENS THERE DRINKING -- AND A CROWDED LONG BAR -- AND
      ANOTHER SMALLER BAR ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM ---

      Carmine pauses to stare at the MEN AT THE FAR BAR -- FIVE MEN
      IN SUITS, 40 TO 60, SLIGHTLY MOB-LOOKING.

      AS Irv IS PULLED ASIDE CONFIDENTIALLY BY Carmine -- Richie
      AND Edith WATCH -- Rosalyn STANDS TO THE SIDE -- Carmine
      puts his arm around Irv's shoulders --

                          CARMINE POLITO
                There are some gentlemen over there
                at the bar. That's a hundred and
                thirty years sitting there --
                that's how much time's between
                them. They run the biggest casinos
                in the United States. We have to
                work with them.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Right.
                                                        87.


                    CARMINE POLITO
          The good news is they know how it's
          done. They get it done. You don't
          have to worry. Everyone makes their
          money.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You mean the Mob?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Yes, but they're businessmen, okay?
          Now, spend as much or as little
          time with them as you like, but we
          do have to deal with them. All
          we've got to do is go say hello.
          We just gotta say hi, that's all.

Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND
ADRENALINE --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure
          that's such a good idea. We gotta
          confer before we talk to these
          guys.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (interrupting, hopped up)
          Confer? What is there to confer
          about? They're casino guys.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          They are businessmen.

                     RICHIE DIMASO
          We came all this way, Irving. We
          should be here. What's everybody
          scared of? There's nothing to be
          scared of.

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is
starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks
increasingly uncomfortable.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (re: the mob guys)
          Those are the guys you're all
          scared of? Those guys over there?
          They don't scare me.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Rosalyn!
                                                        88.


But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar
who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine
watch.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I love this!

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits
down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND
PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a
glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Hi.   Can I sit here?

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the
Mafia guys.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Irving, this is not a good idea.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          How you guys doing? Everybody over
          there is really scared of you guys,
          you know that?

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Kids, I want you to go up and get
          some pizza and soda, please.

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          It's a disaster.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I think they have this room all
          wrong.

                    PETE MUSANE
          Yeah? What would you do?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I would do it in all black and gold
          and I would do this bar like a big,
          warm golden mirror.

                    DICK HELSING
          Sounds beautiful.
                                                          89.


                       ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Thank you.

Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters.

                    PETE MUSANE
          But you expect that from her
          because she's so beautiful --

                       ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Oh stop.

                       DICK HELSING
          Gorgeous.

                    PETE MUSANE
          I love her hair, so I know I'm
          gonna love how she'd do the room --

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.
Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          How do you do?

                    PETE MUSANE
              (to Richie)
          I'm sorry is she your wife?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          No, she's my wife. She's my wife.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Look at these fine gentleman.

                    PETE MUSANE
          Carmine, there you are.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          How you doing?

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and
puts it on table.

                    PETE MUSANE AND GUYS
          Ohhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!

                    ROSALYN
          It's because he's a party pooper.
          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and
forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in
his hand. He knows how to fake it.
                                                           90.


                    PETE MUSANE
          You have a very beautiful wife.

                    DICK HELSING, ROSALYN ROSENFELD, OTHER
                    GUYS
          Salud.

THE MADE GUYS LAUGH. SYD ROLLS HER EYES. IRVING, CARMINE
STARE WITH TENSION.

THEY ALL LAUGH. RICHIE GUIDES SHEIK with ONE BODY GUARD.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          May I present Sheik Abdullah,
          gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,
          these men are professionals, they
          run the best casinos in the United
          States.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely
uncomfortable.

                    PETE MUSANE
          Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our
          seriousness, Mr. Tallegio came from
          Miami to meet you tonight.

HEAVY PAUSE.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Mr. Tallegio? Why didn't you tell
          me Mr. Tallegio was here?

                    PETE MUSANE
          He's in the back room.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          It's a sign of disrespect to do
          business on the first meeting.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's not true. I don't know what
          your talking about. (to Musane)
          He's got it all wrong.

                    DICK HELSING
          Well, don't leave him back there in
          the back room waiting. Come on,
          let's go.

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing
when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress
and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.
                                                               91.


                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                 Hey Irving, I'm going to be having
                 fun. Maybe it will be contagious.


       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with
       Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn
       with Musane, decides to hang back.

       LIGHT GRAY SUIT, DARK TIE -- STANDING BY HIMSELF.

       CARMINE, RICHIE, SHEIK, IRVING ENTER A HALF FINISHED BACK

                             VICTOR TELLEGIO
                 Carmine!

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He
                 was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man.
                 In his prior reputation as an
                 enforcer from twenty years ago, he
                 was known to never bury a body
                 because he felt it sent a stronger
                 message to leave it in the street.

                                                  FLASH BACK TO:

       TO:

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 This is the guy we now had to deal
                 with.



125B   INT. CASINO BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              125B

       RESUME PUSH IN ON TELLEGIO AS A COUPLE OF BUSBOYS SET UP AN
       IMPROMPTU TABLE AND CHAIRS. Carmine greets him.
                                                        92.


                    CARMINE POLITO
          You sure you don't want to go into
          the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's
          beautiful in there.

                    VICTOR   TELLEGIO
          I'm very happy I   don't have to go
          there. I like it   here. There's an
          exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody
          knows I'm here.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to
Richie.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          Tell him I speak for our friends in
          Florida. We're very excited. It's
          been our lifelong dream to build
          casino resorts on the East Coast.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          You told him that? They didn't want
          the Jews to make money, they didn't
          want the Italians to make money,
          definitely don't want the blacks to
          make money. After the oil embargo --
          the gasoline crisis -- the
          hijackings, the Olympics, they
          don't want to see Arabs make money,
          trust me, not on our soil. You can
          tell him this in your own way: I've
          been in the casino business forty
          years. It's scrutinized more
          carefully than any other business.
          Carmine made this legal, but we
          must be careful or they'll take it
          away.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          So, Mister Tellegio, how do you
          think we should approach this? What
          do you want to do?

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          If you want to get the gaming
          license and keep it we have to make
          our principal investor here, the
          Sheik, an American citizen.
                                                           93.


Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure
where this is going.

                     CARMINE POLITO
          To expedite citizenship -- well,
          that requires very special
          treatment.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          You would know the right people to
          do that, Carmine.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Carmine knows everybody.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What are we talking about?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          U.S. Senators. Congressmen.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Wow, that's fantastic.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I say stay away from that. That's
          bad. That's trouble. No, that's not
          good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Irving please.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's trouble.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Who is this guy? (to Irving) What
          are you, a farmer?

Richie and Tellegio both laugh.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is
          Irving. New York businessman.
          Irving Rosenfeld.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Irving, Irving. What's the matter,
          Irving? What's the problem?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Nothing. No problem.
                                                        94.


                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Don't get your balls in an uproar.
          Everything's fine, everything's
          good. It's all good. It's all good.
          I just hope the other part of this
          is all good. And real. Because
          we're real. You know that. You deal
          with us. We're a real organization.
          We deal with you, we don't know
          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --

                    VICTOR TALLEGIO
          Where's he from?

                     RICHIE DIMASO
              (winging it)
          Abu Dhabi.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Oh, he's from the Emirates.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Yeah.

                     VICTOR TELLEGIO
              (in subtitled Arabic)
          (Can I count on you? You gotta be
          honest about this. Do you
          understand me? Good means good. No
          bullshit.)

PUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE.
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

                     VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          (to Sheik)
          (Did you hear what I said? Do you
          want me to repeat it?)

Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          (What do you think now? Tell me.
          Tell me.)

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Uh, I think, I think what he's --
                                                        95.


                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          No, let him speak for himself.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense
moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          No, I know him.

                    AL KOWALSKI
          You guys are way too serious for a
          party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are
          you drinking? You got a drink?

TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.


                    CARMINE
              (to Al)
          We're in a very serious meeting.
          (to Tellegio) I apologize.

TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED.

                    AL KALOWSKI
          I understand, you're in conference.
          You gotta come with me now. You got
          a speech to give. Everyone's
          waiting for you.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?
          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS
INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

                    SHEIK ABDULLAH
              (In Arabic)
          It is great doing business with
          you. The investment is real. It was
          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
passable in Arabic.
                                                        96.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          What are the odds of an Italian guy
          from Miami knowing Arabic? But it
          turns out he's got casino
          investments in the Mideast and he
          spent two years learning it to keep
          the upper hand.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Listen to me carefully. If you're
          real, you put ten million in the
          bank of our choice in the next two
          weeks.

Carmine nods.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          Carmine, listen to me carefully, if
          you're real, you put ten million in
          the bank of our choice in the next
          two weeks or not only will the
          Sheik feel insulted, but our
          friends in Florida will feel deeply
          disrespected and so will I.

Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad.

AT THE BAR --

"WHITE RABBIT" CONTINUES. ROSALYN CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH
PETE MUSANE --

SYDNEY WATCHES OUT OF CONTROL ROSALYN, STANDS AND WALKS OVER
TO HER.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Rosalyn, you need to come with me
          alright?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I don't need to come with you.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You need to come with me. This
          needs to stop. Come on.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Oh, you think I should come with
          you?
                                                        97.


                     EDITH GREENSLY
          Yeah, you need to come with me
          right now.

Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Why don't you get your fucking
          hands off me, you fucking whore!

                    PETE MUSANE
          Hey!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You're a whore. (to everyone) This
          is my husband's whore!

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          That's real nice.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          We're not going to do this in the
          Ocean Room tonight. Not tonight.
          Please.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          This is my husbands whore!

Dolly escorts Edith over to one side of the room away from
Rosalyn.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          You stay over here with me.
          Everybody just calm down. I don't
          know what's going on.

Pete looks over to Rosalyn.

                    PETE MUSANE
          You alright? Take it easy. These
          things happen. Whatever's meant to
          be will be.

Rosalyn smiles at Pete.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          That's what I always say.

                    PETE MUSANE
          You say that?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Yeah.
                                                              98.


                          PETE MUSANE
                See? Kindred spirits.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                Whatever's meant to be will be.

                          PETE MUSANE
                Whatever's meant to be will be.

                                                        CUT TO:


      INT. WOMEN'S POWDER ROOM HALLWAY - CASINO

      ROSALYN STORMS DOWN THE HALL TOWARDS THE BATHROOM AS "WHITE
      RABBIT" BUILDS TO ITS CLIMAX.


126   INT. WOMEN'S POWDER ROOM - CASINO                             126

      Rosalyn looks in mirror: sadness, anger, fear. Edith rushes
      in.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                What the hell do I think I'm
                doing?! What the fuck do you think
                you're doing? You really gonna come
                in here and judge me for flirting
                with somebody after you've been
                fucking my husband for how many
                years?!

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                You don't have any fucking clue
                what's going on!

      Rosalyn holds her hand, with wedding ring to Sydney's face.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                I got a ring on my finger. We have
                a child together.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                He doesn't love you Rosalyn he
                loves me. And you know it and I
                know it and he knows it. And it
                might be done now, but it was
                beautiful and it was real.
                                                        99.


                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Stop.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          And we loved each other.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Shut up.

Rosalyn starts to tear up.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          You scare him, and you manipulate
          him, and you use your son!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Well, he must like it on some
          level. He must want it because he
          keeps coming back for it. It's like
          that perfume that you love that you
          can't stop smelling, even when
          there's something sour in it. You
          can't get enough of it. But guess
          what, he's never gonna leave me.
          He's always going to want me, and I
          will make you so sorry, Edith. I
          will make you so sorry for what
          you've done to my family, mark my
          words.

                     EDITH GREENSLY
          That is fucked up! I would never
          say anything that fucked up to
          anybody, but you do because you're
          gross inside, you're so fucked up
          and gross.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Oh, I'm gross inside?

                     EDITH GREENSLY
          Yeah.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Maybe you're gross inside, with
          robbing people and all that shit
          that you do? Maybe we're both gross
          inside, that's what Irving loves
          about us. At least he's consistent
          with his women. You know, sometimes
          in life all you have are fucked up,
          poisonous choices.

Rosalyn reaches over, grabs Sydney's face and kisses her.
                                                               100.


      Rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out.
      THE BEE GEES "HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART?" STARTS.

      Sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her
      lips as Rosalyn storms out of the powder room.

                                                      SMASH TO:


129   ROSALYN WALKS OUT SHAKY -- SUDDENLY FROM BEHIND A ROW OF      129
      WOODEN PAYPHONES A HAND GRABS ROSALYN'S AND PULLS HER BEHIND
      THEM - ITS PETE MUSANE - THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER - SILENT -
      INTENSE-- ROSALYN IS SHAKING AND CRYING AS SHE FALLS APART IN
      HIS ARMS.

      SYDNEY COMES STORMING OUT OF THE POWDER ROOM AND WALKS RIGHT
      PAST ROSALYN AND PETE.

      PUSH IN ON: SYDNEY LOOKING BACK, STOPPED, SEES ROSALYN
      EMBRACING PETE AS SHE CRIES.

                                                      SMASH TO:


130   SYDNEY RUNS INTO BACK ROOM, URGENTLY JOINS IRV AND RICHIE AT    130
      THE TABLE.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                We need to talk! This is serious.

                                                      SMASH TO:


      CARMINE AND DOLLY CLIMB THE STAIRS TO THE MAIN BALLROOM
      FILLED EXCITEDLY WITH OPTIMISM AS THE SONG SWELLS. THEY KISS
      IN SILHOUETTE INTO A HARD BACKLIGHT. CARMINE CLIMBS REACHES
      THE STAGE AND THE CROWD ROARS.

                          AL KALOWSKI
                Ladies and gentlemen, your friend,
                the working man's friend, my
                friend, Mayor Carmine Polito!


      ON STAGE: Carmine TAKES MIC

      Irving stands off to the side of the stage as his world
      closes in around him. Pulls his heart pills out of his pocket
      and takes one. Sydney sees this as she stands nearby with
      Richie.

      Irv, Edith, Richie watch near stage, jostled. Rosalyn enters
      the ball room looking disheveled as she is guided by Pete
      Musane looks to stage.
                                                              101.


                           CARMINE POLITO
                    (on mic)
                Hello, Camden! Hello, New Jersey!
                Hello, Atlantic City! [CROWD ROARS]
                A lot of my friends been out of
                work [CROWD WHISTLES - BOOS] A lot
                of good hard working families just
                wanna WORK AND LIVE. (crowd CHEERS)
                There's no money nowhere. You gotta
                be kidding me! -- don't they
                remember who built this country?
                [CHEERS] The one thing we can all
                agree about in the State of New
                Jersey is that we never, ever give
                up! Do we?

      Carmine dominates the crowd and you can see the emotion in
      his face as he says this. He raises his glass to the crowd.

                           CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
                Please, raise a glass with me to a
                new era that begins tonight. From
                me and my family, we thank you. For
                all the hard work that you've given
                us in the community. Look what
                you've done. This is beautiful!
                Thank you!

      Crowd ROARS WILDLY. Irv watches, MOVED AND DESTROYED.

      DISSOLVE TO: SHOTS OF EMPTY BALL ROOM, TRASHED HALLWAYS,
      ATLANTIC CITY STREET TO OCEAN -- OCEAN SOUNDS

                                                      SMASH TO:


132   INT. IRVING'S DRY CLEANERS - EARLY MORNING                     132

      Irving walks in with his keys, same clothes from night
      before, as ocean sounds continue, TAKES A GUN FROM THE SAFE,
      and he stands looking lost and lonely, he turns on the
      electric dry cleaning rack, where he and SYDNEY STOOD
      TOGETHER, IN LOVE. He looks heartsick. HE STEPS INSIDE THE
      SWIRLING ELECTRIC DRY CLEANING RACK OF PLASTIC WRAPPED
      CLOTHES, AND STANDS ALONE, WHERE SYD USED TO BE, AND IS
      HEARTBROKEN.


      EXT. THIRD AVENUE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      RICHIE STORMS DOWN THE STREET IN SAME NIGHT CLOTHES.

134   INT. HALLWAY TO SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                      134

      BANG BANG BANG -- Richie POUNDS ON SYDNEY'S DOOR -- SYDNEY,
      HAIR IN CURLERS, ANSWERS THE DOOR.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Can I use your phone?

135   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT DAY - AS SHE WATCHES -- HE paces      135
      intense, phone in hand, SHIRT SLEEVES, a mess. HE DIALS.

                          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
                    (to Sydney)
                Last night was insane. I got it all
                figured out.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                Stoddard Thorsen.

                Listen, I need the Sherman Suite at

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                    (on phone)
                That's a whole floor of the hotel.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I need a whole floor. I need it for
                my operation

                           STODDARD THORSEN
                (on phone)
                Stop calling it your operation,
                Richard. It's not your operation.
                And I'm not giving you a whole
                floor of the Plaza Hotel.


      INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                I have members of Congress that are
                gonna come in right now to try to
                give the Sheik citizenship. They're
                taking bribes. This is happening
                right now. That's what's happening
                right now.
                                                       103.


INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

                     STODDARD THORSEN
          (on phone)
          Bribing members of Congress are you
          out of your fucking mind?


INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Stoddard. Stoddard! Shut up!
          Listen! Do you know who Victor
          Tellegio is? Victor. Tellegio.
          Works for Meyer Lansky. You know
          who that is?

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          I know who Victor Tellegio is.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Resorts International! He wants ten
          million dollars. I have two weeks!

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          You're not getting ten million
          dollars.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (screaming)
          Just listen to me! You're not
          listening to me! I have two weeks!
          I have two weeks to put this thing
          together and I need you to get me
          the Sherman Suite at the Plaza
          Hotel. And your going to fucking do
          it!

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          Lower your voice. You don't get to
          yell at me.

Richie SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE. Edith (HAIR IN CURLERS) STARES
AT HIM.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Calm me down baby. You gotta calm
          me down.

He handles her hips and neck and waist and ass.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          Baby let's do this. Let's do this
          right now. --
                                                       104.


                    EDITH GREENSLY
          No, no.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I want to do this. You're fucking
          skin is glowing baby. Your skin is
          glowing.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          I'm not doing this with you. We're
          not going to do this unless we do
          it for real, alright?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I want to do this now!

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          That's what we agreed on so we're
          not going to do that alright?
          Alright? Where are you? You're
          acting all scary.

She grabs him by the head to calm him down.

                    EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)
          Are you here with me?

HE TRIES A GENTLER SEDUCTION.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (leans down to her eyes)
          I love you. I love you. Look at me.
              (slowly)
          I'm in love with you. It is real
          now. I just said it so now's the
          time.

He handles her, nuzzles her neck, starts to turn her on.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
              (kissing him)
          You want the truth? You want real?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I'm ready for real.

SOMETHING CLICKS INSIDE HER -- SHE DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
              (DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT)
          OK, this is real. Do you hear my
          voice? This is real. This is real.
          What you hear is real.
                                                       105.


Richie steps back quickly and grabs Sydney.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          This is me.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What do you mean? What are you
          doing an accent? An American
          accent?

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          No. There is no English. There's
          only American. There is no English.

Richie looks at her and continues to hold her looking very
confused and flustered.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What are you talking about? Stop
          it. You're Edith. You're Edith
          Greensly. I checked your records.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I falsified my records back to
          birth. I falsified them.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
          My name is Sydney Prosser, and I'm
          from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm
          not Edith Greensly. There is no
          Edith Greensly.

Richie steps back. He stares at her darkly.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You're -- freaking -- me -- out.
          No, you said in the stall that we
          were going to be real and that we
          weren't going to fake it.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I'm being real now. This is who I
          am. I'm Sydney Prosser. Ok?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          So -- why -- did you do an English
          accent after that?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I'm sorry I didn't tell you in the
          stall.
                    (MORE)
                                                       106.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
          I created Edith because I needed
          her to survive, okay? But I'm done
          with that now. I'm so fucking done
          with that. Like you do what you
          need to survive, right? You do it.
          You know, you live with your mom --
          you have a fiancée you don't even
          acknowledge, right? That's what
          you do. And you curl your hair in
          little fucking curlers, which is --
          No, it's okay, you look good with
          it, but you know -- you have
          straight hair, so that's what you
          do to survive. You do all sorts of
          things, you know. We all do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (whispers tensely)
          Please don't talk about that. I'm
          confused. I'm confused and --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I'm fucking confused too, alright?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          -- I think we should fuck, and then
          we'll feel it and we won't be
          confused anymore.

HE EMBRACES HER --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          No -- I want to talk. I don't want
          to fuck.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (embracing her)
          Yes! Come on.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          NO! I'm not fucking you. I'm not
          fucking fucking you!

RED FACED LIKE HE MAY HIT HER, a vein stands out in his neck.
SHE FLINCHES. HE SCREAMS like an animal in confusion and
frustration.

                     RICHIE DIMASO
          AHHH!

SUDDENLY SYDNEY GRABS A GLASS PICTURE FRAME FROM A TABLE,
SMASHES IT ACROSS RICHIE'S FOREHEAD AND FACE WITH A
SHATTERING OF GLASS.
                                                       107.


Richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
              (in pain and dismay)
          SHIT!

They hear a door open off screen, someone approaches. Irving
appears from around the corner of the wall pointing his
handgun at Richie.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Will you please step away from
          Edith. I'm asking you nicely please
          step away from Edith right now.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What the fuck --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Step away from her. Please.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You mean Sydney?

Irving looks over to Sydney very confused.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I told him. I'm sorry. I just don't
          give a fuck anymore, I don't give a
          fuck. I don't fucking care.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Irving has a gun.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          What Richie's gotten us into is
          worse then jail. I told you last
          night, don't sit down with those
          goons. And what? Now what? No one's
          getting ten million for Tellegio.
          It's over.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I don't think so.

Irving and Sydney stare.


                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
              (slowly)
          Because when Tellegio finds out
          what happened, do you think he's
          gonna go after me? I don't think
          so. Someone from the Bureau?
                    (MORE)
                                                       108.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          Think he's gonna go after a
          politician? He's gonna kill you.
          Then he's going to go after your
          son. And Sydney.

Richie PICKS UP PHONE AS THEY WATCH -- HE DIALS. INTERCUT:

                    STODDARD THORSEN
              (on phone)
          Stoddard Thorsen.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (slowly, intensely)
          You're going to give me the Sherman
          Suite. The whole floor.

HIS NOSE AND FOREHEAD ARE CUT FROM THE GLASS.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          That's a NO. I said no wacko.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          And you're going to tell me the
          point of that FUCKING fishing
          story.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          Not the way you're behaving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (FUMING)
          What's the matter with you? Where
          are you right now?

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          What does that make a difference?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Just tell me where the fuck you
          are.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          The field office on 61st street.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I'm coming to 61st Street. Right
          now.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          You're going to do what?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          To beat -- your ass.
                                                               109.


                          STODDARD THORSEN
                You're going to what?

      Richie SLAMS the phone down, storms out the apartment.


140   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   140

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                You were right. We should have gone
                away.

      Irving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess.
      Sydney sits on the bed drinking a Fresca.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
                I should have gone away with you.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
                We were supposed to do it from the
                feet up like you always said.
                That's how we were meant to do it
                but you didn't do it like that. You
                didn't do it like that. You played
                it safe so there was always a
                danger you were going to end up
                with Rosalyn in the dead space,
                floating on some dead spaceship
                with the furniture and the
                curtains. And I was your life line
                out and you were mine and that was
                ok.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                    (Irving stares at her,
                     emotional)
                I wish I could get you back.

      He walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to
      Sydney.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
                You know I can't do it without you.
                You know that. Come on. Me, you
                and Danny. Like we said.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
                Like I said. You never said that. I
                said that. We gotta get over on all
                these guys. That's what we need to
                be thinking about right now.

      Irving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.
                                                               110.


                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                That's big. That's crazy. Whatever
                it is, it's got to be the best
                we've ever done.

      Sydney nods her head yes, stares intensely at Irving as the
      camera tilts down to reveal: their hands clasped together.


141   EXT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN - DAY                        141

      High ceiling, old office. Close on a tape recorder.

      AS CAMERA PULLS BACK - SEE   STODDARD, BANDAGES ON HIS BRUISED
      FACE AND A WHITE EYE PATCH   ON HIS INJURED EYE, SITTING
      OPPOSITE PROSECUTOR, AMADO   - - the tape recorder and
      microphone sit on the desk   in front of Stoddard as he records
      a statement for a report.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                    (SLOW MIDWEST MONOTONE)
                Agent Dimaso called me late at
                night on the 21st. I believe that
                he was intoxicated. He threatened
                me and I told him this was
                inappropriate. I told him
                procedures exist for reasons we
                must respect. This is the third
                such call I received from Agent
                Dimaso. He called me again the
                night of the 5th and he threatened
                to kill me. Subsequently he
                demanded that I allow him to use
                the Sherman Suite at the Plaza
                hotel for purposes of bribing
                members of congress.

      Camera pull-back reveals: THE CHASTENED Richie SITS
      LISTENING, IN A SUIT AND TIE. He's in trouble with their
      boss, the prosecutor.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I am so sorry.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                I'm not finished. There's a lot
                more.

      Richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard.
      Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit
      again.
                                                             111.


                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I have nothing but the utmost
                respect for you as my mentor. (he
                reaches down and turns the tape
                recorder off) and as my --

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                    (re: the recorder)
                What are you doing?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I just want to talk from my heart.
                I don't want it on record. I want
                to get vulnerable.

                           STODDARD THORSEN
                Can I finish? Can I finish my
                statement?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Of course. I respect you.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                I think you do other things besides
                respect me.

                                                      SMASH TO:


139   INT. STODDARD'S FIELD OFFICE - FLASHBACK                       139

      Stoddard paces while on the phone, holds up a finger to
      Richie to wait, Richie picks up Stoddard's phone -- rips the
      cord out and smashes Stoddard across the face with the base.
      Doesn't stop til Stoddard falls to the ground, knocks over
      desk chair and bookcase behind.

                                                       BACK TO:


      INT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWN TOWN

      They stare at each other.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                It's just hard for me to control my
                passion. I'm a very passionate
                person. (looks to Amado) You're
                from New York. You understand this.
                He goes ice fishing in the midwest.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                That was told to you in confidence.
                                                         112.


                    RICHIE DIMASO
          He's an ice fishing guy. Look at
          him.

                                              SMASH BACK TO:


INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Where we left off. Stoddard reaches with bloodied hands
across -- what is he reaching for? Oh, on a small table, a
gun and a clip.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What are you doing pulling out your
          gun? Stop it. That's not you.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          No, it's me. This is me. It's me.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Don't do something that you don't
          know anything about. Alright?

Richie grabs his gun and starts to load it.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          DO NOT LOAD THAT GUN. YOU DROP THAT
          GUN.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I'll show you how it's done. I'm
          not even going to hit you.

He points the gun at Stoddard.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          Watch this fucko.

                                                     CUT TO:


INT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN

Richie and Stoddard stare at each other in silence.

                    ANTHONY AMADO
          So, you want to use the Sherman
          Suite? The entire floor?

Stoddard throws his head back, looks at ceiling in
exasperation.
                                       113.


          STODDARD THORSEN
OH GOD.

          RICHIE DIMASO
Yes! At the Plaza Hotel.

          ANTHONY AMADO
What happened to the Mafia? I
thought you were --

          RICHIE DIMASO
This is where they intersect! This
is where the two things intersect.
The Politicians and the Mafia.
Victor Tellegio's people who run
resorts international --

          ANTHONY AMADO
Victor Tellegio showed his face?

          RICHIE DIMASO
Yes. I sat with him. I sat with
Victor Tellegio. I hung out with
him. We can get him. We can get his
whole organization as well as
getting any number of congressmen.
I mean, that's just peeling the
first layer of the onion.

          ANTHONY AMADO
Wow. How you going to do that?

          RICHIE DIMASO
We would get ten million dollars
and put it into an account --

          STODDARD THORSEN
TEN MILLION DOLLARS?! Ten Million
dollars?

          RICHIE DIMASO
And that's how we just let them
know we're for real.

          ANTHONY AMADO
What does he say he's gonna do for
the ten million dollars? How are we
trapping him?

          RICHIE DIMASO
He promises to build casinos,
handle the skims, do the licencing -
-
                                                                114.


                          STODDARD THORSEN
                And you have him on tape saying
                this. You have that right? No.

                          ANTHONY AMADO
                    (to Richie)
                I want you to find a safer way to
                get Victor Tellegio on a wire. No
                ten million dollars -- that's
                crazy.

                             STODDARD THORSEN
                Thank you.

      Richie looks down, defeated.

                          ANTHONY AMADO
                Even to entrap Tellegio it's crazy.
                But you can have the Sherman Suite -
                -

                             STODDARD THORSEN
                NO.

                          ANTHONY AMADO
                --Stoddard, please -- To go and get
                me some congressmen. Go get some
                congressmen taking bribes. I want
                to pinch us some congressmen, ok?
                You come back to me. I'm proud of
                you.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                Thank you.
                (then as an afterthought)
                And Stoddard.


143   INT. CORRIDOR - OLD FEDERAL COURT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS          143

      Richie and Stoddard walk down large, echoey Federal building
      corridor. Stoddard walking ten feet ahead turns and points at
      Richie.

                           STODDARD THORSEN
                    (shouts bitterly)
                Good luck keeping your job, by the
                way, and staying out of jail -- and
                not being killed by the Mob. But
                other than that you're doing a
                great job.

      Stoddard turns and storms off.
                                                                115.


                          RICHIE DIMASO
                    (as Stoddard walks away)
                What's the end of the ice fishing
                story?

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                I'm not telling you the end of the
                ice fishing story.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I'm going to call your fucking
                brother and find out from him.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                My brother's dead.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                That's how it ends. He fell through
                the fucking ice.

                          STODDARD THORSEN
                    (shouts bitterly)
                No it's not. He died a different
                way, many years later.

      He storms off and leaves Richie staring in the hallway.


      EXT. PLAZA HOTEL -- DAY

      Establishing.


145   INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GENERAL SHERMAN SUITE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 145

      Richie walks out of a surveillance room and down the hallway
      to where Irv and Sydney wait.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Listen I know it's awkward and I
                just want to say I'm sorry,
                alright? I think we can stick
                together and still fulfill our
                goal. I mean, we got the Sherman
                Suite.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                You got the whole floor?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                We got the whole floor, yeah.

                          EDITH GREENSLY
                That's good.
                                                          116.


                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Yeah, you ok?

                       SYDNEY PROSSER
          Yeah. You?

Richie gestures to his eye that Sydney smashed with the
picture frame. He's got a few little scabs.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          It's alright. I got hit a little
          bit. My eye. It's a little blurry
          but I got drops at the pharmacy.

Richie looks over to Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          Hey, you OK?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yeah, I'm good --

Richie looks back over to Sydney

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Listen, I'm sorry.

                       SYDNEY PROSSER
          I'm sorry.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (to Irving)
          I'm sorry Irving.

Irving doesn't know what to say, starts to say something
twice, stops, can't think of what to say. Leaves Richie
hanging.


INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GENERAL SHERMAN SUITE - DAY

Richie directs where cameras should be concealed. AGENTS
SCHMIDT AND STOCK FOLLOW MAKING NOTES IN PADS.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You can put a camera here. And we
          get it all on film. You like it?

                       EDITH GREENSLY
          I do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (to Schmidt)
          Give me those flowers.

                             RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
                   If we put the flower base here and
                   put a camera in there we can get a
                   clear shot of the couch there where
                   we can put the congressmen.

      Irving, sitting on the couch, looks kind of disturbed by
      this.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD
                   That's right. That's the idea.

                   And Carmine will go to jail after
                   he delivers us the congressmen soon
                   to be felons.

      Carmine's aid MELORA answers a ringing phone as Carmine sits
      at his desk.

                             MELORA
                   Congressman O'Connell is on the
                   phone --

                   I got to take this you guys
                   everyone out please.

      Dolly Polito, checking the unwatered plants in her husbands
      office with her coat on, she has just stopped by. Turns and
      holds up a parched and dying houseplant.

                             DOLLY POLITO
                   This is sad. It's just sad.

                             CARMINE POLITO
                   Dolly please, I gotta take this.

                             DOLLY POLITO

                   Congressman, how you doing? It's
                   Carmine. Tell me you're gonna be in
                   Trenton this week. We have an
                   amazing investment opportunity I'd
                   like to discuss with you.

                I'm federal agent Richard Dimaso.
                I've placed seventy-five thousand
                dollars into this briefcase for
                Representative John O'Connell of

148   EXT. STATE CAPITOL - TRENTON, NEW JERSEY - DAY                  148

      Carmine shakes hands with REP. JOHN O'CONNELL --

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Congressman, thank you for coming
                by, John --

                          RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)
                Representative O'Connell was
                contacted by Carmine Polito to ask
                if he could obtain rapid
                citizenship through an act of
                Congress for one Sheik Abdullah,
                investor.

      They walk up the capitol steps.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                You wanna talk jobs, investment,
                construction, if we can expedite a
                very wealthy man's citizenship --

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                How you doing congressmen?

                          JOHN O'CONNELL
                I'm excited to be here.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                This brings the state back. I mean,
                how long we known each other?
                          (MORE)
                                                   119.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
          You know what this is gonna do for
          us? This is huge for the state of
          New Jersey. It stabilizes our
          economy.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Hotels. Restaurants. It's waiting
          to happen. Carmine sees it, this
          fucking thing is waiting to happen.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          The goddamn bankers. Keeping their
          money on the sidelines. How we
          supposed to get anything done?

                    JOHN O'CONNELL
          Bankers only put money in the game
          when they can reap insane profit.

Richie staring, mesmerized by this trap.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          The only problem is this
          citizenship situation. I mean, we
          got to expedite it as soon as
          possible.

                    JOHN O'CONNELL
          Yeah, well I'll tell you, you came
          to the right place.

Everyone looks tense and on edge before.

                    JOHN O'CONNELL (CONT'D)
          I'll make it happen.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Hey, this is going to happen.

Richie slides the briefcase in John's direction.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
          This is real. You understand? This
          is real. On my family. On my kids.
          On my life. On my work.

                    JOHN O'CONNELL
          I know that, Carmine. You're a
          good man

This hurts Irving to see his friends sincerity.
                                                             120.

                I don't want to do anything illegal-

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Please Gerry. Use it as a campaign
                donation. Whatever you want to do.

      Richie slides the briefcase to him.


155   ANOTHER DAY                                                    155

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                    (on grainy monitor)
                I'm placing g $60,000 into an this
                brief case for one Congressman Eric
                Keshoygan of the 4th district --

                I'm going to do what I can to help
                Carmine.

      Irv watches in pain as he sits with them.

                                                       SMASH TO:

                two term United States Senator
                Horton Mitchell of New Jersey.

      A distinguished silver haired Senator, older.

                Atlantic City. All the way down the
                shore. A mecca by the sea.

      Richie slides over the briefcase.

                          HORTON MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                Carmine you're beloved by your
                people. Your constituency is not
                even your constituency it's your
                family. That's what you represent,
                family.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                One small thing we do for this man
                is a huge thing we do for the
                people of New Jersey. This is what
                we can leave behind.

      Irving can't stand how hopeful his friend Carmine is being
      because Irving knows Carmine is being set up. He gets up --

                          CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
                Irving what are you doing?

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Where you going?

                           IRVING ROSENFELD
                     (excusing himself
                      uncomfortably)
                I just gotta go see a man about a
                dog.

158   IRVING WALKS DOWN THE HALL VERY DISTORTED. HE GOES INTO THE     158
      VIDEO ROOM WHERE STODDARD WATCHES THE SURVEILLANCE MONITORS
      INTENSELY AS CARMINE CONTINUES TO STAND BEHIND HIS SINCERE
      PLEDGES.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                    (on grainy monitor)
                I appreciate this. On my family. On
                my kids. This needs to happen. It's
                gotta happen. You've got my word

      Irving walks out of the room --

                I want to save us. I want to save
                Carmine. It's fucking killing me.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
                You know the only way to help
                Carmine is through the Tellegio
                thing.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                It's dangerous. We gotta get a wire
                in there. We gotta make him feel
                safe.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
                There's only one thing that can
                really fuck this up and that's your
                wife.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD
                       (pacing)

      Rosalyn fixes Danny's coat, hands him his lunch and sends him
      off towards the school's front door --

      CLOSE UP: ROSALYN STARES INTO LENS. Emotional, a mixture of
      sadness and hope. She holds a closed bottle of her favorite
      nail finish and smells it nostalgically.

      A BLACK SEDAN PULLS INTO THE FRAME, SHE OPENS THE DOOR AND
      GETS IN. IT IS PETE MUSANE, TELLEGIO'S MOBSTER SHE FLIRTED
      WITH AT THE CASINO.

      moment before pushing it away. They stare at each other.

      A NICE RESTAURANT OVERLOOKING THE LONG ISLAND SOUND, LIGHT
      CORAL COLORED TABLECLOTHS; THE PLACE FILLED WITH DAYLIGHT --
      ROSALYN AND PETE SIT VERY CLOSE. QUIET. TOGETHER. IN SILENCE.
      FEW BEATS. CONTENT.
                                                123.


                    PETE MUSANE
          I don't like your husband. You're
          no good together. He doesn't
          appreciate you. Hey, it happens.
          It happened in my marriage. That's
          why I went to Miami. Sometimes you
          just gotta be tough. You gotta
          stand up and you gotta leave, you
          know?

Rosalyn looks at Pete smitten.

                    PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)
          Sometimes you gotta let something
          die to let something live. You're
          too beautiful to be unhappy.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I know. I mean, I don't want to
          badmouth my husband, but let me
          badmouth my husband for a second.
          He just thinks that he knows
          everything and he's so full of
          shit. He's such a liar. He thinks
          that I'm stupid, but I'm not
          stupid. I hear him on the phone
          arguing. He loves Carmine, but he
          hates that other guy, that curly-
          headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever
          who's carting around my husband's
          ex-lover, that redheaded whore.

                    PETE MUSANE
          IRS?

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Anyway. You can see that it drives
          him crazy.

                    PETE MUSANE
          You said IRS. What IRS guy? What
          are you talking bout?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I hear them on the phone. I think
          that he's got Irv in some sort of
          bind or something and he's making
          him do all of this stuff and so Irv
          and Carmine right now are at the
          Plaza Hotel throwing away all this
          money at like Congress or whatever.
          They're giving money to congress or
          something. I don't really know but
          I overheard it on the phone.
                                                             124.


      Pete's brow furrows - this is serious.

                          PETE MUSANE
                You know I hate to do this to you
                but I have to go talk to your
                husband. My boss is already angry.
                You stay here I'm going to give you
                some money for a taxi home.

      He puts cash in her hands.

                          PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)
                You stay here. Get yourself some
                dessert. Finish the bottle of
                prosecco. I'm sorry.

      Rosalyn and Pete hold hands as Rosalyn stares into his eyes.
      Very emotional.

                          PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)
                You alright?

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                    (open, vulnerable)
                I don't like change. It's really
                hard for me. Sometimes I think that
                I'll die before I change.

      He kisses her.

                          PETE MUSANE
                It's gonna be okay. You're gonna
                come live with me in Miami.

      Pete gets up and walks. As he does:

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
164             Don't hurt him too bad. He's still                    164
                Danny's father.

                                                       BACK TO:

      CHANGING.


166   EXT. PLAZA HOTEL -- DAY                                         166

      Irv and Carmine down sidewalk leaving from The Plaza Hotel --

      Pete Musane stands next to an open passenger side door, --
      Irv and Carmine do not move, they stare at the open door.
                                                             125.


      PAUL MCCARTNEY AND WINGS "LIVE AND LET DIE" STARTS OMINOUSLY.


      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

170   Rosalyn in full muumuu, wearing cleaning gloves and holding a 170
      vacuum sings to LIVE AND LET DIE while Danny sits on the
      couch watching her. Very intense.


171   INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - "LIVE AND LET DIE" CONTINUOUS     171

      Irving and Carmine sit up front with Pete driving and Dick
      Helsing sits in the back seat looking angry.


      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - "LIVE AND LET
      DIE" CONTINUOUS

      Rosalyn continues to sing and gets more intense as the music
      picks up.


      INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - "LIVE AND LET DIE" CONTINUOUS

      Irving looks over to Pete nervously. Unsure of what's going
      to happen.


      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - "LIVE AND LET
      DIE" CONTINUOUS

      Rosalyn whips her head up and down, dancing manically through
      the house.


      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Rosalyn sits on the bed with Danny with clothes all over the
      place while smoking a cigarette.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                Life is ridiculous and I would
                never say anything bad about your
                father in front of you but your
                father is a sick son of a bitch.

                          DANNY
                Daddy's a sick son of a bitch?

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                Don't repeat that. But yes.
                                                        126.


EXT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Irving's Caddy comes screeching up to the house and parks in
the driveway. Irv get's out and races inside.


INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rosalyn is still sitting on the bed with Danny.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (O.S.)
              (shouts)
          ROSALYN! ROSALYN!

Rosalyn looks scared.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          This is a real low in our
          relationship! You know where I was
          recently? I was in your boyfriend's
          fucking car! I saw your nail
          polish.

                                                  SMASH TO:


INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - FLASHBACK

IRVING LOOKS DOWN AND SEES THE BOTTLE OF ROSALYN'S NAIL
FINISH ON THE CAR SEAT -- HE PICKS IT UP, LOOKS AHEAD THROUGH
WINDSHIELD SMELLS IT, WORRIED. Carmine glances over his
shoulder anxiously at Dick Helsing in the back seat.

                    PETE MUSANE
          What's this I hear about your curly
          haired friend working for the
          Government?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          What?! Who said that?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's bullshit!

                       PETE MUSANE
          Your wife.

Irving is surprised to hear this.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's bullshit.

                       CARMINE POLITO
          Rosalyn?

                                                SMASH TO:


INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - FLASHBACK

A WHITE CANVAS BAG GARROTES OVER IRVING'S HEAD, FROM HELSING
IN THE BACK SEAT.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Hey, what the fuck?! --

                    PETE MUSANE
          Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

DICK HOLDS A GUN TO THE BACK OF IRVING'S BAGGED HEAD.


INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? BECAUSE HE IS
          TRYING TO KILL ME!

                    ROSALYN
          What are you talking about?!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU
          THINK YOU'RE DOING?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Get out of here! I'm not doing
          anything!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO MUCH? YOU'RE
          GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED!

Irving looks down to see Danny sitting there on the bed.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Danny. Come here buddy alright? Go
          draw a picture or something.

Irving ushers Danny out of the room.
                                                       128.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You're a real sick son of a bitch
          for screaming at me like that in
          front of Danny.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'M A SICK SON OF A BITCH? YOU'RE
          TRYING TO GET ME FUCKING KILLED. OH
          MY GOD!! YOU DRIVE ME SO FUCKING
          CRAZY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU'RE
          BOYFRIEND -- YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND
          WILL KILL ME, HE'LL KILL DANNY, AND
          HE'LL KILL YOU.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          STOP TALKING LIKE THAT!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          He's a mobster alright? That's who
          you're dealing with.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Alright fine! Yes, I wanted to hurt
          you but how do you think that I
          feel all day when you leave me
          alone all day? And all I've ever
          wanted is for you to love me.
          That's all I ever wanted. And stay
          married and for you to love me. And
          that's why I'm going to Miami!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You're NOT going to Miami.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          That's why I'm going to Miami with
          Pete!

Irving picks up Rosalyn's clothes from the bed where there is
an open suitcase, throws them back in the closet.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You are NOT going to Miami.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I finally found somebody who loves
          me just like YOU always wanted.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Too dangerous. Miami? Not now. Too
          dangerous.

Irv continue to throw clothes back into the closet.
                                                       129.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          He likes me just the way I am.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Not now. Everything has to stay
          normal right now. And you're going
          to shut your mouth!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You told me that you wanted me to
          find a nice quiet man!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Oh and what a DOOZY you picked!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          He's the one.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          He's the most dangerous guy ever.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IRVING?! I
          KNOW EVERYBODY THROUGH YOU! WHY
          CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME?!

Irving reaches for his heart pills but they fall out of his
hands and scatter on the floor. He bends down to grab them
and almost falls. Rosalyn helps him up.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Why aren't you taking your heart
          pills? Irving, what's going on?
          What kind of trouble are you in?!
          What's happening?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (out of breath)
          I've got a plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          What's happening?

Irving coughs and steps back. Out of breath and very winded.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I've got a plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You've got a plan? When did you get
          it?
                                                             130.


                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                It really fucking came to me when I
                was inside of that canvas bag with
                your boyfriend's hands around my
                throat. That's when it really came
                to me.

                Take it off! Take the bag off his
                head!

      Dick pulls the bag off Irving's head, his comb over is all
      messed up. IRVING GASPS. Pete and Dick LAUGH --

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                We've got two million coming this
                week!

                           PETE MUSANE
                What do you think this is? You
                think this is a fucking down
                payment plan? Like were Sears of
                Chevrolet?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                You ask Victor if he wants two
                million this week. That's real
                money. Two million.

                          PETE MUSANE
                Two million? How?

                            IRVING ROSENFELD

      They LAUGH, Irving's hair is all messed up.

      Pete patches out. Irving and Carmine are a mess, shirts
      ripped open, no buttons, they look at each other VERY SHAKEN.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Is it true? Is it true what he
                said about your wife?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                It's not fucking true. That's not
                true.

INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can save all of us, and we can
          save money. I can take care of you
          and Danny. OK? But you gotta close
          your mouth.

Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I knew it. I have always said,
          Irving, that you are very, very
          hard to motivate properly. And I
          knew that Pete was gonna go over
          there and knock some sense into
          you. I've been reading this book,
          Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about
          the power of intention.

Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now.

Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a
book.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          And my intention in sending Pete
          over to you was so that you could
          come up with this plan. So, you're
          welcome.

Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces
himself to say gently --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you
          for the plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You're welcome.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I appreciate that. So, I think that
          we should be partners on this.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm a good partner. Almost better
          than Edith. You ever think about
          that? You ever think about how you
          might have underestimated me?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          So what is our plan? Tell me the
          plan. What are you gonna do?
                                                         132.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm going to keep my mouth shut and
          I'm not going to say anything but
          what do I do if Pete calls me? What
          am I supposed to say?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You gotta stop talking about your
          government agencies and your I.R.S.
          and your tax and your conspiracies
          and all of that. You're gonna say
          how you were wrong, you were wrong
          about that.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but
          you know that in real life, I was
          right for saying all that stuff
          because then that spurred on the
          actions that made you come up with
          this plan. So I will tell Pete.

                      IRVING ROSENFELD
                (holding his head)
          OK.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (pointing with cigarette
               between fingers)
          The power of intention Irving. The
          power of intention.

Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          OK. You were right.

Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          You're so smart. Good job, peaches.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Irving, I've been doing a lot of
          thinking and -- you need to grow
          up. And you need to face the
          facts. And I think that both of us
          will be a lot happier if we get a
          divorce.

As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months,
now spoken as Rosalyn's idea.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
                 OK.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                 Just think about it. (kisses him)
                 These things are never easy.

       Irving starts walking away towards the door.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
                 Alright.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                 Irving. Good luck with your plan.


       EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY

       The spare rhythmic intro of Jeff Lynne's "Long Black Road"
       plays as Richie looks back over his shoulder and walks
       towards the building with intensity.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 Necessity truly is the mother of
                 invention. The F.B.I. was willing
                 to wire the two million dollars if
                 it meant taking down Tellegio and
                 his entire organization.

       Irving walks with Richie and Sydney up to an office building.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 A mobster like Tellegio would never
                 meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only
                 at the office of his attorney,
                 Alfonse Simone.

       They walk into mob lawyer Simone's building.

       They open door to large, spare reception area of Alfonse
       Simone's law office. MIDDLE AGED SECRETARY looks up and picks
       up the phone.


178E   INT. HALLWAY OF ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS            178E

       NEARBY AT A SMALL TABLE SYDNEY IS FRISKED BY A BLACK MAN IN A
       SUIT, SHE SUSTAINS EYE CONTACT WITH IRVING AND RICHIE AS THEY
       ARE ALSO FRISKED BY ANOTHER MAN IN A SUIT ACROSS THE ROOM. --
       THE CONTENTS OF SYDNEY'S PURSE ARE EMPTIED AND EXAMINED ALONG
       WITH HER PURSE. IT IS TENSE. SYDNEY STARES AT A NERVOUS
       RICHIE; THEIR MICROPHONES HAVE GONE UNDETECTED. "LONG BLACK
       ROAD" CONTINUES AS CAMERA FOLLOWS THE BACK OF THE THICK NECK
       OF THE MAN IN THE SUIT AS HE LEADS THEM DOWN A WINDING NARROW
       OFFICE CORRIDOR. IN ONE SHOT THE DOOR OPENS, JEFF LYNNE'S

178F   INT. ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                       178F

       ALFONSE SIMONE- 64, BRONX, SEASONED LAWYER.

       Alfonse Simone rises from behind his desk. A silent secretary
       sitting at his side in a white dress stares at our heros as
       Simone steps forward to introduce himself.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 Alfonse Simone.

       Edith walks up to him to shake hands. He shakes hands with
       Irving and Richie as well. Man in the suit closes the door
       behind them.

                           EDITH GREENSLY
                 Edith Greensly.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD
                 Irving Rosenfeld.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                 Good afternoon.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 Please, be seated.
                                                       135.


They sit in three chairs facing Simone's desk: Sydney/Edith,
Richie, Irving.

Simone sits behind his desk, the silent secretary sits just
behind him slightly to the side, stares at Edith, Richie,
Irving.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE (CONT'D)
          I appreciate the fact that you all
          came in person, but the trip was
          really unnecessary because this
          whole thing could have been done
          with a simple wire transfer. As a
          matter of fact this is the number
          of our wire right here.

Simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to
them. Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Where is Mr. Tellegio?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was
          called out of town on business.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's not good. We were willing to
          come here today, in person, to see
          Mr. Tellegio, as a sign of respect
          to give two million dollars --

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          I can assure you that I have the
          power of attorney --

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Excuse me. If you'll let me finish,
          we are willing to give two million
          dollars today of the ten. But
          without Mr. Tellegio here --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (to Simone)
          We can't, we can't make that
          decision. It's not the right thing.
          It's not the right time. It's just
          not good.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
              (to Irving across Richie)
          You don't have the authorization to
          make this kind of choice so don't
          be hasty, alright?
                                                        136.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'm not being hasty. It's just,
          let's be smart about it. This is
          not how we do business. (to Simone)
          I'm sorry. I apologize.

Richie motions with his hand to Edith that he agrees with
Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          He's right, we can't.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          I think you should hang in there.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          For what? The guy's not here.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          He isn't.

                       RICHIE DIMASO
          That's it.

He stands, goes to the door.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          This is a surprise. The Sheik
          doesn't like surprises.

Edith turns in her chair to face them in the doorway.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Don't leave.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (in doorway with Richie)
          Edith, this is not your decision to
          make.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          I understand but maybe we can call
          the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's not the plan. That's not
          the --

Edith locks eyes with Richie. Richie stares at Edith, waves
Irving off with his hand.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          No, let's -- I'll call the Sheik.
          (to Simone) Can I use your phone?
                                                       137.


                       ALFONSE SIMONE
          Please do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (to Alfonse Simone)
          I don't know if he's in, I'll call
          the Sheik. But before I do, I'd
          like to go over specifically what
          this money will be used for.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          What we will do is we guarantee all
          proper licenses and construction
          permits for any hotel casino that
          plans to open before the end of the
          year.

Richie glances down at Edith and her handbag. PUSH IN ON A
TINY MICROPHONE WE NOW SEE CLEVERLY BUILT INTO THE HANDLE OF
EDITH'S GUCCI BAG.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE (CONT'D)
          And we'll throw in the customary
          privileges and protection.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What if there are obstacles, what
          will you do?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          Obstacles? We are prepared to
          overcome any obstacles.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          This is a big enterprise.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          If we have to pay somebody off,
          we'll pay somebody off. If we have
          to lean on somebody, intimidate
          somebody, we'll intimidate
          somebody. We're experienced. This
          is our business.

RICHIE STARES AT SIMONE.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's powerful stuff. Thank you.

IRVING STARES AND SYDNEY LOOKS AT RICHIE.
                                                          138.


                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          And I'll tell you something else.
          At the end of this we'll teach you
          how to skim and how to cut it up
          and make some money on the side.
          Because we invented skimming. We've
          been doing it for thirty years.

A smile creeps across Richie's face.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Thank you. Thank you for clarifying
          that.

Richie picks up the phone to dial.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          I think that will be OK for the
          Sheik.


INT. BRENDA'S FBI WIRE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

AMADO, STODDARD, BRENDA.

                    ANTHONY AMADO
          This is the Sheik.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (on phone)
          Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's
          just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his
          lawyer. Are we still ok to wire the
          money?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          Simone can take the money. What's
          the number?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          5317AP

Amado writes it down and hands it to Brenda to call in.

                    BRENDA
          The funds have been transferred.

                    ANTHONY AMADO
          (on phone to Richie)
          The funds have been transferred.

Amado nods: victory. BACK TO:
                                                              139.


       INT. ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

       Richie hangs up.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                 The money's been wired.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 I think we have a deal.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                 Yes we do sir.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 Pleasure doing business with you.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                 Okay, well, thank you very much,
                 Mr. Simone.

       RICHIE SMILES, SYDNEY LOOKS AT IRVING, WHO LOOKS PREOCCUPIED.
       PUSH IN ON IRVING.

                           RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
                 The Sheik's very excited.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 I'm sure that we'll be seeing each
                 other.

       Richie and team start to walk out.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                     (grinning)
                 Oh I'm sure we'll be seeing each
                 other very soon. You may even get
                 sick of me, like these two.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 I don't think I'll get sick of you.
                 Nice meeting you.

       Richie, Edith, and Irving walk down the hall after leaving
       his office. Richie smiles as the opening of Bowie's "The Jean
       Genie" momentously starts. Edith smiles as she walks down the
       hall followed by Irving. Richie puts his hand on the door
       knob to exit the hallway.


178H   INT. AMADO'S OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING - DAY              178H

       THE DOOR OPENS IN A TIMECUT, RICHIE IN SUNGLASSES, HIS JACKET
       IS OFF, HE BEAMS AND CELEBRATES AND EXHORTS A ROOM FULL OF
       FBI AGENTS, ADMINISTRATORS, SECRETARIES.
                                                             140.


      THE JEAN GENIE PLAYS ENERGETICALLY AS RICHIE CELEBRATES WITH
      EVERYONE, LIKE IN A LOCKER ROOM, HIS FIST IN THE AIR.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                FINALLY! FINALLY WE GET SOME
                RESPECT!

      AMADO SITS IN HIS CHAIR WITH CIGAR IN ONE HAND AND DRINK IN
      THE OTHER. VERY EXCITED AND LAUGHING AS HE POINTS AT RICHIE.

                          ANTHONY AMADO
                    (shouts through clamor)
                We're ambitious, that's why!

      Richie suddenly moves to the reel to reel surveillance tape
      and quiets the room, the music momentarily stops as we hear
      Alfonse Simone on the surveillance tape.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                Shh, shh, shh!

                          ALFONSE SIMONE (ON SURVEILLANCE TAPE)
                If we have to pay somebody off,
                we'll pay somebody off. If we have
                to lean on somebody, intimidate
                somebody, we'll intimidate
                somebody.

      Richie joyfully lip synchs to the rhythm of Simone's
      incriminating words on tape.

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                    (in unison with Simone on
                     tape)
                -- If we have to lean on somebody,
                intimate somebody, we'll intimidate
                somebody!!

      RICHIE THROWS HIS FIST IN THE AIR AND CHEERS, JOINED BY
      EVERYONE IN THE ROOM. BOWIES "THE JENE GENIE" COMES BACK
      LOUD.

179   RICHIE TURNS AND TWIRLS A WHITE HAIRED FBI AGENT IN            179
      CELEBRATION, LAUGHING WITH JOY. THEN GOES OVER TO A SULKING
      STODDARD AND HUMPS HIM LIKE AT A FRAT PARTY, LAUGHING WITH
      EVERYBODY AT STODDARD'S STIFFNESS. STODDARD GETS UP AND
      RICHIE SMACKS HIS ASS AS HE LEAVES THE ROOM. RICHIE IMITATES
      STODDARD TO ROARING LAUGHTER -- TWICE.

      THE MUSIC CRESCENDOS TO AN ABRUPT STOP.
                                                             141.


180   EXT. CARMINE POLITO'S CAMDEN NJ CLAPBOARD HOME - DAY            180

      Irving's big blue car pulls up to the lens. Irving and Sydney
      looking a little uneasy.

      Irving stares at the house.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                I gotta do it.


181   INT. CARMINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                                181

                          CARMINE POLITO
                What do you mean, there's no sheik?
                What does that mean, "there's no
                sheik"? What does that mean?

      Carmine stares at Irving.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                I want to face you like a man
                because I want to be real now.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Who is "they"?

      Irving looks distressed. He's a wreck.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                It's the Feds.

                            CARMINE POLITO
                The Feds?

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
                Yeah.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Irving -- I'm a good person

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
                You are!

      Carmine stands up and looks around the room, disoriented, his
      life passing before his eyes.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                I've been doing this for a long
                time, for twenty years. Do you
                think I woulda taken that money if
                it wasn't the right thing to do?
                                                142.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Hey look, you're a good person I
          know that but in all honesty --

                    CARMINE POLITO
              (screams)
          You said that was the only way,
          Irv. You chased me, remember?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          They fuckin' made me do it. What
          was I supposed to do? They had Syd
          in jail.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          You made me go back to the Plaza to
          take that money, you piece of shit!
          I was gone! You fucking prick!

CARMINE BEATS IRVING DOWN ON THE COUCH.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
          I was gone, I left!

DOLLY WALKS IN.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Is everything alright? Can I have a
          word with you?

                    CARMINE POLITO
              (very upset)
          No, please, Dolly, just go
          upstairs. Take the kids and go
          upstairs!

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Alright, alright.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I want to make this right. I came
          here because I want to make it
          right.

Irving is in tears. Very upset.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Look at my face. You tell me that
          I'm lying to you when I say that
          everything I do is for the good of
          the people of New Jersey.
          Everything I do is for them. Am I
          lying to you?
                                                         143.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I never had a friend like you
          before.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          I used that money for the goddamn
          casino.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I got some leverage, alright? I can
          help you out.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          This is all shit. It's all
          bullshit.

Carmine picks up the knife the Sheik gave him.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
          Look at this thing. Look at this.
          Ceremonial fucking knife. What is
          this bullshit? Some toy?

He drops it on the table. Irving stares at his friend,
removes his glasses.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for
          you. We can help you out.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Please get out of my house, Irving.
          Will you please leave? I'm asking
          you nicely, please leave.

Irving gets up to go and is pushed towards the door by
Carmine. Dolly joins Carmine in tears. Carmine's kids stand
on the stairs.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Get out of our house!

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          I don't want to -- (seeing kids)
          I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this
          to happen.

                    CARMINE POLITO
              (to kids)
          This is not our friend!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Truly, I didn't mean for this to
          happen.
                                                             144.


      Carmine points to his family.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                This is what matters to me most and
                you're crushing it! You're going to
                take me away from them you fucking
                son of a bitch? Get the fuck out!

183   Carmine lunges at Irving and punches him in the face. Irving    183
      goes down to the ground and his glasses fly off his face.

      CARMINE kicks him one last time.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                    (beaten, bloody on floor)
                I just want to make it right.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                Get out of my house. Look what you
                made me do!

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                    (stumbling out the door)
                I'm sorry Carmine, I'm sorry.


184   EXT. CARMINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                      184

      Irving staggers out of the house in an emotional daze, one
      hand to his heart, falls to sidewalk with bloody nose and
      broken glasses --

      SYDNEY ACROSS THE STREET BURST OUT OF THE CAR.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
                Irving!

      RUNS TO HIM IN HER HIGH HEELS -- HELPS HIM SIT UP ON THE
      SIDEWALK.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
                Your heart pills. Where are your
                heart pills?

      She digs through his pockets, finds the pills, and feeds one
      to him.

      Sydney struggles to help Irving to his feet and together, an
      embattled but surviving couple, they cross the street arm and
      arm. She opens the door and helps him into the car.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                I've got to lay down.
                                                             145.


                             SYDNEY PROSSER
                Just rest.

      She gets in and closes the door.


185   INT. IRVING'S CADILLAC - DAY                                   185

      They both slump down on the seat, stare at each other,
      emotional, humbled. Sydney gently removes Irving's broken
      glasses. They stare at each other, it is quiet.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER
                    (emotional, quiet)
                Are you ready?

                             IRVING ROSENFELD
                Yes.

      They stare at each other.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
                    (whispers)
                I love you.

      She squeezes his hand, raises it to her lips and kisses it.


206   INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY                                      206

      TILT UP FROM THE FLOOR OF THE OFFICE TO RICHIE, AMADO, AND
      STODDARD INTENSELY STARING AT THE DOOR FOR A CONFRONTATION,
      LIKE IN A WESTERN. THE DOOR OPENS AS IRVING AND SYDNEY ENTER
      AND STARE BACK AT THEM.

                          ANTHONY AMADO
                Please. Come in. Sit down.

      They all sit.

                          ANTHONY AMADO (CONT'D)
                Do you know where our two million
                dollars is?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Two million? (Irving pushes his new
                glasses up the bridge of his nose)
                It's with Victor Tellegio and
                Alfonse Simone.

                          ANTHONY AMADO
                No, actually it's not with Victor
                Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.
                                                         146.


Richie stands by the window, stares angrily at Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          He fucking knows about it.

                    ANTHONY AMADO
          It's gone missing. Did you know
          that?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Where's it gone?

                    ANTHONY AMADO
          That's interesting that you said
          that because while you were on your
          way over here, we got an anonymous
          phone call from someone who said
          that in exchange for immunity for
          the two of you and a reduced
          sentence for Carmine Polito we get
          our two million dollars back.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's interesting. That's very
          interesting. I have no idea.

                     ANTHONY AMADO
          No idea?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          No idea what you're talking about.

Irving looks at Sydney who looks back at him and shakes her
head. She doesn't know either.

                    ANTHONY AMADO
          I got it. I understand how these
          deals are made. See, someone has
          leverage.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We
          got them for wire fraud, it's over.
          (to Irving and Sydney) You're done.
          You're both done.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I don't think so.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Oh, you don't think so?
                                                             147.


                           IRVING ROSENFELD
                Richard, think about it, YOU
                requested the two million. And you
                gave Brenda the account number. We
                didn't do any of that. None of it.
                (turns dramatically to face Richie)
                How do we know that YOU don't have
                the money?

                           RICHIE DIMASO
                    (Richie looks from Irving
                     to Sydney)
                Am I living in a fucking nightmare
                right now?

      AMADO AND STODDARD STARE INCRIMINATINGLY AT RICHIE.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                I find this a little offensive.
                Really, I find this a little
                offensive and I don't see that you
                got any sort of solid case against--

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                (to Amado and Stoddard)
                Don't let him get in your heads.
                Listen to me, we're dealing with a
                very clever individual.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Richard, think about it. You got
                some big arrests. You got U.S.
                Congressmen. You look good. You're
                gonna be all over the news. You
                know what doesn't look good? A
                story about gross incompetence

205                                                    SMASH TO:    205

      FLASHBACK -- RICHIE KICKS OPEN THE DOOR OF LAWYER ALFONSE
      SIMONE'S OFFICE WITH A WARRANT IN HIS HAND AND TWO AGENTS
      BEHIND HIM.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
                I have a warrant for --

      Richie looks around disoriented, we cannot see what he sees
      yet.

                          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry, do I have the wrong
                office?(checks number on the door)
                Is this 701? Alfonse Simone?
                                                        148.


                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          This is 701.

-- WE REVEAL THE VOICE BELONGS TO A BLACK ATTORNEY -- TWO
BLACK CLIENTS ACROSS FROM HIM -- SEATED AT WHAT PREVIOUSLY
APPEARED TO BE THE DESK OF LAWYER ALFONSE SIMONE.

                    BLACK DIVORCE LAWYER
          My name is Roger Thigpen. I've had
          this office for 25 years. I'm a
          divorce attorney.

RICHIE IS STUNNED.


INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          You lost two million dollars of
          taxpayer money because you were
          confused about the location and the
          identity of Victor Tellegio's
          attorney?

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. POOL PARTY - LONG ISLAND HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Where we first saw Irving at the pool party.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          The role of Tellegio's attorney,
          Alfonse Simone, was played by our
          friend Ed Malone --

Camera pans from Irving to Ed Malone:

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          the "Cold Cut King of Long Island"--

Ed Malone holds up two packages of cold cuts. Also holding
the cold cuts are the two that frisked everyone at Simone's
office.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          Whose party we were at when Sydney
          and I first met.

Cut to Irving first meeting Sydney.

                                                  CUT TO:
                                                       149.


INT. ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Ed Malone, dressed as Alfonse Simone, steps to camera to
shake Richie's hand.

                    ED MALONE
          Alfonse Simone.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. ANTHONY AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          People believe what they want to
          believe Richie.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's because you conned me! You
          both fucking conned me. You both
          got under me. You did!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Well that doesn't sound so good,
          either. I mean -- and I don't know
          what you're talking about, but --
          let's just assume you want to go
          with that story. Really? That's the
          story you want to go with? That's
          what you want the New York Times to
          hear? That you got conned by the
          very con men who you forced to
          entrap the members of Congress in
          the first place. That's what you
          want to go with? That doesn't sound
          so good for your whole thing.

Richie looks like he's going to be sick.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          And how ironic that the most
          creative minds, the ones who are
          working hardest to get the economy
          of New Jersey going, those are the
          ones that you round up. And why?
          Because what, they're the easiest
          to go after? And what about the
          real bullshit artists? You didn't
          even come close to the big leagues.
          Those big guys. The money men.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's what I was trying to go
          after.
                                                         150.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'm sorry to tell you, you got none
          of 'em.

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          You know, Richard, I think we may
          call you as a witness, but
          otherwise you're done. I think you
          better go home.

Richie disoriented, appeals to Stoddard.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Stoddard --

                    STODDARD THORSEN
          Go on home, Richard.

ELO's "10538 Overture" reprises on the soundtrack.


EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY

Camera tilts down from the Federal Building to find Richie
coming down the stairs, emotional. Richie walks wiping his
eyes, his innocence and Edith, lost.

                                                     CUT TO:

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          We took down some very big guys.

-REP. SANDERS SWARMED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS WALKING OUT OF
BUILDING, ESCORTED BY FBI AGENTS.

-REP. SIMMONS ESCORTED OUT OF CITY HALL.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          Some of whom were just doing

                And they even admitted it.

      GREY HAIRED SENATOR HORTON MITCHELL, wife by his side, denies

                But in all it was six Congressmen,

                We gave the two million back so
                Carmine got the reduced sentence.
                18 months. The loss of his

      FADE IN FROM WHITE, PAN DOWN FROM WHITE SKY TO SCHOOLYARD,
      CHILDREN LEAVING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IRVING AND SYDNEY WALK UP
      TO THE SCHOOL TO PICK UP DANNY.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                Syd and I moved in together. And
                Rosalyn --

      ROSALYN IN A NECK BRACE and off white trench coat and
      sunglasses -
                                                         152.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          The car is a little dinged up and
          I'm a little stiff but I don't want
          to talk about it.

Irving stares at Rosalyn.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          She would always be interesting.

Rosalyn gets in to a car, revealing Pete Musane in the
driver's seat. Irving leans in.

                    PETE MUSANE
              (to Irving)
          You know my boss knows you did him
          a solid.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yes I did. He never took a nickle
          so they can't get him for nothing.
          I was never going to let that
          happen.

Irving starts to leave --

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Irv.

He stops and looks at her. With red lacquered nails Rosalyn
places her favorite nail finish in his hand.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          I'm done with this nail finish. Bye
          for now. I'll see you next weekend.

Irving nods. Rosalyn drives off with Pete.

Sydney stands with Danny.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          Our conning days were behind us.

Irving and Sydney walk hand and hand with Danny down the
street. Irv drops the nail finish into a trashcan.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          You can fool yourself for just so
          long and then your next reinvention
          better have your damn feet on the
          ground.

    FADE IN:


1   EXT. DALSLAND, SWEDEN- TWILIGHT                            1

    A lake.

    A forest.

    A dacha.

    A Saab outside the dacha.

    A light within.


2   INT. DACHA- NIGHT                                          2

    JACK (dark, fit, mid-forties) is staring at the embers of a
    log fire. He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey.

    The impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the
    shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACK's quiet
    manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and
    stubble. JACK is no longer young.

    A creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder.

    INGRID (34) is naked. With an intimate familiarity she kisses
    JACK on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps
    her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across
    his upper chest.

    Her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, INGRID
    and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence.


3   EXT. WOODS- MORNING                                        3

    INGRID leads JACK through the trees. Her coat has a white fur
    collar. They are fresh-faced and warm from bed.

    They head towards a vast and frozen lake.

    JACK senses something in the woods.

    Beneath the Conifers: impenetrable darkness.

    JACK looks around.

    Thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. There is
    not the slightest breeze.

                          INGRID
                What are you looking for?

    Her Swedish accent is sing-song.
                                                           2.


                           JACK
              Nothing.

    His anxiety is evident.

    INGRID laughs out loud.

                        INGRID
              There are no wolves in the woods so
              close to the city.

    JACK smiles.


4   EXT. LAKESIDE- MORNING                                        4

    They continue through the woods until they reach the
    shoreline of the lake.

    INGRID steps onto the ice.

    Holds out her hand.

    A beat.

    JACK takes INGRID's hand.

    Solid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight.

    They walk out, INGRID slipping and laughing.

    The landscape is magical.

    JACK begins to relax, slipping and swearing.

    Suddenly, he stops.

    There are footprints in the thin snow going out across the
    lake.

                           INGRID
              Snow-hare.

    Beside the Snow-hare's prints are those of a man.

                           INGRID
              A hunter?

    JACK studies the two sets of tracks.

    Those of the Snow-hare are heading out into the lake. The
    man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards
    the shoreline.

    JACK spins around in the direction they've just come from.

    No one.
                                                        3.


Then, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a
low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the
branch.

JACK grabs INGRID, yanks her towards the cover of the
lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow.

She grunts, winded. He lies besides her.

We hear the CRACK of a bullet- so quiet it might be a bough
snapping under the weight of winter.

It isn't.

JACK pulls a WALTHER PPK/S semi-automatic handgun from the
pocket of his Parka.

Cocks it.

Waits.

Then bobs up and down once.

There's another CRACK from the trees.

JACK pinpoints the spot from the drift of BLUE SMOKE, almost
invisible in the winter air.

There's someone in the shadows.

He rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just
see over the snow and pumps THREE SHOTS into the dusk under
the trees.

We hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if
JACK has just shot a tobogganist.

More snow slides off the trees.

JACK waits.

INGRID gathers her breath but loses her wits:

                      INGRID
            You have a gun.

JACK keeps his eyes fixed on the trees.

                      INGRID
            You have a gun! How do you have a
            gun? Why should you carry such a
            weapon?

JACK looks at her briefly but makes no reply.

She is busy thinking.

So is he.
                                                         4.


                       INGRID
          Jack?

He stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that
is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees.

INGRID follows, frightened.

The MAN is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body
cushioned in white softness.

JACK kicks the sole of his boot. He's dead.

                    INGRID
          Jack talk to me!

JACK grabs his collar and turns him over.

He doesn't recognise him.

JACK fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing.

In his breast pocket he finds a MILITARY IDENTITY PASS.

                       INGRID
          Who is he?

                       JACK
          A hunter.

                    INGRID
          He's not dressed like a hunter. Why
          is he alone? Hunters always go in
          pairs. For safety.

Swiftly, JACK removes the bolt from the man's rifle and
throws it far into the trees.

                    JACK
          Go for help. Call the police.

INGRID sets off, stumbling up the track they have made
through the snow.

JACK shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck.

She twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of
her coat collar.

From a distance, INGRID looks like a shot Snow-hair.

JACK approaches her.

And steps over her, trying not to look down.

Trying not to look back.
                                                            5.


5   EXT. DACHA- MORNING                                          5

    Outside the dacha is another MAN, standing by a black
    Mercedes-Benz sedan.

    The second hunter.

    He is holding an automatic pistol but he's not on alert.

    JACK fells him easily with a bullet in the ear.

    He removes the clip from his WALTHER and reloads it.


6   INT. DACHA- MORNING                                          6

    JACK packs a few belongings in a holdall.


7   EXT. DACHA- MORNING                                          7

    JACK smashes the CB radio in the Mercedes and removes the
    distributor cap from the engine, burying it deep in the snow.

    Then he gets into the Saab.

    And drives off.


8   TITLES                                                       8

    Over images of: JACK on a ferry to Gotland; changing clothes
    and vessels for Ystad; travelling by road to Trelleborg;
    catching the night crossing to Travemunde; driving to Hamburg
    and from Hamburg catching a train to...


9   EXT. ROME- DAY                                               9

    At a fast food stand not far from the central train station,
    a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog.

    It is Autumn, and without the usual mass of Summer tourists,
    LARRY stands out as an American.

    JACK does not.

                        JACK
              Blending in?

    LARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the
    centre of attention.

                        LARRY
              Jack. What brings you to Rome?

                        JACK
              I closed the Stockholm account.
                                                           6.


     LARRY might be older than JACK but he doesn't seem it. His
     demeanour is sprightly.

                         JACK
               But there were complications.

     Then LARRY turns and walks, eating carefully. He is not a man
     who likes to get his hands dirty.

     JACK walks beside him.

     Both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings.

                         JACK
               Collateral damage. Two shooters.
               Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.

     LARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look
     at JACK.

     JACK is tired.

                         LARRY
               There's a bar across the street:
               the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit
               tight. Give me two hours.


10   INT. BAR- DAY                                                10

     JACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of
     the bar.

     In the background, on the stereo, The White Stripes cover One
     More Cup of Coffee.

     JACK stares at himself in the mirror. He looks exhausted.


11   INT. BAR- DAY                                                11

     JACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of
     the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door
     to the bathrooms.

     He lights a cigarette.

     LARRY comes in and sits opposite him.

                         LARRY
                   (genuinely shocked)
               You started smoking again?

     JACK exhales.

                           JACK
               Guess so.
                                                         7.


                    LARRY
          Since when?

                       JACK
          Since now.

The WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table.

                       WAITER
          Cafe?

                       LARRY
          Due.

The WAITER disappears.

A beat.

LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.

                    LARRY
          Stockholm account. Final
          installment.

JACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket.

LARRY is about to speak but stops.

The WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee.

LARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring.

Then speaks low and fast:

                    LARRY
          You can't stay here, Jack. You
          won't see `em coming, not in a big
          city. But you can't go far, either.
          If the gentlemen whose accounts you
          closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo,
          Simenov- any of the first division-
          you have four or five hours at most
          before every airport, train
          station, bus stop, toll booth and
          ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje
          is under surveillance.

JACK smokes.

                       JACK
          So.

Not a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly
what he's talking about. And JACK is listening.
                                                           8.


                         LARRY
               So. You find a hole- somewhere
               nearby- and you crawl into it and
               you stay put until I say it's safe
               to come out.

     JACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face.

                         LARRY
               Turn right outside the bar then
               second left. Via Spinetti. You'll
               find a silver Citroen C2 with
               Chieti plates. Check the glove box
               and follow the map. Castelvecchio.
               It's a fucking fortress. Literally.
               And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone
               within a three to five mile radius
               you'll see `em coming.

     He pushes something across the table. A MOBILE PHONE in a
     cellophane bag.

                         LARRY
               Get there. Stay there.

     LARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his
     mouth with a napkin.

                         LARRY
               Do nothing `till you get my call.


12   INT. CAR- DAY                                               12

     JACK gets into a compact Citroen C2: nothing flash.

     He opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA
     ENVELOPE.

     Inside the envelope is:

     -a PASSPORT bearing Jack's photo in the name of Edward Clarke

     -a DRIVER'S LICENSE in the same name

     -and a MAP.


13   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                        13

     A long tunnel: one of the longest in Europe.

     JACK at the wheel.

     It seems like night: red stripes, strip lights, shadows.

     Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes.
                                                             9.


     A button of light, expanding...

     ...as we burst into daylight.


14   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  14

     We're in another world.

     JACK'S CAR is winding its way up a twisting mountain road
     towards...

     ...a ramshackle, lonely, desolate Italian HILLTOP TOWN.

     The town sits beneath it's own castle. Medieval towers,
     gables, streets and church bells: framed by the snow-capped
     mountain peaks beyond.

     This is not the Italy of E.M. Forster or of Bella Tuscany.
     This is the Italy where the Crusaders built their fortresses.
     The Italy where Sergio Leone conceived of his great Westerns.

     A CHURCH BELL tolls...


15   EXT. CROSS ROADS- DAY                                        15

     JACK stops the car.

     At the crossroads is a SIGNPOST pointing to the town.

     The sign reads:

                             CASTELVECCHIO.


16   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                         16

     JACK looks at the sign.

     He looks up at the silent town, at the vast stone ramparts.

     An OLD MAN comes out of a crooked medieval doorway, stares at
     JACK and disappears into another building.

     JACK looks at the dead sockets of the windows, random beneath
     the rotting patchwork of rooves.

     A DOG barks. The WIND hisses. The atmosphere is deathly.

     JACK makes a decision.

     And drives away.


17   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  17

     We see JACK'S CAR heading away from CASTELVECCHIO.
                                                          10.


     The CAR crosses a spectacular VIADUCT that spans a deep
     RAVINE.

     The driver's window opens.

     A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag is thrown out.

     It drops hundreds of feet down the ravine.

                                                    FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:


18   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, MAIN SQUARE- DAY                      18

     CASTEL DEL MONTE is a well preserved, happy looking little
     mediaeval town with a handful of tourists.

     A chunk of time has passed.

     JACK is sitting on a table outside a small BAR wearing dark
     glasses, sipping a coffee and reading a guide book. He looks
     like a tastefully dressed, well educated American tourist. He
     blends in. And no one pays him much attention as he finishes
     his coffee, pays his bill, gets up and leaves.

     We follow JACK as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts
     and looks across the spectacular valley...

     ...towards the deserted CASTELVECCHIO.


19   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY                  19

     At a leisurely pace, JACK passes a row of municipal rubbish
     bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town.

     Hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of JACK's parked
     CAR.


20   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      20

     We're right in the heart of the mediaeval old town: like the
     stronghold at the centre of a castle.

     JACK approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off
     the main square.

     The sign reads: "PENSIONE ABRUZZO".


21   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY                                   21

     The internal courtyard is refreshingly cool.
                                                          11.


     In the centre of the courtyard is a FOUNTAIN made of marble
     shot through with black veins.

     In the fountain stands an alabaster STATUE OF A GIRL. She's
     wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water
     falls. The water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre
     diameter pipe made of bronze.

     As JACK crosses the courtyard he glances at the STATUE.

     He finds it hard to tear his eyes away.


22   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                      22

     A toothbrush in the glass by the sink.

     The guidebook on the bedside table.

     Apart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely
     out of his holdall for some time.

     From the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid
     BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS.

     Through his casement window he has good view of
     CASTELVECCHIO.

     He sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical.
     This is a routine assessment.

     JACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old
     man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty.


23   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                    23

     JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide
     awake.

     Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame...

     ...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun.


24   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY                  24

     Blinding SUN fills frame.

     JACK is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval
     architecture, the square, the church.


25   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           25

     The CHURCH is at the top of town. A PRIEST, dressed in black,
     surveys the world below him:
                                                            12.


     Locals are going about their business, a few scattered
     tourists are enjoying their holiday. One `tourist' catches
     the PRIEST's attention.

     Perhaps it's his build. Or the fact that he's the only
     tourist on his own. Or perhaps it's the obsessive grid-like
     methodology with which JACK photographs the little town...


26   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, ALLEYWAY- DAY                         26

     JACK turns casually down one of the town's many narrow
     alleyways.

     The alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind
     corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches,
     criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by
     outside stairwells. It's a stalker's heaven- or hell-
     depending on how dangerous the prey.

     JACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a
     crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge. Each
     alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of
     steepness. JACK photographs each alleyway.

     From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game
     show on television. From another alleyway comes the sound of
     a barking dog.

     No dog is visible.

     Curious, JACK turns around, walking back the way he came.

     The sound of barking gets louder.

     On his right hand side, JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY.

     The HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archer's slit but is big
     enough for a gown man to slip through. Unlike a window, the
     `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence
     of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls.
     The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap
     between them very, very difficult to spot.

     JACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY.

     Inside is a courtyard.


27   INT. COURTYARD- DAY                                          27

     Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms.

     A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash
     keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK.

     JACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and
     fury.
                                                          13.


28   EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY- DAY                                    28

     JACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into
     the narrow alleyway. It's like he's materialised from thin
     air.

     He takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS:

     -first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY

     -and then of the street sign: VIA ROMANA.

     Just then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the
     alleyway and drives towards him.

     Casually, JACK continues walking.

     The DUCATI gets nearer. The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a
     black crash helmet with a tinted visor.

     JACK picks up his pace.

     The DUCATI is ten metres away.

     JACK's right hand moves towards his pocket.

     Five metres.

     JACK's hand goes in his pocket.

     Two metres.

     BANG!

     JACK drops to his knees.

     BANG!

     The DUCATI backfires for a second time.

     A pause.

     Still on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace.

     The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up
     the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his
     helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late
     sixties.

     He glances at JACK.

     JACK stands.

                          MAN ON DUCATI
                Buon giorno!

                          JACK
                Buon giorno.
                                                            14.


                            MAN ON DUCATI
                  Da dove provenite?

     For an instant, the directness of the question catches JACK
     out.

                             JACK
                  America.

                            MAN ON DUCATI
                  Ah! L'Americano!

                            JACK
                  Si. Il Americano.

     JACK's pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty.
     Perhaps he's playing up on this. It suits the role of
     American tourist.

     The MAN laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct
     grammar:

                            MAN ON DUCATI
                  L'Americano ! L'Americano!

     A WOMAN'S VOICE comes from within the house- loud and angry-
     distracting the MAN ON THE DUCATI, who screams back
     passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him
     with a hearty slam.

     JACK walks on.


29   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      29

     JACK puts some coins in a CIGARETTE MACHINE.

     The MACHINE takes his money but won't dispense his
     cigarettes.

     He hits the refund button but nothing happens.

     JACK checks the time.

     And thumps the machine hard.

     Footsteps.

     JACK adjusts his position and checks the time again.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can I help you?

     The man behind him is reflected in the surface of JACK's
     battered ROLEX.

                            JACK
                  I'm no good with machines.
                                                     15.


JACK turns, smiling politely.

The PRIEST smiles back.

He is dressed in an ill-fitting, un-stylish black suit, a
black silk stock and a deep Roman collar fraying at the edge.
His name is FATHER BENEDETTO. He is older than JACK.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          You are American.

This is stated matter-of-factly: like a man practising
English.

                    JACK
          Si.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          You speak Italian?

                    JACK
          Poco.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Va bene! You stay at Pensione
          Arbruzzo.

Also a statement: this time with touch of triumph.

JACK is disconcerted but doesn't show it.

                    JACK
          Not for much longer.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          On vacation?

                    JACK
          Working vacation.

This much is true- after a fashion. They speak in English
unless otherwise specified:

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Lavoro? Che genere de lavoro?

                    JACK
          Photographer.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Va bene. Che genere de fotografia?

                    JACK
          Pictures of the region.
          Architecture, landscapes...

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          People?
                                                          16.


     He stands straight and smiles winningly.

                         JACK
               No people. Sights and landmarks.
               For guidebooks, magazines...

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Ah! Magazine! Which magazine?

     JACK shows no discomfort.

                         JACK
               Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of
               different publications. Um... Casa
               editrice.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Va bene. So you must share a glass
               of wine with me. Questa sera. This
               evening.

     A beat.

     JACK is slightly thrown.

                         JACK
               You're very kind, but I...

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Certo. You want to know the truth
               about Abruzzo? A priest sees
               everything.


30   EXT. PAY PHONE, CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY                      30

     JACK is using the local PAY PHONE.

                         LARRY (V.O.)
               Do you have any idea how long I've
               been trying to reach you? What
               happened to the cell I gave you?

     JACK speaks quietly, keeping an eye on the town square:

                         JACK
               Did I forget to mention my
               electromagnetic hypersensitivity?

                         LARRY (V.O.)
               Don't get jumpy on me, Jack. That
               cell was secure.

     JACK lights a cigarette.
                                                          17.


                          LARRY (V.O.)
                I've got a job. It's a custom fit.
                You don't even have to pull the
                trigger.

                          JACK
                Who's the client?

                          LARRY (V.O.)
                Relax. She triple checks out. Plus
                she comes to you. You don't have to
                move an inch.

                          JACK
                This is a small town, Larry. I
                don't like small towns. I grew up
                in one. Besides, I'm already
                attracting attention.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
                So will anyone who's trying to kill
                you.

     This is a good point.

     JACK lights a cigarette.

                          JACK
                I'll think about it.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
                Think about this. I cleaned up your
                shit and made you disappear. You
                owe me my usual twenty percent
                commission plus the first
                installment. The rest is yours.
                After this you're free.

     On JACK.

     Turning over the word.


31   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR                    31

     The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook
     the hilltop town.

     JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt.

     He's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of
     a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet
     secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun.

     FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a
     globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like
     a honey bee hovering over a bloom.
                                                     18.


                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Que siamo! The quality of the
          brandy is good, the liquor is
          smooth and the glass warmed by the
          sun.

He pronounces warmed "war-med". His English is sophisticated
but quaint, like an out-of-date book.

JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a
connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of
a Presidential beverage.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
              (in ENGLISH)
          The only good thing to come from
          the Francesi, everything else...

FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces.

                     FATHER BENEDETTO
          The French are... pezzi di merda.
          This is not an American discovery.
          Italians have known this for
          centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome
          called France the province of Gaul,
          they were just the same. Arrogant
          sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy
          and their wine effeminate. Only
          their brandy is worthy of any
          attention.

FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
              (in ENGLISH)
          Forgive me. I speak too fast. You
          study our history?

                    JACK
          No.

FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          You come to Italy to make a guide
          book and you don't care about
          history?

                    JACK
          I take pictures, father.

A beat.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Of course. You are American. You
          think you can escape history. You
          live for the present.
                                                            19.


     A beat.

     JACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but
     humane.

     JACK sips his brandy.

                         JACK
               I try to, father.


32   EXT. L'AQUILA- EVENING                                       32

     Suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart. L'AQUILA is the
     capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to
     Castel del Monte and Castelveccio.

     Like these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated,
     nestled high up in the Appenine mountains.


33   EXT. L'AQUILA, SHOPPING STREET- EVENING                      33

     JACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of
     groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street.


34   EXT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA- EVENING                        34

     JACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY. It's a small,
     inconspicuous sign, but it catches his eye because its
     graphics are subtly lewd and it's attached to the buzzer of
     what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block.

     Entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year-
     old Italian girl.

     CLARA.

     She catches JACK's eye.

     He walks on.


35   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 35

     The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple,
     pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts.

     On his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of
     PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories:

           1. Street plan

           2. Exit routes/car

           3. Exit routes/foot
                                                           20.


     Now he is cleaning and oiling his WALTHER PPK/S.


36   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                      36

     JACK completes his morning exercises then showers and
     dresses. His manner is precise and methodical. Only a man who
     has lived alone for many years can live like this.

     When his preparations are complete, he picks up his
     BINOCULARS and studies the nearby town of CASTELVECCHIO
     through his medieval casement window.


37   EXT. CASTELVECCIO, JACK'S POV- CONTINUOUS                    37

     The dead town has come to life!

     There's a MARKET in progress. The central piazza is a hive of
     activity. Food, local produce, clothes and cheap CD stalls.

     The market has attracted TOURISTS. Standing by a phone box
     not far from a cheese stall is an attractive WOMAN in dark
     glasses. She's rifling through her handbag, searching for
     something. Under her right arm is a rolled up copy of Il
     Messaggero.

     We notice the front page of the Italian daily newspaper has
     been folded in half.


38   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- CONTINUOUS               38

     JACK lowers his binoculars.

     Thinks.

     Decides to proceed with caution.


39   EXT. CASTELVECCHIO- DAY                                      39

     Moving through the busy market, JACK is also carrying a copy
     of Il Messaggero...

     ...with the front page folded in half.

     He approaches the OLD WOMAN running a cheese stall.

                         JACK
               Un po' di formaggio, per favore.

                         OLD WOMAN
               Quale? Pecorino, parmigiano?

                         JACK
               Questo.
                                                            21.


     He points.

                            JACK
                  E un po' di pecorino.

     JACK glances casually around for the WOMAN.

     She's sitting outside a CAFE about twenty metres away,
     chatting on her cellphone.

     JACK pays for his cheese and approaches the cafe.


40   EXT. CASTELVECCHIO, CAFE- DAY                                40

     JACK sits at an empty table next to the WOMAN.

     She finishes her call in English. She's well spoken. As she
     replaces the phone in her handbag, she knocks the newspaper
     off her table.

     JACK picks it up.

                            WOMAN
                  Grazie.

                            JACK
                  Prego. You're welcome.

                            WOMAN
                  You're American.

                            JACK
                  "Amidst gathering clouds".

     The WOMAN speaks quickly, purposefully, barely looking at
     JACK.

                            WOMAN
                  You're assuming I'm English or
                  you'd never have mentioned the
                  weather. In fact I'm Belgian but I
                  went to boarding school in England.
                  And am quite happy to converse on
                  all subjects meteorological.

     Judging by her stilted choice of words this is code.

     A WAITER comes out and flicks a cloth over the table. It's
     nearly midday and the sun is hot. He speaks with a tired
     voice:

                            WAITER
                  Buon giorno. Desidera?

     He's addressing the WOMAN.
                                                     22.


                    WOMAN
          Una spremute di limone. Per favore.

Her Italian accent is perfect.

                       WAITER
          Signore?

The WOMAN looks at JACK for the first time, studying him,
awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it.

                    JACK
          Una gelata alla fragola. Per
          favore.

The final fail safe.

Now they can introduce themselves:

                       JACK
          Edward.

                       WOMAN
          Mathilde.

The identification process over, there is nothing more to do
but get down to business- and conversation becomes suddenly
awkward.

                    MATHILDE
          It's hot. My car has no air
          conditioning. I asked for it,
          but...

She trails off.

                    JACK
          What car did they give you?

Her HAZEL eyes flick over the crowd in front of the cafe.

She doesn't answer.

JACK clears his throat.

Then says quietly:

                       JACK
          Range?

She takes a long time to answer. When she does, she does so
over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd
like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by
her husband.

                    MATHILDE
          One fifty to one seven five meters.
                                                        23.


                       JACK
          Time?

                    MATHILDE
          Five seconds. Seven at the most.

                       JACK
          Targets?

                       MATHILDE
          One.

                       JACK
          Fire rate?

                       MATHILDE
          Rapid.

                    JACK
          Magazine capacity?

                    MATHILDE
          Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum.

The WAITER delivers the Spremuta and the raspberry ice-cream.

The glass of lemon juice twists in MATHILDE's slender
fingers.

                    MATHILDE
          The weapon must be fairly light.
          And compact. Possible to be broken
          down into its constituent parts.

                    L'AMERICANO
          How compact?

                    MATHILDE
          As compact as possible.

JACK clears his throat.

                    JACK
          You want a submachine gun to fit in
          a lady's purse?

                    MATHILDE
          A small vanity case would be
          permissible.

                    JACK
          A small briefcase would be
          possible.

A beat.
                                                        24.


                     JACK
           X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD
           player, MP3 or digital camera?

She's not sure if he's joking or not. Neither are we.

                     MATHILDE
           Not necessary.

                        JACK
           Noise?

                        MATHILDE
           Silencer.

                     JACK
           No such thing. You'll have to make
           do with a suppressor like everyone
           else. It'll dampen the decibels,
           dislocate the sound source and
           reduce muzzle flash. I can't make
           you silent but I can make you
           invisible as the Finnish phrase
           goes, but only as long as you're
           prepared to lose some range.

JACK scans the crowd.

On the other side of the square he spots a YOUNG MAN in his
mid-thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn,
hovering by a stall. Average height, slim, athletic build;
sunglasses, stone-washed designer jeans very neatly pressed
with a sharp crease.

                     JACK
           Two o'clock.

                        MATHILDE
           Excuse me?

                     JACK
           By the clothes stall. Light blue
           shirt, open at the neck, expensive
           buff suede shoes. Is he with you?

The YOUNG MAN has disappeared into the crowd.

                     MATHILDE
           I didn't see him. In any case, I'm
           alone.

A pause.

JACK's jaw muscles grind.

                     MATHILDE
           I can accept a slight loss of
           range.
                                                             25.


                          JACK
                You want a weapon with the firing
                capacity of a submachine gun and
                the range of a rifle.

                          MATHILDE
                Can you do it?

     A beat.

                          JACK
                Give me a month. To trial. Then a
                week for final adjustments.


41   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, LANDSCAPE- TWILIGHT                    41

     The sun is sinking.

     It's hunting hour.

     A FALCON hovers on the wind above the town, looking for prey.


42   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                42

     JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed but fast
     asleep.

     His eyes roll left and right beneath his lids.

     He's dreaming.

     In his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART &
     ARCHITECTURE.

     Twitching in his sleep, JACK's grip on the ART & ARCHITECTURE
     BOOK slowly loosens...

     THUD!

     As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and
     rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at
     the door.

     Silence.

     JACK's heart is beating.


43   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- MORNING                   43

     JACK is looking through his BINOCULARS.

     JACK'S POV:

     ...of a small yellow and blue Italian POST OFFICE VAN heading
     up the winding alpine road towards CASTELVECCIO.
                                                             26.


44   EXT. CASTELVECCHIO- DAY                                       44

     With the market gone, the town is once more dead.

     And provides no cover.

     JACK parks his car not far from the town square, turns off
     the engine and gets out.


45   EXT. CASTELVECCHIO, TOWN SQUARE, CAFE- DAY                    45

     JACK is sitting in the CAFE where he met Mathilde.

     He is watching the entrance to the local POST OFFICE.

     He studies his WATCH.

     It's been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny
     rural branch of the Poste Italiane.

     JACK puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets
     up...


46   INT. CASTELVECCHIO, POST OFFICE- DAY                          46

     The shop is small and dusty.

     So is the POSTMASTER.

                         JACK
               Buon giorno.

     The POSTMASTER grunts his reply, jutting his chin.

                         JACK
               Il fermo posta?

     The POSTMASTER turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack
     of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old person's walking
     aid. From one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general
     delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band. Some
     have been there for weeks. Months even.

                         POSTMASTER
               Nome?

     A beat.

                         JACK
               Clarke.

     Deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of
     banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted
     fingers.
                                                            27.


                               POSTMASTER
                  Clarky?

                            JACK
                  Clarke. Una pacchetto.

                               POSTMASTER
                  Pacchetto!

     This makes all the difference. The POSTMASTER clicks again,
     disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes...

                            POSTMASTER
                  Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.

     ...and reappearing with a PACKAGE.

     The PACKAGE is from an Italian PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIERS.

                               JACK
                  Grazie.

                            POSTMASTER
                  Identificazione.

     JACK flicks his eyes downwards. He has already put his
     PASSPORT on the counter.

     The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers.

     Looks from the picture to JACK.

     JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.


47   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ARBRUZZO- EVENING            47

     JACK unwraps the PACKAGE.

     He removes:

     -film

     -photographic paper

     -development fluids

     -fixing solutions

     Then:

     -a solid, monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a
     single piece of lightweight alloy.

     -a bolt assembly.

     -a barrel.
                                                          28.


     Only with this final piece is the puzzle complete.

     Laid out on the floor is a SOCIMI 821 SUB-MACHINE GUN.

     Without touching it, JACK studies the weapon like a
     connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine. In particular he
     notices that the SERIAL NUMBER has been scratched off.

     Then he moves slowly, assembling the weapon with precision
     engineered expertise:

     -inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and
     securing it with the nut,

     -opening the sidefolding tubular stock and engaging the
     buttpad,

     -snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder,

     -looking down the barrel,

     -and slowly squeezing back the finger-grooved TRIGGER as we

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:


48   INT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA, CLARA'S ROOM- NIGHT            48

     Our beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters.

     CLARA.

     She sits on the edge of the bed, whose ageing metal springs
     squeak slightly, and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray
     on the bedside table.

     She kicks off her slip-on shoes.

     Slips off her panties.

     Lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on
     the bed in one practised motion.

     JACK sits on the bed beside her.

     He doesn't look at her.

                          ITALIAN GIRL
               Amore?

     She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to:


49   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PAY PHONE- DAY                        49

     JACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness.
                                                             29.


                         JACK
               Your source in Rome.

                         LARRY (V.O.)
               Clean bill of health and no OC.
               This was a straight favour with a
               dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got
               a second cousin in NOCS on the
               graft who filched him the Socimi.

                         JACK
               I hope you paid below the odds. The
               more you pay them the more cops
               gossip in the locker room.

                         LARRY (V.O.)
               No one's gossiping, Jack.

     JACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other
     side of the square.

                         JACK
               Yet.


50   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                         50

     FATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler.

     This comical and endearing method of rural transportation is
     a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck.

     In the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES.

     The API is turning over but it won't start.

     The bonnet is open. JACK is fixing the engine.

     He gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key
     again.

     This time the engine starts. FATHER BENEDETTO claps and
     cheers.


51   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      51

     Sixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with
     polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique
     sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the
     life of Our Lord.

     The room is filled with a dining table: a massive black
     edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like
     the columns of cathedrals.
                                                             30.


     Using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like
     old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO
     performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat,
     dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables.

     He hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash.

     JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO
     potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own
     wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming.


52   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      52

     JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in
     silence.

     FATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so
     absorbed.

     As soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to
     help himself from the ancient tureen.

     Then he bustles over to the stove, humming again.

     JACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with
     his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid-
     twenties. FABIO.

     FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered
     dish issuing steam into his face.

     He notices JACK's eye-line.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               All the sheep in my flock are dear
               to me, but some are dearer than
               most. Especially those that have
               strayed from the fold.

     Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies:

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car
               doctor'. But I suspect his practice
               is not entirely sound. Ecco!

     FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish
     revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of
               orange juice, orange peel,
               chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine
               and... Come si dici in Inglese?
               Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.
                                                        31.


FATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and
pours white wine into fresh glasses.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Also: salsify in garlic butter.
          Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms
          with truffle.

JACK helps himself to vegetables.

FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste.

JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine.

The two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a
verdict.

                    JACK
          Sinful.

FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          The Holy Father eats better than
          this.

The flash of a smile crosses the priest's face.

                    JACK
          Have you ever wanted to be anything
          other than a priest?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Have you ever wanted to be anything
          other than a... come se dice in
          Inglese...?

                    JACK
          Photographer?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Photographer.

                    JACK
          I do what I'm good at.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          I'm sure you have other talents.
          You have the hands of a craftsman,
          not an artist. You are good with
          machines. Yet you told me just the
          opposite when we first met.

JACK hides his unease from the watchful priest.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Journalism cannot make you a rich
          man.
                                                          32.


     FATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX.

                         JACK
               No.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Perhaps you are rich already?

                         JACK
               I'm not a young man. I have my
               savings.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
                   (in ITALIAN)
               My meagre income is subject to the
               vagaries of the stock market and
               with church attendance declining
               there's less and less money in the
               offertory. But if a man has God in
               his vaults...

     He looks searchingly at JACK.

                         JACK
               I don't think God is interested in
               me. Father.

                          FATHER BENEDETTO
                   (in ENGLISH)
               I know better than to try to make a
               convert over pheasant and
               Trebbiano.

     JACK is silent.

     The two men continue eating.

     Then casually:

                         JACK
               What are the snakes for, father?

     FATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal
     sign for secrecy.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               "The grave soul keeps its own
               secrets, and takes its own
               punishment in silence."

     He has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission to
     extract the truth... and JACK knows it.


53   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- DAY                                  53

     JACK is driving.
                                                            33.


     He checks the rear view mirror.

     All clear.

     JACK accelerates the CAR, driving it hard at the sidewalk.

     The vehicle slams into the curb, mounting the pavement with a
     thump of crunching metal.


54   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE- DAY                                        54

     Just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders
     downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and
     scrap metal yards.

     The CAR moves slowly. We can hear the scrape of trailing
     metal.

     JACK pulls up beside a high chain fence.

     The DOGS on the other side start barking. This sets off other
     dogs in other scrap yards.

     JACK gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut
     beside the fence. Before he's a metre from the door it opens
     and a tough, well-built, unshaven Italian man in his mid-
     twenties looks him up and down.

     FABIO.

                            JACK
                  Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.

     Suspicion gives way suddenly to warmth:

                            FABIO
                  L'Americano?

     JACK smiles politely.

                            JACK
                  Buon giorno.


55   INT. WORKSHOP- DAY                                           55

     The metal door slides open. FABIO leads JACK inside.

     At the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue ALFA ROMEO
     being resprayed white. Beside it, one half of a LANCIA is
     being welded to another.

     JACK knows better than to stare. He follows FABIO through
     to...
                                                            34.


56   INT. BACK OFFICE- DAY                                        56

     Girly calendars, Italian style.

                         JACK
               I'm taking pictures forty minutes
               north of here. Right up in the
               mountains. Father Benedetto said
               you might be able to help.

                         FABIO
                   (in ITALIAN)
               You need models. For your
               photographs? Italian girls?

     He winks at JACK. He's being friendly.

                         JACK
               My publisher wouldn't stretch to a
               four by four and the park trails
               are playing havoc with my chassis.

     The technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp.

     This suits JACK.

                         FABIO
                   (in ITALIAN)
               Want me to take a look?

                         JACK
               Not really. I just need something
               to work on a ruptured driveshaft.

                         FABIO
                   (in ITALIAN)
               You're a mechanic?

                         JACK
               Just a hobby. I tinker.

     JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering
     the work benches.

     FABIO shrugs.

                         FABIO
                   (in ITALIAN)
               Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My
               garage is your garage.

                         JACK
               I appreciate that.

     FABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the
     resprayed Alfa Romeo.
                                                            35.


     JACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work
     surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet.

     Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers
     several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the
     biggest one up.

                          JACK
               Bene?

     FABIO is engrossed his work.

                         FABIO
               Si! Si! Va bene!

                          JACK
               Quant'e?

     FABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless
     to him.

                          FABIO
               Niente!

     JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and
     puts it in the sports bag with the tools.

     At the door, he pauses.

     That's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of
     FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this
     photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma
     football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy.

                         JACK
               Ciao. Grazie.

                         FABIO
               Ciao, Americano!


57   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           57

     FATHER BENEDETTO rings the CHURCH BELLS for Mass.


58   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH TOWER- CONTINUOUS              58

     THREE CHURCH BELLS ringing: large, medium and small.

     As the CLAPPERS hit the SOUNDBOWS we smash cut to:


59   INT. JACK'S ROOM, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- CONTINUOUS               59

     JACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone
     floor of his room.
                                                          36.


     Beside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN.

     Using the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover...

     ...JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes
     it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET.


60   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                                 60

     By torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed
     steel gear.

     It's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor
     light.


61   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  61

     JACK is wearing a knapsack. He's crossing a MEADOW and making
     his way towards a RUINED HAMLET. His manner is dark,
     purposeful, alert.

     The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade. JACK stops.
     Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers.

     His guardedness begins to evaporate. He has never seen
     anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted. He looks
     around, transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves, brash
     whites, harsh and brilliant crimsons, exquisite blues. The
     air is humming with insects, bees and butterflies.

     JACK is transfixed.


62   EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY                                      62

     JACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses, sweating in
     the heat.

     His original cautiousness has returned. Carefully, he checks
     the area for signs of recent disturbance. From the foot of
     the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars,
     monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human
     activity. Satisfied that he's alone, he takes a deep breath
     of mountain air.

     And scrambles back down to the valley.


63   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                              63

     JACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample
     WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a LAKE.

     JACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a
     patch of soft grass beside the water.
                                                       37.


This, he decides, is the perfect spot. He unrolls a blanket,
kneels, and from his KNAPSACK he produces:

-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
chilled bottle of Frascati

-a loaf of course bread

-50 gms of pecorino

-100 gms of proscuitto

-a small jar of black olives

-an orange

-and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of
the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

JACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX.

It takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the
bastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND
SUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS
into the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip,
snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the
rubber cup on the sight.

He's fast.

Carefully he surveys the lake. Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS.
And with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates
until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still.

A beat...

...as JACK holds his breath. Then squeezes the trigger.

CHOOP!

CHOOP!

CHOOP!

Not the conventional "phut, phut, phut" of a movie silencer,
but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a TAC 65 sound
suppressor.

Through the sight we see the water churn at four o'clock to
the REED CLUMP and four metres off.

From the knapsack, JACK takes a watchmaker's steel-handled
screwdriver and adjusts the sight, then loads another ten
rounds in the magazine.

CHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!
                                                          38.


     The reeds are clipped, the bullets slapping into the bank
     behind, mud spurting.

     JACK adjusts again and reloads.

     CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!

     The reed clump is shot to shit.


64   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY                                   64

     The sound of CHURCH BELLS.

     JACK is at work:

     -modifying the SOUND SUPPRESSOR to make it more efficient

     -filing the CONNECTORS until the trigger squeeze is softer

     -adjusting the position of the TELESCOPIC SIGHT mountings

     And finally:

     -checking the balance of the weapon: JACK poises it on the
     edge of a ruler over the pencil mark he has determined to be
     the gun's centre of gravity.

                    The SOCIMI balances perfectly.

     By now the sun is low and the light fading. JACK's eyes are
     sore and his fingers aching.

     He sits on his bed with his hands on his knees, silent in the
     dying light.


65   INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT                           65

     We're in the living room of a small apartment. It's simply
     and attractively furnished. There are 2 GIRLS: not obviously
     hookers.

     The FIRST GIRL is on her mobile phone. Every now and again
     she glances at JACK. The SECOND GIRL approaches him for a
     light.

                         JACK
               E Clara qui?
               [Is Clara here?]

                         SECOND GIRL
               Non e stasera qui.
               [She's not here tonight.]

     She loops her arm through JACK's.
                                                             39.


                          SECOND GIRL
               Volete una bevanda?
               [Would you like a drink?]

     JACK shakes his head.

                         JACK
               Forse un altro tempo.
               [Perhaps another time.]


66   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT                                  66

     JACK parks in his usual hiding spot and heads for his
     pensione.

     A hundred yards ahead of him on the other side of the street
     is the same YOUNG MAN he spotted in Castelveccio.

     Cautiously, so as not to spook him, JACK continues walking,
     passing his pensione and heading for the town square.

     The YOUNG MAN is four parked cars away, leaning against a
     Fiat parked in front of a small pharmacy, his right hand on
     the roof, bending over as if speaking to the car's local
     occupant who appears to be giving him directions.

     Twice he looks up and gazes along the street in both
     directions, casually, as if keeping an eye open for passing
     traffic in the narrow street.

     ...JACK side steps swiftly into the local bar.


67   INT. BAR- DAY                                                 67

     Crowded with locals. JACK orders a coffee.

     Through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on
     the YOUNG MAN. But the darkness outside throws back
     reflections of the bright neon-lit bar within.

     One reflection catches our attention.

     The Italian girl. CLARA.

     She is drinking and laughing with friends, young Italians
     like her. She catches sight of JACK.

     He turns away.


68   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT                                  68

     JACK comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket.

     No sign of the YOUNG MAN.
                                                          40.


     He slips down a side street.


69   EXT. SIDE STREETS- NIGHT                                   69

     JACK slips from one side street to another taking full
     advantage of short-cuts, alleyways and crumbling walls. His
     route is circuitous. It betrays a perfect knowledge of the
     maze-like back streets of the town.

     Eventually JACK peeps out of a tiny passageway half-way down
     his own street and on the opposite side of the road from his
     PENSIONE.

     The entrance to the PENSIONE is clear.

     JACK crosses the street and slips inside.


70   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                               70

     We're in the corridor outside JACK'S ROOM.

     JACK takes his right hand from his pocket.

     He's clutching the WALTHER.

     Slowly, he reaches his left hand upwards, towards the lintel
     above the door where he finds...

     ...a single FEATHER.


71   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    71

     From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned
     deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made.

     JACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits
     on the bed.


72   EXT. ROADSIDE PAY PHONE- MORNING                           72

     A cluster of houses by the side of a main road: a bar, a
     restaurant, a phone box.

     JACK puts a coin in the slot. Two rings.

                            LARRY (V.O.)
               Jack?

                         JACK
               I've got company.

     JACK scans the area outside.
                                                     41.


                    JACK
          If he's not baby-sitting the
          Belgian contract then he's either a
          Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not
          with The Company, they're fast:
          it's been three days and no TA.
          He's not intel: they're deep
          background and he wants to be
          noticed. He might be a cowboy but
          he can't be a cop: they work in
          pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda
          di Finanza, State Police and NOCS:
          he's not Italian- he doesn't look
          like one, dress like one or behave
          like one. So who the hell is he?

A beat.

                    JACK
          Larry?

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          You got a long list of enemies,
          Jack.

                    JACK
          What's he waiting for?

JACK hears the sound of an engine.

His hand moves to his pocket.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          Jack?

He watches a black VW SHARON pass. There's a family inside.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          Want me to help take care of this?

                    JACK
          I can handle it.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          You sound spooked.

                    JACK
          It's a bad line.

                    LARRY (V.O.)
          Jack?

                    JACK
          Yes?
                                                          42.


                           LARRY (V.O.)
                 I appreciate the value of a pre-
                 emptive strike in circumstances
                 like these, I really do, but if
                 you're going to go Generation Kill
                 then do me a favour, OK, because
                 I'm running out of bribe money. [A
                 BEAT] Make it look like an
                 accident.


73   EXT. TRAIN STATION- DAY                                    73

     Little more than a halt: one platform, one track, one station
     building- locked and shuttered.

     JACK steps out of his car.

     No one around.

     He checks his watch: it's exactly noon.

     A TRAIN approaches.

     It's a three-carriage local. It rattles round the bend in the
     track up the valley, diesel fumes pluming. There are no more
     than a dozen passengers on board.

     MATHILDE is the only one to alight.

     Her once brown hair is now BLONDE. She's wearing a light
     summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag.

     They shake hands as the train pulls away, belching and
     honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and
     crosses some alpine rapids.

                           MATHILDE
                 Mr. Clarke. How good to see you
                 again.

     Something quaint, old fashioned in her diction. English with
     the hint of a Belgian accent.

     JACK opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag
     beside a WICKER PICNIC HAMPER.

                           MATHILDE
                 Refreshments?

                           JACK
                 The Carabinieri around here like
                 roadblocks. It's cover.

     She nods.

     They get into the car.
                                                           43.


     As the JACK's door slams we smash cut to:


74   INT. CAR- DAY                                                74

     MATHILDE's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape.

                            MATHILDE
                  You picked a beautiful spot.

     She takes off her shades.

     Her once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE.

     She glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior.

                            MATHILDE
                  You would be hard pressed to make a
                  fast get away in this.

     Perhaps she's nervous. Her attempt at humour isn't working
     and she stumbles slightly on her grammar:

                            MATHILDE
                  I would have thought you to have
                  had at least an Alfa Romeo.

                            JACK
                  This attracts less attention.

                               MATHILDE
                  Is it far?

                            JACK
                  Fifty minutes.

     She looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over
     head.

                               MATHILDE
                  Up there?

     JACK nods.

     She eases herself back, resigned to a long climb.

                            MATHILDE
                  The train was tiring. One has to
                  keep alert so much in cities.

     Her eyelids are drooping.

                            JACK
                  I'll wake you before the turn-off.

     She smiles gratefully. But does not shut her tired eyes.

     The CLOCK on the dash reads 12:17
                                                           44.


75   INT. CAR- DAY                                                75

     JACK negotiates the alpine road, leaning into the steering
     wheel, shifting up or down a gear and glancing from the
     mirror to the road and back again

     MATHILDE is asleep.

     JACK scans her, taking in every detail: her low-heeled shoes
     are expensive but she wears no jewelry except a Seiko wrist-
     watch on a metal strap and a thin gold chain at her throat.
     Her tan is light, her breasts neat and her legs shapely and
     recently waxed.

     But JACK doesn't look at her like an object of desire. He
     looks at her cautiously, with an expression that says: "this
     young woman is ruthless. If she were not, she wouldn't be
     alive."

     That's when he notices the CAR in his rear view mirror.

     It's too far behind to decipher the make or model and it
     weaves in and out of frame as JACK negotiates the alpine
     road.

     MATHILDE wakes with a start. The CLOCK on the dash reads
     13:05.

                         MATHILDE
               Are we nearly there?

                         JACK
               The turn-off's up ahead.

     His eyes flick to the rear view mirror. Hers to the wing.

     She spots the CAR behind. JACK catches her eye questioningly.

                         MATHILDE
               I told you I work alone.

     JACK slows just before the turn off and pulls over.

     Then stops.

     Now its MATHILDE's turn to look questioning.

                         JACK
               Just a precaution.

     He gets out of the car and pretends to urinate.

     The CAR behind passes at speed.

     A blue Seat. The driver neither slows down nor looks in their
     direction.

     JACK gets back in the car.
                                                           45.


     And turns off up a dirt track that disappears into the
     meadows.


76   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                              76

     JACK parks his CITROEN in the shade of the squat but ample
     WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a large LAKE. This is
     the exact spot where he came to test the weapon.

     MATHILDE gets out of the car and stretches.

                         MATHILDE
               Are those houses occupied?

     JACK looks at the RUINED HAMLET on the hillside.

                         JACK
               Derelict. I checked three days ago.

                         MATHILDE
               We should check again.

                         JACK
               I'll check alone. There are adders
               the mountains. And vipers. Your
               shoes.

                         MATHILDE
               I'll be careful.

     Her voice is curt. The trust she showed him in the car is
     gone now.


77   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  77

     They cross a meadow and make their way towards the RUINED
     HAMLET. The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade.
     JACK walks in front to ward off any snakes.

     Everywhere there is a profusion of wild meadow flowers.
     MATHILDE has never seen anything so beautiful. Overwhelmed,
     she stops.

     JACK stops. And watches her.

     She undergoes the same transformation that he did.

     Then she comes to, remembering herself... and walks on.

     Suddenly... a four foot ASP VIPER slithers across JACK's
     path.

     He claps his hands and the SNAKE writhes for cover.
                                                          46.


     JACK walks on. MATHILDE follows, pretending not to be
     frightened but walking closer to JACK now, scanning the long
     grass warily.


78   EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY                                    78

     JACK scrambles up towards the houses, checking the area for
     signs of recent disturbance. MATHILDE follows.

     From beside the end building JACK surveys the valley with a
     tiny pair of binoculars, monitoring every square on the
     imaginary grid for human activity.

                         MATHILDE
               You have tested the gun here
               before?

                         JACK
               Yes.

     Satisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE
     takes a deep breath of mountain air.

                         MATHILDE
               It's beautiful here.

     She is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was
     once a terraced field. Her dress dips between her legs as she
     leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees, tired from
     the journey and the long, hot climb.

                         MATHILDE
               I wish everywhere could be this
               tranquil.

     JACK looks at her, sensing a kindred spirit.

                         JACK
               You'd be out of a job.

                         MATHILDE
               You don't like the peace?

                         JACK
               It's hard to like something you
               know nothing about.


79   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                            79

     The WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the
     parked car and the lake. From the hamper, JACK removes:

     -a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
     chilled bottle of Aspirinio

     -a loaf of course bread
                                                     47.


-two clods of mozarella

-150 gms of proscuitto

-100 gms of parma ham

-a large jar of pitted green olives

-a Thermos of sweet black coffee

-and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the
improved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

As MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill,
JACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX.

It takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble
the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND
SUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty
magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to
her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the
sight.

She's almost ten seconds faster than JACK.

He stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs
and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and
everything it means.

                    MATHILDE
          Rounds?

                    JACK
          I've made up two sorts.

He reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER.

                    JACK
          Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.

                    MATHILDE
          I should like a hundred of each.

It's an order: her voice is emotionless.

                    MATHILDE
          And fifty explosive.

                    JACK
          Not a problem.

He hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge
boxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays.

                    JACK
          Will mercury do?

She smiles almost imperceptibly.
                                                     48.


                    MATHILDE
          Mercury will do very nicely.

She puts the gun down butt-first, leaning it against the side
of the car.

                    MATHILDE
          I have made my own targets.

She reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes
several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split
bamboo cane.

Without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. In
her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass
crickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer
skirt sweeps across the flowers.

                    JACK
          Watch out for vipers.

He keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving
with her right hand: the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES.
She's no fool.

Neither is he. He has the gun.

At ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth
stones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple
trumpet blooms.

She unfolds the cardboard. At this distance all we can make
out is a silver-grey shape against the stones.

Returning to the car she picks up the weapon.

                    MATHILDE
          Muzzle velocity?

                    JACK
          At least three hundred and sixty
          miles per hour. That's including
          twenty off the top for the sound
          suppression.

Impressed, MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the
serial number has been removed with acid.

                    MATHILDE
          Socimi?

                    JACK
          Eight-two-one.

                    MATHILDE
          I've not had one before.
                                                     49.


                       JACK
             You'll find it easy. I've re-
             balanced it for the longer barrel.
             The fulcrum is two centimetres
             forward of the grip now. Which
             won't matter if you're firing- and
             I'm guessing you are- from a fixed
             position.

No answer.

                       JACK
             No major recoil issues. You should
             be able to hold onto any target.
             Even the smallest.

MATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and
stands with her feet apart, braced. The breeze beneath the
walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against
her legs.

CHOOP! CHOOP!

For a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the
gun, holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt
would hold a 12 bore.

                       MATHILDE
             You've done a good job, Mr. Clarke.
             Thank you. Thank you very much.

She makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight, with
her fingernail. She can't have turned the vertical screw more
than one notch.

Then she fully loads and fires again.

CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!

JACK lifts his binoculars and looks at the target. It's the
unmistakable outline of a BOEING 747-400, about one and a
half metres long. Painted against the cut-out is the upturn
at the end of the wing. The front doorway is shaded in.
Standing in it is the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. In the centre of
his head are three small HOLES.

With the magazine containing the remaining 28 jacketed
rounds, MATHILDE takes aim again.

CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!

Through his binoculars, JACK can see the empty space where
the target's head used to be, the scarred stones behind and
the little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm air.

                          JACK
             Good shot.
                                                     50.


MATHILDE says nothing. She fills the magazine with lead
rounds, snaps it in place and hands the weapon to JACK.

                    MATHILDE
          Go to the stones and fire near me.

He's taken aback.

                       MATHILDE
          Say...

She looks round for a target.

                    MATHILDE
          ...into the bush with the yellow
          flowers. Two bursts. Five seconds
          apart.

Slowly, JACK walks down to the stones, turns and looks back.
The CITROEN is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut
tree. So is MATHILDE. In the poor light all he can see is her
dress and her blouse. He wipes the sweat from his eyes and
shuts them tightly.

This is not just a weapon test... it's a test of trust.

He opens his eyes again.

MATHILDE turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon.

He aims the SOCIMI at the YELLOW FLOWERS right beside her.

Holds his breath.

And pulls the trigger.

CHOOP! CHOOP!

MATHILDE remains untouched.

So do the YELLOW FLOWERS.

Troubled, JACK blinks rapidly and counts to five.

Then he fires again.

CHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!

Through the sight, we see two stems of YELLOW BLOSSOM fall
sideways.

Relieved, JACK walks slowly back to the car.

                    MATHILDE
          The sound suppression is superb. I
          couldn't place the direction of
          fire.
                                                        51.


From her sports bag she removes a plain brown MANILLA
ENVELOPE.

                       MATHILDE
             I shall require the rounds and the
             weapon by the first of next month.
             In the meantime would you tighten
             the adjusting screws on the sight,
             they are too loose. And lengthen
             the stock by three centimetres. I
             also want a sixty round magazine.

                       JACK
             You'll upset the balance.

                       MATHILDE
             I'm prepared to accept that.

                       JACK
             Then I'm happy to oblige.

                       MATHILDE
             What about the a case?

                       JACK
             A briefcase. Samsonite. Standard
             pattern in black with combination
             locks. Is there a number you'd
             prefer?

She thinks.

                       MATHILDE
             Eight-two-one.

                       JACK
             Eight-two-one.

MATHILDE hands him the ENVELOPE and disassembles the weapon.

JACK wraps the SOCIMI parts up in their cloth squares and
places them in the bottom of the PICNIC HAMPER.

                       MATHILDE
             What do you want done with these?

She has collected up the spent CARTRIDGE CASES.

                       JACK
             Throw them in the lake.

She walks down to the water and hurls the brass cases in.

FISH rise.

Again, the beauty of the place transfixes her.

By the time she turns back, JACK has laid out the picnic.
                                                        52.


                    MATHILDE
          How thoughtful.

She picks up a bottle of wine.

                    MATHILDE
          I don't know Italian wine.

                     JACK
          Aspirinio. Like Mosacata but
          frizzante.

Deftly he uncorks a bottle.

And pours it into the grass.

                    JACK
          It wouldn't look right if the
          picnic wasn't touched.

                    MATHILDE
          You chilled the wine. I thought...

                    JACK
          It had to be chilled. They're
          Italian cops.

                    MATHILDE
              (disappointed)
          You think of everything.

                    JACK
          I'm paid to. Don't move.

She freezes.

JACK points slowly.

On her tanned forearm is a BUTTERFLY.

                      MATHILDE
          Wow.

They both stare at the insect, transfixed.

                    MATHILDE
          It's so beautiful.

                    JACK
          Parnassius apollo. It's endangered.

She looks up at him. Like it's a revelation she says:

                    MATHILDE
          You like coming here.

                    JACK
          It serves its purpose.
                                                          53.


                         MATHILDE
               You've never taken a woman here
               before?

     JACK is momentarily taken aback.

                            JACK
               No.

     The BUTTERFLY flits away.

                         MATHILDE
                   (sadly)
               Perhaps you do not have a woman in
               your life. It is not easy for us to
               keep relationships. Not in our
               world.

                         JACK
               I have an acquaintance.

     A beat.

     She waits for him to say more.

     He doesn't.

                         MATHILDE
               Friendships are transitory. It
               is...

     Suddenly, there's movement in the bushes.

     JACK snatches up his BINOCULARS. MATHILDE scans the tree
     cover.

                            JACK
               Wild boar.

     He hands her the binoculars. And hurriedly packs up the
     picnic.


80   INT. CAR- DAY                                              80

     Her sunglasses back on, MATHILDE watches the meadows slip
     backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back
     down the alpine track.

                         MATHILDE
               I wish you hadn't brought me here.

     Again... a real sadness.

     JACK glances at her.
                                                          54.


                            MATHILDE
                  This is the sort of place I wish
                  I'd discovered by myself. Then
                  maybe one day I could have retired
                  here. But you already know it.

     JACK is touched.

                            JACK
                  I'm much older than you. By the
                  time you've retired I'll be dead.


81   EXT. RURAL TRAIN STATION- DAY                                81

     The CITROEN pulls up.


82   INT. CITROEN- DAY                                            82

     The YOUNG WOMAN's manner is once more tense and formal.

                            MATHILDE
                  We will meet as before?

     JACK nods.

     The distant sound of a DIESEL ENGINE. The train is
     approaching.

                            MATHILDE
                  On the first of next month?

     He nods again.

                            MATHILDE
                  Around noon?

     Not even a nod this time: just a slow blink.

     MATHILDE opens the door, runs around to the boot and grabs
     her canvas sports bag. Then returns to the passenger side of
     the car and looks in.

                             MATHILDE
                  Thank you for a lovely day. Mr.
                  Butterfly.

     She leans in..

     ...and kisses him lightly on the cheek, her lips light and
     quick on his stubble.

                            MATHILDE
                  You must take your mistress to the
                  meadow for a picnic.
                                                          55.


     She closes the car door, walks onto the platform and vanishes
     onto a waiting carriage. The TRAIN honks and belches, moving
     off down the track in the direction from which it came.

     JACK watches it go.

     And drives off.

     Confused.


83   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, LOCAL BAR- NIGHT                      83

     Two OLD MEN drinking beer at the bar. Two more at a table,
     playing Scopa with old fashioned Trentine playing cards.

     Sitting at the back of the room, JACK stares at a shot of
     Grappa.

     Above him, mounted on the wall, is a TELEVISION. On the TV is
     a Western: Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in ONCE UPON A
     TIME IN THE WEST.

     JACK downs his shot, gets up and walks over to the bar. Pays.

     The BARMAN nods at the screen.

                           BARMAN
                 Sergio Leone. Italiano.

     JACK turns and looks.

     HENRY FONDA in close-up, is about to shoot a red headed BOY
     of seven in the head.

     JACK stares. Just at the moment that the gun goes off...

     ...JACK turns away.

                           BARMAN
                     (in poor ENGLISH)
                 You like cow boy movie?

     JACK thinks.

     Then shakes his head.

                           JACK
                 Hokey.


84   INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT                           84

     CLARA and JACK are naked.

     JACK tries to kiss her on the lips but CLARA turns away: just
     enough to let him know this is against the rules.
                                                          56.


     JACK kisses her neck. Her breasts. Her stomach.

     As he moves his head between her legs, her fingers (already
     ensnared in his hair) tighten their grip, stopping him from
     going further.

     JACK looks up at CLARA, across her belly, and she looks back
     at him, her expression fixed yet curious.

     Against her rules but not, we sense, against her wishes, JACK
     kisses CLARA softly, tenderly, deeply until she is moving
     against his tongue, using her sex like a mouth to kiss him in
     return.

     They make love, breaking each of Clara's two remaining rules
     in turn. First: JACK puts her in a position she initially
     resists. Then: he kisses her.

     CLARA comes, not wanting to.

     Suddenly, preoccupied, JACK does not.


85   INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT                         85

     JACK is in bed with CLARA.

                          CLARA
               Morboso?

     She looks at him.

                         CLARA
                   (with certainty)
               Morboso.

                          JACK
               Morboso?

                         CLARA
               Morboso is like... when you can't
               stop thinking about something.

     He stares back at her: wordless.

                         CLARA
               Or someone.

     A long pause: her eyes searching his. JACK sits up, lights a
     cigarette and stands by the window, looking through the
     blind, down into the street.

                         JACK
               You needn't act.

                          CLARA
               Act?
                                                      57.


     CLARA watches him, confused but fascinated.

                         JACK
               You might have to act with your
               other clients but you don't have to
               pretend anything at all with me.

     She lights herself a cigarette.

                         JACK
               I want you to be yourself with me.
               Be as indifferent as you like. I
               came here to get pleasure, not to
               give it.

     He hands her CASH.

     She counts it.

                         CLARA
               Maybe I pretend very well. I got
               more tip than the other girls
               usually get.

     He walks to the door.

     Pauses.

                         JACK
               I don't sleep with the other girls.

     And leaves.



86   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                86

     JACK is asleep.

     He is not alone.

     In the bed beside him:

                               INGRID.

     Pale as death.

     Eyes rolled back in her sockets.

                               ***

     JACK wakes up suddenly, gasping.

     The bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp.
                                                             58.


87   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAWN                                   87

     SUNRISE...

     ...over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in
     all Italy.


88   INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN                                        88

     In the gun-metal light of dawn, fiddly work:

       -cartridges taken apart

       -tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm

       -the hole half-filled with mercury

       -and plugged with a drop of liquid lead.

     JACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE
     BULLETS.


89   INT. CHURCH- DAY                                              89

     Outside, the sun is merciless. Inside, JACK has taken refuge
     in the cool of the church. He is alone. He is not praying.
     Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the
     thorns and the nails and the running blood.

     Footsteps. JACK checks for reflections in his watch.

     It's FATHER BENEDETTO: dressed for Mass.

                            FATHER BENEDETTO
                  I've been looking for you.

     He mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane,
     takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side, away from
     the light of the candles.

                             FATHER BENEDETTO
                  A man was here asking questions
                  about you.

     A beat.

                            JACK
                  Here?

                             FATHER BENEDETTO
                  He came to the church this
                  afternoon.

                            JACK
                  What did he want?
                                                     59.


                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          To know where you live. He said he
          was a friend from Switzerland.

                    JACK
          Switzerland?

JACK thinks.

                    JACK
          And you told him?

The priest looks at with complete disdain:

                     FATHER BENEDETTO
          Of course I do not tell him. How do
          I know him? He is maybe the police.
          Certainly he is no friend. A friend
          would know your pensione.
          Besides...

FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers:

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Friends do not carry guns.

FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searching
into him.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          If you live in Italy, and you are a
          man of the cloth, you meet many
          people. Besides, I lived once in
          Naples. If you live in Naples you
          know the difference between a fat
          wallet and a... custodia per armi
          di spalla. How you say in English?

                    JACK
          Shoulder holster.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Si.

JACK glances up and down the aisle.

OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes.

The BELL for mass starts ringing.

                    JACK
          You're a true friend, father.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          I am a priest.

JACK turns to go.
                                                          60.


                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               Signor Clarke?

     Again the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow in a
     gesture of austere confidence.

                         FATHER BENEDETTO
               I make a mistake. He did not say he
               was from La Svizzera: Switzerland.
               He said- forgive me the names in
               Italian are so similar- La Svezia:
               Sweden.


90   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- DAY                                      90

     THREE BELLS are ringing in the tower. Beneath them, a row of
     mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons, griffins, dogs and devils) look
     down over the little town, their faces frightening or
     frightened.

     JACK is among the gargoyles, leaning over parapet, his eyes
     made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars, surveying the town
     below, checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the
     YOUNG MAN.

     Nothing. Then he notices:

     Parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far
     from the main square. An AUDI...

     ...with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market
     sitting at the wheel.


91   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- NIGHT                        91

     The YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop.

     This is the first time we've seen him up close. In his early
     thirties, he's wearing a dark brown leather jacket and
     expensive jeans. His blonde hair is cropped short, and
     there's the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just
     beneath the collar of his shirt.

     The YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft
     movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco)
     and inserts the it between his top lip and gum.

     It is a strangely sinister act.

     Then he blends in with the tourists, milling down the Corso
     and round the square heading towards...
                                                           61.


92   INT. BAR- NIGHT                                              92

     JACK is sitting in the window, making himself as visible as
     possible to the world outside.

     He downs a Grappa: then gets up to pay for it. His movements
     are slow and leisurely.

     The BARMAN hands him his change. And a small white ENVELOPE.

     JACK is not expecting this.

                         BARMAN
                   (in ITALIAN)
               Someone left this for
               "L'Americano". This afternoon.

     JACK looks at the ENVELOPE.

                         JACK
               Grazie.

     He turns casually away from the BARMAN's prying eyes and
     opens the envelope with extreme caution.

     Inside is a folded CUTTING. It's from the Swedish Daily
     newspaper ÖSTERSUNDS-POSTEN.

     JACK unfolds the cutting. We catch a glimpse of:

     -Ingrid's dacha.

     -A police line.

     -Three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl.

     Heart racing, JACK slips the cutting in his pocket.

     Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar.

     And leaves.


93   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- NIGHT                    93

     The YOUNG MAN is watching a PUPPET SHOW in the middle of the
     square. The PUPPETEER is using glove puppets and the Punch
     and Judy style performance involves Punch fucking Judy with a
     grotesquely carved, outsize sex organ. There is a large crowd
     gathered.

     JACK leaves the bar, turning left and walking purposefully
     down the street.

     The YOUNG MAN follows.
                                                           62.


94   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                94

     It's a hot summer night and there are more tourists than
     usual.

     The YOUNG MAN uses them as cover.

     JACK turns down a dark, deserted alleyway.

     The YOUNG MAN hesitates.

     His right hand moves casually to his jacket pocket.

     And he follows.


95   EXT. ALLEYWAY- NIGHT                                         95

     We're with the YOUNG MAN as he stalks his prey through the
     mediaeval maze of streets...

     We end up in the narrow alleyway that JACK photographed on
     his first day in town.

     Up ahead, disappearing round a distant bend, we catch a
     glimpse of JACK, his heels CLACKING on the cobbles.

     The YOUNG MAN follows swiftly, his trainers silent. He gets
     to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS- all identical-
     converge. The YOUNG MAN is unsure which alleyway to take.

     The streets are empty.

     He listens.

     From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late
     night film on television. It's a romantic film, the violins
     muffled and sad with longing.

     From another alleyway comes the sound of SAVAGE BARKING. The
     YOUNG MAN looks around for the source of the barking, but the
     streets are empty.

     Suddenly, the barking stops.

     The YOUNG MAN looks confused.

     From his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable
     CLICK of a cocking mechanism.


96   EXT. COURTYARD- NIGHT                                        96

     We're recognise the secret courtyard: the one reached by
     means of the hidden archway.

     With one hand, JACK feeds another SUGAR CUBE to the MONGREL.
                                                             63.


     With the other hand, he holds his WALTHER behind his back...

     ...and cocks it.


97   EXT. ALLEYWAY- NIGHT                                          97

     The YOUNG MAN is waiting at the far end of the alleyway,
     hugging the wall, scanning the CROSSROADS ahead, unsure which
     of the four possible alleyways holds his prey.

     JACK emerges from the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and walks quickly up
     behind him.

     JACK has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent.

     He has thirty metres to cover. The gun hangs heavy in his
     right hand. It's fitted with a TAC 65 SOUND SUPPRESSOR. He
     raises his right hand.

     Twenty metres.

     The gun is pointing at the YOUNG MAN.

     Fifteen metres.

     His finger takes up the slack of the trigger.

     Ten meters.

     Then:

     A DUCATI turns into the alleyway behind JACK, its headlights
     on full beam.

     JACK drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced WALTHER
     deep into his jacket pocket.

     The YOUNG MAN looks his way.

     JACK is outlined by the moped's beam of light.

     The two men are face to face, within spitting distance.

     The DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN.

     The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET.

     The YOUNG MAN's eyes widen with fear.

     BANG!

     The DUCATI misfires.

     Mistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls
     and fires back.

     We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP!
                                                           64.


      The BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and
      lodges in the REAR COWLING.

      The MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes, hitting a stone
      staircase.

      JACK looks around.

      The YOUNG MAN has disappeared.

      The MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold.

      The front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly, squeaking.

      CHOOP!

      A bullet hits the road not far from JACK.

      CHOOP!

      Another bullet hits the wall behind him.

      Swiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI...


98    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE,    MEDIAVEVAL MAZE- NIGHT             98

      JACK rides the classic DUCATI, turning left and right without
      hesitation, through archways, down steps, dropping level by
      level, cursing in time with his jagged breathing until...


99    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- NIGHT              99

      JACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on
      the winding road.

      Silence. All we can hear are the crickets.

      Then the sound of a car.

      An AUDI tears past us, following JACK out of town.


100   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                    100

      JACK is heading for the mountains. He takes the first corner
      at 70 MPH.

      The AUDI gleams black in the moonlight. Gaining on him.


101   EXT. ANOTHER ANGLE- NIGHT                                  101

      JACK takes the next bend at top speed, his classic 1970
      1000cc engine howling.

      The AUDI slows, then powers through the bend, accelerating.
                                                           65.


102   INT. AUDI- NIGHT                                            102

      The YOUNG MAN puts his foot down.

      The SPEEDOMETER climbs.


103   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                     103

      The AUDI comes up swiftly behind Jack's DUCATI and tries to
      ram him.

      JACK dodges the AUDI, swerving from one side of the road to
      another.


104   EXT. VIADUCT- NIGHT                                         104

      A soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley.

      The AUDI overtakes the DUCATI, then swerves left, trying to
      crush JACK against the concrete barrier that masks a three
      hundred and fifty foot fall.

      JACK breaks hard and the AUDI misses him, smashing into the
      concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching
      metal.

      The AUDI follows the DUCATI into...


105   EXT. ALPINE TUNNEL- NIGHT                                   105

      Long, dark, neon-lit... and blind curved.

      The AUDI comes up fast behind the DUCATI.

      Jack swerves the DUCATI onto the other side of the road.

      The AUDI swerves left and tries to crush JACK into the left-
      hand wall of the tunnel.

      Suddenly, a CAR comes round the bend.

      What happens next happens fast:

      JACK swerves left and skids into a SERVICE LAY-BY, narrowly
      avoiding the CAR.

      The lay-by is small and JACK has to slide the DUCATI on it's
      side as he crashes it into the box-like space.

      The lay-by is too small for the AUDI.

      The AUDI and oncoming CAR collide.

      The AUDI's crumple zones buckle as both vehicles' bonnets
      concertina like a road safety test.
                                                           66.


      The AUDI has air bags. The oncoming CAR does not.

      On impact, its DRIVER goes through the windscreen of his own
      car and onwards, through the windscreen of the AUDI.

      The wreckage is awesome.

      Deep within the mangled metal of the two cars...

      ...the YOUNG MAN groans and twitches.

      JACK appears at the crumpled window of the AUDI.

      He reaches through the broken window, grabs the YOUNG MAN by
      the head...

      ...and breaks his neck.


106   EXT. WOODS- DAWN                                            106

      JACK washes away the worst of the dirt and the blood in a
      MOUNTAIN STREAM.


107   EXT. ROAD- DAY                                              107

      JACK on the DUCATI.

      Turns off at a sign for L'AQUILA.


108   EXT. L'AQUILA- MORNING                                      108

      L'AQUILA is the nearest and largest town in the region. It's
      also the location of the Via Lampedusa brothel.

      JACK comes out of a pharmacy and quite literally bumps into
      CLARA.

      He winces with pain.

                          CLARA
                Buon giorno!

                          JACK
                Buon giorno.

                          CLARA
                You are hurt?

                             JACK
                I'm fine.

                          CLARA
                What's wrong with you?
                                                           67.


                             JACK
                   It's nothing really. Just a broken
                   rib. Un costollo rotta?

                             CLARA
                   Stronzo! Let me help you!

                             JACK
                   I came off my bike.

                             CLARA
                   But you have to go to the hospital!

                             JACK
                   No, no, no. I have pain killers. I
                   just need a strong cup of coffee.

                             CLARA
                   I know a place which make the
                   strongest coffee in L'Aquila.

      Her limpid brown eyes twinkle.


109   INT. CLARA'S APARTMENT- DAY                                109

      A small, simply furnished bedroom with a bed, a desk and a
      chair.

      As he sips a large cup of strong black coffee, CLARA cleans a
      vicious welt on his right shoulder blade.

      As the dirt and blood come away she reveals an exquisite
      tattoo...

      ...of a BUTTERFLY.

                             CLARA
                   Ve bene. Tutto posto. Signor
                   Farfalla. [Good. Everything's OK.
                   Mr. Butterfly.]

      His eyes open wide and he turns to her quickly.

                             JACK
                   Why d'you call me that?

      A beat.

                             CLARA
                   You have a tattoo. On your back.

      Of course.

      He relaxes.

      But not completely.
                                                              68.


110   EXT. CASTELVECCHIO- DAY                                       110

      The situation at the beginning of the movie is perfectly
      reversed.

      From the relative safety of CASTELVECCHIO, JACK watches
      CASTEL DEL MONTE through binoculars:

      -The Phone Box.

      -The Bar.

      -The pensione D'Abruzzo.

      No sign of the police. No sign of any Shadow Dwellers.


111   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- SUNSET                    111

      JACK is in his usual phone box. His manner is quietly
      purposeful.

                            JACK
                  How did he know I was here, Larry?

                            LARRY (V.O.)
                  You think I hired him?

      A beat.

                            LARRY (V.O.)
                  Are you out of your fucking mind,
                  Jack?

                            JACK
                  I doubt it.

                            LARRY (V.O.)
                  After everything I've done for you?
                  The car, the cell phone (which you
                  threw away), the safehouse, the
                  fake passport? Someone has to pay
                  for this shit, Jack! I have to pay
                  for this shit. It comes out of my
                  commission. You're my lousy profit
                  margin. Why the fuck would I take a
                  contract out on my own profit
                  margin? You're not thinking
                  straight. I was the one who told
                  you to leave town! I told you to
                  come to Rome! God damn it you've
                  got a job to do! Why the Hell would
                  I...

      WHAM!

      Something smacks into the phone box at high speed.
                                                             69.


      JACK drops to his knees and reaches for his WALTHER.

      Outside the phone box three TEENAGERS are kicking a FOOTBALL
      around.


112   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                      112

      TINS of fruit drops: three kinds: black cherry, pineapple and
      lemon. Each tin is emptied of its fruit drops.

      Twenty rounds of ammunition- each round packed in silica- fit
      exactly into each tin.

      Lead rounds in the black cherry, jacketed in the pineapple
      and explosive in the lemon.

      JACK re-seals each tin with sellotape.


113   EXT. L'AQUILA, CORSO FREDERICO II - DAY                      113

      The colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded
      with window shoppers, tourists taking coffee, old men
      discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and
      chattering like songbirds.

      JACK is in dark glasses. He's sitting in a coffee shop under
      the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il
      Messagiero.

      C.U. we see he's studying a small column concerning the
      murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of Chieti.

      JACK spots CLARA walking along the corso. She's with a girl
      he has not seen before. ANNA. ANNA is small town girl with a
      keen sense of fashion. She and CLARA are hand in hand.

      CLARA sees JACK and speaks to her friend.

      They cross through the throng of boulevardiers.

                          CLARA
                My friend Anna. This is my friend
                Signor Farfalla.

      CLARA's eyes twinkle mischievously.

      The girls cease to hold hands and ANNA offers hers to JACK.
      JACK half rises like the perfect gentlemen, folding his
      newspaper and accepting ANNA's greeting.

                          JACK
                How do you do?

                          ANNA
                I am very well thank you.
                                                      70.


Ah. This is to be an impromptu English lesson. JACK
acquiesces gracefully.

                    JACK
          Will you take a coffee with me?

                    CLARA
          That would be very good.

He indicates two empty chairs.

                      JACK
          Prego.

CLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK. Under the table,
her knee presses against his.

ANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive is
to move it out of the sun. She is not flirting.

                    CLARA
          Anna is learning English.

                    JACK
          Have you been to England?

ANNA seems momentarily confused.

                    ANNA
          But you are...

She looks at CLARA.

                    ANNA
          Lui Americano?

                      JACK
          I am.

JACK glances at CLARA.

How much has she told her friend?

                    ANNA
          Ah. I have not been to England only
          to France. But I would love to go
          to America.

The WAITER comes over.

                    JACK
          Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.

                    CLARA
          Anna is like all Italians. She
          thinks America is like in the
          movies. Little Italy, "West Side
          Story", "Chicago".
                    (MORE)
                                                           71.

                          CLARA (cont'd)
                I tell her in these times America
                is like here, there, anywhere. The
                streets are not... pave-ed with
                gold.

      She beams happily at JACK. He smiles back at her.

                          JACK
                If not with gold, than at least not
                with enough medieval cobbles to
                loosen every-self tapping screw in
                a Fiat.

      JACK beams. Neither girl understands. But everyone smiles
      happily.

      The WAITER brings the coffee and CLARA insists on paying.

                          JACK
                Where do you come from, Anna?

      ANNA frowns. JACK plays teacher.

                          JACK
                Dove abita?

                          ANNA
                Ah, yes! I live in Via dell'
                Argilla. Nearby to Clara.

      JACK briefly wonders what else he could teach her. He scans
      both girls and decides CLARA is the prettier. CLARA seems to
      sense this. She smiles to herself.

      JACK is touched.


114   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO II, L'AQUILA- DAY                      114

      We cut wide and watch JACK talk inconsequentialities with the
      girls. They stand to go. JACK rises.

                          CLARA
                Perhaps we will have a drink
                together soon? I am free...

      Her words sound rehearsed. She considers a crowded timetable.

                          CLARA
                ...on Monday.

                          JACK
                Great. I'll see you then.

                          CLARA
                But Eduardo... Where would you like
                to meet?
                                                     72.


Again: rehearsed. JACK is not expecting this. CLARA looks at
him mischievously. ANNA is listening.

                    JACK
          How about our usual place?

                    CLARA
          Our usual place?

She feigns complete perplexity.

                    CLARA
          I forgot. Where is our usual place?

                    JACK
          You've forgotten?

                       CLARA
          Remind me.

The twinkle in her eye. She's testing him. JACK is the
perfect gentleman.

                     JACK
          Maybe we should try something
          different.

                    CLARA
          Where would you like to try,
          Eduardo?

A beat. JACK spots a restaurant on the opposite side of the
road.

                    JACK
          Locanda Grapelli?

There is no warmth in his suggestion. But CLARA doesn't care.

                    CLARA
          Locanda Grapelli! Si!

She looks genuinely delighted.

                    ANNA
          This is the best food in the area.

                       JACK
          Good.

                       CLARA
          Seven?

                       JACK
          Seven.

                    CLARA
          Locanda Grapelli.
                                                           73.


                          JACK
                Locanda Grapelli.

                          CLARA
                You'll be there?

                          JACK
                I'll be there.

                          CLARA
                See you then, Eduardo.

                          JACK
                See you then, Clara. It was a
                delight to meet you Anna.
                Arrivederci.

                          ANNA
                Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.

      There is an unmistakable twinkle in ANNA's eye. How much she
      knows is uncertain. She kisses him swiftly and softly on the
      cheek.

      CLARA does the same on the lips. Behind the mischief in her
      eyes is something doubtful. Has she gone too far?


115   EXT. DOWNTOWN L'AQUILA- DAY                                115

      JACK visits three stores:

      -In a PHOTOGRAPHIC SHOP he buys half a dozen FILM PROTECTION
      BAGS.

      -In a HABERDASHERS he purchases several packets of HOOKS and
      EYES like the kind you find on brassieres.

      -In a OFFICE SUPPLY SHOP he buys some custom made headed
      notepaper, invoice books, notepads, envelopes, metal pens, a
      calculator and a mobile phone.


116   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    116

      JACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and
      lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film
      protection bags, cut to fit.

      Into the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of
      firm grey plastic foam. These form the pockets into which he
      slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.
      They fit perfectly.

      Over this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false
      bottom: a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom
      made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads and envelopes.
                                                           74.


      To the briefcase's central divider he adds the metal pens, a
      calculator and a mobile phone. He sets the combination to
      821. Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE.

      This done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. With his
      work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness.


117   EXT. PARCO DELLA RESISTENZA - JUST BEFORE DAWN              117

      A small park not far from Castel Del Monte's town square.

      It is just after dawn. The pine trees and the poplars are
      silent. The sun is not yet up but the day is light. Sparrows
      hop about, searching for crumbs.

      JACK, ravaged by lack of sleep, wonders about like the demon
      of a lost darkness, looking for his hole down to the
      underworld.

                          FATHER BENEDETTO
                Buon giorno!

      He's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half-welcome,
      half-benediction.

      They greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into slow
      step with JACK. The priest walks with his hands behind his
      back. JACK with his hands in his pockets.

                          FATHER BENEDETTO
                I walk here to meditate. Once a
                week, Wednesday, the farthest one
                can travel in the week from the
                Sabbath. The trees are like the
                Stations of the Cross: by certain
                trees I thank God for certain
                favours he has granted me, or
                certain gifts he has made to me and
                all men. For example, here by this
                pine, I thank him for the many
                friendships I have and ask him to
                look after those of my friends who
                are troubled.

      They reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his head
      in prayer. After a while he says:

                          FATHER BENEDETTO
                Some walk here in the cool of
                evening. Others come at night.

      There is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself:

                          FATHER BENEDETTO
                I wonder how many bastards have
                been made here?
                                                75.


He gives a small sideways glance at JACK.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Perhaps you'll stay and settle here
          yourself?

                    JACK
          What makes you think I'm leaving?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          You told me as much when we first
          met. Besides, those who seek for
          peace seldom find it. They're
          always moving on, looking
          elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are
          usually sinners.

                    JACK
          All men are sinners.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Some are greater sinners than
          others. And those who seek peace
          have much sinning in their history.

                    JACK
          I don't seek peace. I never have.

                       FATHER BENEDETTO
          Until now.

                     JACK
          Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The
          valley. The villages. The
          mountains.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Forgive me. This is the priest in
          me speaking. And the friend. But
          you have done much sinning, Signor
          Clarke. You still do.

                    JACK
          I see a whore. She's young enough
          to be my daughter.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          I do not refer to the sins of
          carnality. But to the deadly
          sins...

                    JACK
          Aren't all sins equal?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          We are not discussing theology, my
          friend, but you. You like this
          town, this valley.
                    (MORE)
                                                     76.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO (cont'd)
          You should like to remain here and
          find your peace at last. Yet you
          cannot. There is something you
          cannot ignore. Some force. Some
          enemy.

JACK is silent.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          You want to speak but you dare not.
          You know no one sufficiently well
          to share your history with them.
          You know I am trustworthy yet still
          you are cautious.

FATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and face
him.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          What job do you do, Signor? Are you
          on the run, as they say?

                      JACK
          Who says?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          It's an expression, no?

                     JACK
          Everyone's on the run from
          something.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Some men watch some of the shadows.
          You watch them all.

                    JACK
          I've done nothing I didn't have
          good cause to do.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Do you wish to tell me?

                    JACK
          For what reason?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          For your own sake. Perhaps I can
          pray for you?

A change of pace.

                    JACK
          I make things. Artifacts.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Counterfeit money?
                                                     77.


                    JACK
          Why do you say that?

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          You work in metal. You are given
          some steel by Fabio, the car
          doctor.

                    JACK
          You know a lot about me.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          I know only what you do in the
          town. People talk to me. I am their
          priest and they trust me.

                    JACK
          And I should too?

                       FATHER BENEDETTO
          Of course.

They stare at one another.

JACK wants to confess. He does not know why.

But he doesn't. He does something we're not expecting:

                    JACK
          Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he
          conceived here father?

FATHER BENEDETTO is motionless.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Why do you ask me that?

                    JACK
          He looks like you. Even more than
          he does in the photos you keep of
          each other. Where was he conceived,
          father? Under one of these trees?
          At night? Like all the other
          bastards?

There is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares up
at JACK with extraordinary intensity.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          I do not remember, Signor. It was
          twenty-five years ago.

FATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind makes
dust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak
again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees.
                                                           78.


                           FATHER BENEDETTO
                 In the end it is I who confesses to
                 you.

                           JACK
                 Expecting me to reciprocate?

                           FATHER BENEDETTO
                 Perhaps. For your own good. You
                 cannot doubt the existence of Hell.
                 You live in it. It is a place
                 without love. As for me, I go about
                 my daily duties because the town
                 requires it of me. Some know what
                 you know. Perhaps I have no right
                 to wear these robes. But I do have
                 a heart full of a father's love.
                 Something close to His heart! And
                 for that I am both grateful and
                 happy.

      On JACK.

                           FATHER BENEDETTO
                 What do you have, my friend?

      Another gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's face.

      The assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its from
      the dust.


118   INT. JACK'S ROOM- EVENING                                  118

      JACK dresses very carefully for dinner.

      It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon
      CLARA.


119   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPELLI- NIGHT                               119

      Stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda
      that overlooks the town. Overhead a canopy of vine and
      jasmine. Above that a sky full of stars.

      Of the thirty or so candle-lit tables that dot the veranda,
      more than half are occupied by romantic couples.

      JACK scans the tables and checks his watch. It's shortly
      after seven pm and there's no sign of CLARA.

      He waits. Then turns to leave.

                           CLARA (O.S.)
                 Ciao.
                                                              79.


      She kisses him once on the lips. She's hot and flustered.
      She's been rushing.

                          CLARA
                I did not think you would come.

                          JACK
                I wasn't sure you meant me to.

      CLARA looks doubtful. It's the same look she gave him at the
      cafe. She is breaking the golden rule of prostitution.
      Getting involved. Her heart is pulling one way and her head
      another.

                             CLARA
                Certo.

      A WAITER approaches.

                             WAITER
                Per due?

      Judging by his disapproving tone, the WAITER seems to know
      what CLARA does for a living. CLARA senses this immediately.

                             CLARA
                Si.


120   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPPELLI- NIGHT                                 120

      CLARA and JACK sit at a table overlooking the town.

      The WAITER lights their candle and deposits two menus
      peremptorily.

                          CLARA
                Una botiglia di acqua minerale non
                gasata et... una Parasini, per
                favore.

      Completely ignoring her, the WAITER addresses JACK with a
      wink.

                          WAITER
                Menu in Inglese?

      A beat.

                          JACK
                No, grazie.

                          WAITER
                Tedesco? Olandese?

                          CLARA
                    (to the WAITER)
                He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen:
                                                        80.


She repeats her order, articulating each word emphatically,
like a teacher to a slow school child:

                    CLARA
          Una botiglia di acqua minerale et
          una Parasini, per favore.

She isn't upset. It's just her way of letting both men know
that she's in charge.

The WAITER turns to her, deferring to her strength of
character.

                    WAITER
          Gasata?

                    CLARA
          Non gasata.

He nods with some genuine deference and leaves.

CLARA sighs.

                     CLARA
              (mostly to herself)
          Cittadina.

                    JACK
          Small towns.

JACK smiles. CLARA smiles back. They have this contempt in
common.

The WAITER reappears and pours a thumbful of wine. It is pale
red in colour and frizzante. At CLARA's insistence, JACK
tastes it. It is dry and has a tar-like aftertaste.

                    CLARA
          Parasini. From Calabria. It is
          good, you will agree?

                    JACK
          It is. Very good.

He looks at her and- for a brief moment- he undergoes what is
a unique experience for him: a positive longing to repeat
this brief moment many times in the future.

CLARA catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms.

                    CLARA
          Can I ask you something, Eduardo?

                    JACK
          Sure.

                    CLARA
          You are married?
                                                     81.


                    JACK
          No.

A beat.

                    JACK
          I doubt any of the couples here
          are. With the exception of the
          Germans at table seven. She's
          wearing a wedding ring and they
          haven't spoken a word to each other
          for eight and half minutes.

                    CLARA
          I was sure this was your secret.

                    JACK
          What makes you think I have a
          secret? I'm an ordinary man. I
          cough. I fart. I earn a living.

JACK observes a GYPSY selling roses.

                    CLARA
          I do not think you are an ordinary
          man. I think you are a good man.
          But you have a secret.

The GYPSY approaches, offering CLARA a ROSE. She refuses
firmly.

                    CLARA
          He thinks we are a couple.

JACK signals to the GYPSY and buys CLARA a ROSE.

                    JACK
          Why spoil the illusion?

She looks at him and smiles.

                    CLARA
              (in ITALIAN)
          As long as we know it is an
          illusion.

Her smile is only a little bit sad.

Still, JACK doesn't know what to say.

They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER.

                    WAITER
          Buona sera. Desidera?

CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his
ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and
moves.
                                                             82.


121   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                                  121

      JACK   and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth.
      They   look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his.
      They   say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging
      with   other couples.


122   EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT                                       122

      The coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO
      are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK
      is the oldest person there.

      The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small
      silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In
      front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae.
      CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl. She's a bit
      drunk.

                               CLARA
                  Woooow!

      She eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her
      pleasure.

                               JACK
                  How is it?

                               CLARA
                  Bitchin'.

                            JACK
                      (amused)
                  Bitchin'?

                            CLARA
                  It's- come se dice- `slang', no?
                  Eco.

      She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce
      and holds it out to JACK.

                               JACK
                  No thanks.

                            CLARA
                  Come on, Eduardo!

      He hesitates. He eats.

                            CLARA
                  It is good, you will agree?

                            JACK
                      (his mouth full)
                  I will agree.
                                                       83.


                    CLARA
              (sensing his teasing)
          My English is nice!

                    JACK
          It's bitchin'.

                    CLARA
              (defending herself)
          You know how to swear in Italian?

                    JACK
          Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.

                    CLARA
          "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia
          merde e morte: tuo cazzo un
          brufolo.

                    JACK
          Eat shit and die, pimple dick?

CLARA hiccups.

                      CLARA
          Perdone!

                    JACK
          I guess I've led a sheltered life.
          Of sorts.

                    CLARA
          Shell-tered?

                    JACK
          Too much work.

CLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but the
screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of her
handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone.

                    CLARA
          Too much work.

She turns the phone to silent. And looks up at JACK.

                    CLARA
          I don't apologise, Eduardo.

                      JACK
          For what?

                    CLARA
          For this I do. My job.

                    JACK
          Never apologise.
                                                84.


He means it.

A beat.

                    CLARA
          Except this job is full of testa di
          cazzo.

                      JACK
          Mine too.

                      CLARA
          Lei?

                      JACK
          Si.

                    CLARA
          But you are too young to...
          pensione?

                      JACK
          Retire.

                      CLARA
          Si.

                      JACK
          Liar.

                      CLARA
          No!

                    JACK
          Would you be flattering me if I
          wasn't a client?

He's put CLARA on the spot.

                    JACK
          Am I a client?

CLARA takes a deep breath.

                    CLARA
          This say yes.

She points at her head.

                      CLARA
          This...

She points at her heart.

                    CLARA
          This cannot be for sale. But I am
          not want to... come se dice?
                                                           85.


                           JACK
                 Give it away.

      She looks at him.

      JACK studies her, searching for his own feelings.

                           CLARA
                 Stronzo! I buy you a present!

      She fishes about in her handbag...

      ...and produces a SILVER BOX.

      JACK unwraps the shiny paper. Inside is a plastic case like
      the sort you put engagement rings in. Inside the case is a
      BADGE, hand-painted, depicting the symbol of the region: the
      eagle of L'Aquila. JACK sticks the BADGE in his lapel.

                             JACK
                 Grazie.

      An embarrassed beat.

      CLARA kisses him.

                           JACK
                 Grazie, Clara.

                           CLARA
                 Prego. Eduardo.

      A pause.

                           CLARA
                 My apartment is not far from here.


123   INT. CLARA'S APARTMENT- MORNING                            123

      JACK opens his eyes.

      Sits up.

      He's shocked to have slept so deeply.

      CLARA must be in the shower.

      He looks around at the little room casually, like a curious
      lover.

      Opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet.

      Finds a VIBRATOR.

      Opens the bottom drawer.

      Finds a RED PURSE.
                                                             86.


      Inside the RED PURSE...

      Finds a BERETTA DOUBLE-ACTION MODEL 21A BOBCAT.

      Just at that moment CLARA comes out of the bathroom.

      JACK shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep.


124   EXT.PAY PHONE- DAY                                           124

      JACK has driven to the remotest phone box he can find: not
      far from the entrance to one of the region's four national
      parks: beside a lake, below a mountain range and approached
      by a long, straight, empty road.

      No one could possibly creep up on him here. Nevertheless, as
      he talks, JACK makes his habitual and continuous 360 scan of
      the area.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
                We're moving the drop.

                           JACK
                Where?

                          LARRY (V.O.)
                We don't know yet. I'll call you
                ten am on the day with a venue.
                Give you enough time to make the
                noon delivery.

                          JACK
                I don't deliver, Larry. I never
                deliver. It's too dangerous. She
                comes to me. I know the town.
                That's what we agreed.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
                I told `em. I told `em if there was
                even the slightest chance security
                had been breached, you'd have dealt
                with it immediately.

      A beat.

                          JACK
                Breach? What breach?

      For the first time in the movie we cut to LARRY at home:


125   INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY                            125

      LARRY is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a
      large, imperial mahogany desk. In front of him are two banks
      of screens.
                                                           87.


      The first bank displays 3 CCTV views: (1) the entrance to his
      apartment block (2) a staircase and (3) the entrance to his
      apartment itself.

      Another bank of screens shows 3 NEWS CHANNELS: (1) CNN, (2)
      BBC WORLD and (3) AL JAZEERA.

                          LARRY
                Our pretty young Belgian client and
                her associates think someone on
                your long list of enemies might
                have put a tail on you.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                Not possible.

                          LARRY
                Course not, Jack. But if, for the
                sake of argument, it was possible-
                I'm thinking it could be Galazzo.
                Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover.

                           JACK (V.O.)
                Cops?

                          LARRY
                The crooked kind.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                How come I'm still here?

                          LARRY
                The Belgians think they're planning
                to wait for the drop and
                exterminate you and Mathilde in one
                swoop.

      With the help of his DESKTOP computer LARRY is comparing the
      scrolling share prices on CNN with the fluctuating value of
      the US DOLLAR.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                Where the hell's this information
                coming from?

                          LARRY
                I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you
                want my opinion, they're just being
                jittery. I told `em you were the
                most security conscious
                professional I know. I told `em no
                one gets close to you.


126   EXT.PAY PHONE- DAY                                         126

                          JACK
                They don't.
                                                             88.


                           LARRY (V.O.)
                 I told `em if we couldn't trust you
                 to keep a tight lid on operations
                 the who could we trust?

                           JACK
                 They can. They can trust me and so
                 can you.

      JACK is tense. Every word is carefully enunciated:

                           JACK
                 I've never jeopardised an operation
                 in my life.

                           LARRY (V.O.)
                 You don't have to tell me that,
                 Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed
                 your own girlfriend's account...

      ECU on JACK.


127   INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY                            127

      The words are out before he can stop them.

                           LARRY
                 Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry.

      He rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity.

                           LARRY
                 That was, um.... I'm just saying
                 you can be relied on.

      Silence.

                            LARRY
                 Jack?

      CLICK.


128   EXT. PAY PHONE- DAY                                          128

      JACK has hung up.

      He is lost in fearful thought, jaw muscles grinding.


129   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- NIGHT                                     129

      Amongst the GARGOYLES...

      ...JACK, looking through his miniature binoculars.

      His POV:
                                                           89.


      Of CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick, tough YOUNG
      ITALIAN MAN in a suit.

      He is showing her photographs. Of what- we cannot see. CLARA
      looks very, very serious.

      The YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves. JACK watches him get into a
      smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN. Rome
      plates.

      When he looks back at the cafe, CLARA has gone.


130   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                     130

      JACK opens his PICNIC HAMPER and in it he puts:

      -a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
      chilled bottle of Aspirinio

      -a loaf of course bread

      -two clods of mozarella

      -150 gms of proscuitto

      -and his WALTHER PPK/S.


131   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY                                  131

      CLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to
      the Parco della Resistanza, sheltering in the shade of a
      tree.

      She is holding the RED PURSE. At her feet is blue plastic bag
      rounded out by a watermelon.

      JACK pulls his CAR into the curb.

                            CLARA
                  Ciao, Eduardo!

      She opens the passenger door, leans in and kisses JACK long
      and full on the lips.

                             JACK
                  Put them in the back. We've got a
                  way to go.

      She puts the plastic bag in the trunk.

      Inside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER.


132   INT. CAR-   DAY                                             132

      CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt.
                                                           90.


      She puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the
      RED PURSE.

      And drives.

                          CLARA
                Where we go?

                            JACK
                Swimming.

                          CLARA
                How far do we go? To Fanale?

                          JACK
                An hour. And we're not going to the
                sea, we're going to the lakes. In
                the mountains.

                          CLARA
                For a... come se dice... you have
                in the back...

                            JACK
                A picnic.

                          CLARA
                A pick-nick! We are going for a
                pick-nick. Just the two of us.

      She looks at him.

                          CLARA
                I have practise my English,
                Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick.
                It is a beautiful day, isn't it?

                            JACK
                It is.


133   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- DAY                                      133

      The CAR negotiates a familiar hairpin bend.


134   INT. CAR- DAY                                              134

      CLARA is station hopping.

      She finds some LOU REED. She loves LOUD REED.

      JACK is concentrating on the road.

                          CLARA
                Is it more far?
                                                           91.


                          JACK
                Ten kilometres. Another twenty
                minutes.

      She pauses to work out the mathematics. She's smart. And
      puzzled. But she's not frightened. Not yet.

                          CLARA
                Twelve kilometres? In twenty
                minutes?

                          JACK
                We're going off the beaten track.

      She looks confused.

                          JACK
                Lontano. Fuori mano.

      CLARA laughs.

                          CLARA
                You will speak Italian. One day, I
                will teach you.


135   EXT. ALPINE TRACK- DAY                                     135

      JACK turns off the main road and onto an alpine track.

      This is the same route he took with the Belgian woman.

      The CAR bumps and tilts on the rough terrain.


136   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                       136

      CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track.

                          CLARA
                Where are we going?

      Now she's anxious. This is not what she expected.

                          JACK
                You shall see.

                          CLARA
                I think it is good we should stay
                close to the road.

                          JACK
                There's no need to worry. I've been
                here before several times. Taking
                photographs.

      He swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the
      Citroen pitches as if struck by a wave.
                                                     92.


CLARA clings to the door with her right hand, her left hand
dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself.

                    JACK
          You're not afraid of coming into
          the wild with me, are you?

                      CLARA
          No!

She laughs tensely.

                    CLARA
          Of course I am not. Not with you.
          But this...

She snaps her fingers.

                    CLARA
          ...sentiero!

She waves her hand in the air.

                    CLARA
          You should have a jeep. A Toyota.
          It is not good for a... berlina.

It's as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her
English.

                    JACK
          This is a Citroen!

He strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand.

                    JACK
          This was made by the French for
          taking potatoes to market. Besides,
          I always come here in this car.

                      CLARA
          You sure?

                    JACK
          Of course. I don't want to walk
          back to town any more than you do.

                    CLARA
          I think you are crazy. This will go
          to nowhere.

                    JACK
          I assure you it does.

She pouts her reply. The TRACK disappears into a WOOD and
runs out altogether, giving way to grass.
                                                     93.


                    CLARA
          Now there is no road!

JACK stops the car and turns the engines off.

Sudden silence.

CLARA lets go of the seat.

                    CLARA
          Is this where we go?

They are surrounded by trees.

                    JACK
          No. Not quite. We go another
          hundred metres, through the wood.
          But from here we just roll forward.
          No motor. No sound. And you'll see
          a wonder.

She grips the seat again.

                    JACK
          You won't need to hold on. I'll go
          slowly. Just relax and look.

He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move
forward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres JACK
twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes.
They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and
come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT
TREE.

Beyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET.
The hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and
blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the
edge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post.

CLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. He
watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through
his miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA turns
towards him, the binoculars are hidden.

                    CLARA
          No one comes here?

She speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her.

                      JACK
          No.

                      CLARA
          Just you.

                      JACK
          Yes.
                                                     94.


CLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the
grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows
and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut.
She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and
unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps
daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK.

JACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward
without meaning to.

                    CLARA
          Well?

She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side.

                    CLARA
          I am going to swim in the lake. Are
          you coming?

She doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through
the grass towards the water.

                    JACK
          There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!

                    CLARA
          Maybe! But I am lucky!

The HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly
flapping.

                    CLARA
              (shouting)
          He is an Italian bird! We disturb
          his siesta!

Quickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN.

The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen.

                    CLARA
          Come, Signor Farfalla!

JACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for
time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED
PURSE.

We can see it wedged under the passenger seat.

Due to the design of the car, JACK cannot.

                    CLARA
          Come!

JACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the
caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he
reaches the water's edge.
                                                     95.


CLARA is standing in the middle.

                    CLARA
          Stand by me.

He obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his
hand under the water, holding it out in front of them.

JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed.
Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his
foot.

                    CLARA
          Keep still. Watch.

As the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY
FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They
hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move
in to nibble at the skin on their fingers.

                     JACK
          If we stay here for a year, they'll
          devour us.

                    CLARA
          It is said that if these fishes
          bite at two hands holding, then
          love is good for the people.

He looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in
his head.

She kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and
body as pure and warm as the water.

He tries helplessly to pull away.

                    JACK
          Maybe we should...

                    CLARA
          Do you make love in the water?

                       JACK
          I haven't.

She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from
the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She
tries to push herself onto him but he resists.

                    CLARA
          What's wrong?

He doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused,
searching.

                       JACK
          Let's eat.
                                                           96.


      He walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart
      around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds,
      travelling with the waves made by their departure.


137   EXT. LAKESIDE- DAY                                         137

      CLARA is lying naked on a blanket.

      Beside her is the RED PURSE.

      Through sleepy, half-closed eyes she is watching L'AMERICANO.

      From her POV, JACK is kneeling behind the open PICNIC HAMPER,
      unpacking the food and wine. The LID of the basket obscures
      his hands.

                           CLARA
                Eduardo.

      JACK looks at her.

                          CLARA
                Is this your real name?

      A beat.

                          JACK
                Is Clara yours?

                           CLARA
                Si. Yes.

      She looks at him. Waiting for his reply.

                          JACK
                Edward is my real name.

                           CLARA
                Ed-ward.

      She doesn't believe him.

                          CLARA
                You are sure you are not married,
                Eduardo?

                          JACK
                Quite sure.

      About this he's telling the truth.

      CLARA reaches for the RED PURSE.

      From behind the picnic hamper lid we hear the CLICK of a
      cocking mechanism.

      CLARA hesitates for a moment.
                                                     97.


JACK watches her intently.

She reaches into her purse.

JACK is expressionless.

When CLARA withdraws her right hand she is holding a tube of
SUNTAN LOTION.

A beat.

JACK watches as she commences smoothing it into her skin,
rubbing it around her breasts, pushing them aside, pressing
them upwards. Then she caresses the lotion into her belly and
down her thighs, bending at the waist as she works it into
her shins.

                    CLARA
          Will you put this on my back?

She proffers him the SUNTAN LOTION.

JACK stares at her baking body, transfixed by its terrible
and perfect beauty.

Hidden behind the LID of the picnic hamper...

...his trembling right hand grips tightly to his WALTHER.

A long pause.

                      CLARA
          Eduardo?

He's frozen.

                      CLARA
          Amore?

Time seems to stop.

ECU on JACK.

Suddenly, CLARA sits up.

                    CLARA
          Eduardo, what's wrong?

JACK swallows.

When he speaks his mouth his dry.

                      JACK
          Nothing.

When he moves towards her, he is holding nothing in his
hands.
                                                     98.


      He takes the tube of SUNTAN lotion.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                Dear Father Benedetto...

      And begins to run it into CLARA's back.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                I promised myself that I would
                write to you- as your friend- to
                say goodbye.


138   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                      138

      SLAM!

      JACK shuts the boot of the car.

      He scans the lakeside.

      No sign of the picnic.

      No sign of CLARA.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                Everything I've ever done...

      Then he spots something.

      On the ground, not far from the car.

      He walks over and picks it up.

      It's one of CLARA's shoes.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                I've done for a reason.

      JACK is staring at the SHOE.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                I never thought the day would come
                when I'd run out of reasons.
                Reasons to worry. Reasons to run.
                Reasons to pull the trigger.

      JACK turns and walks over to the car.

      CLARA is in the passenger seat.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                Maybe that day's come.

      JACK gets into the Citroen.
                                                     99.


                      JACK (V.O.)
           Or maybe I've just found a reason
           to change.

And hands CLARA her shoe.

                     CLARA
           Grazie, Eduardo.

                     JACK
           I still don't understand. What's
           the point of a gun if it's not
           loaded?

                     CLARA
           One of the girls borrow it to me
           after the second hooker in Chieti
           is murdered. With some of the
           clients it make me feel safe. I
           don't tell the police, of course,
           but... Madonna, Eduardo. How they
           do to these two women! A police
           agente from Rome show me
           photographs. They show photographs
           to everyone in Via Lampedusa.

CLARA shivers with disgust.

                     CLARA
           Non capito... how one person hurt
           another in this way.

JACK looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution.

                     JACK
           Does the gun make you feel safer
           with me?

                     CLARA
           You are not a client.

                     JACK
           Then why's it in your purse?

CLARA looks unhappy.

                     CLARA
           I have to work tonight, amore.

Silence.

JACK looks away.

                     JACK (V.O.)
           Maybe this is suicide. Cops often
           put the graft on working girls.
           Perhaps the girl I told you about,
           Clara, has sold me out.
                     (MORE)
                                                    100.

                    JACK (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe
          she's a hired gun. Then again,
          maybe Clara is who she says she is
          and my Belgian clients will take
          the gun, shoot me themselves and
          keep the money. Always a risk in my
          profession. Or perhaps my trusted
          colleague in Rome no longer trusts
          me. Perhaps even you, Father, with
          your connections in Naples...

                    CLARA
          What will you do?

                    JACK
          I guess I'll go to work too.

                    CLARA
          And after that? Tomorrow and the
          next day.

                    JACK
          I can't stay here forever.

As the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he
could.

                    JACK (V.O.)
          It's not that I've given up on
          life, Father. Just the way that I
          was living it. If you can call it
          living.

                    CLARA
          I want always to stay here.

                    JACK
          It's time to go home.

                    CLARA
          Let me come to your home.

                    JACK
          I can't, Clara. One day...

She's upset but decides not to press her demand.

                    JACK (V.O.)
          If I had one request, Father, it
          would be this. That it's not Clara
          who finally pulls the trigger. But
          whoever it is...

CLARA kisses him and simply says:

                    CLARA
          Stay forever here.
                                                          101.


                           JACK (V.O.)
                 ...by this time tomorrow I'll be
                 dead.

      Fade to black.




      FADE IN:


139   EXT/INT. CHURCH- DAY                                        139

      A POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO.

                           FATHER BENEDETTO
                 Ciao Fabio, come stai?

                           IL POSTINO
                 Bene grazie, Padre.

      We follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a
      bunch of church circulars. One LETTER catches his eye.

      He opens it and starts to read aloud:

                           FATHER BENEDETTO
                 Dear Father Benedetto. I promised
                 myself that I would write to you-
                 as your friend- to say goodbye...


140   INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN                                      140

      JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the
      black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand.

      He surveys his room. All evidence of his existence has been
      meticulously tidied away.

                           FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)
                 Everything I've ever done...

      JACK leaves.

      Only thing is left behind:

      The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE on the
      bedside table.

                           FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)
                 I've done for a reason.
                                                          102.


141   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                        141

      The sun is shining. The mountains young and sharp and
      beautiful. The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that
      spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel.


142   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                        142

      JACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks
      backwards and forwards.


143   EXT. SERVICE STATION- DAY                                   143

      JACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a
      forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps, a
      convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe.

      The car park is not large. JACK parks the Citroen facing the
      EXIT. There is a single bar across it but this is raised.

      JACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and
      slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket.

      Stepping out of the car he looks around the car park. It's
      only a quarter full and ominously quiet. Somewhere in the
      distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak...

      JACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away.
      He makes a show of locking the car but doesn't.

      As he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE. We see the
      source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a SIGN for engine
      oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze.


144   INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY                                   144

      Empty.

      JACK sits at a table at the back of the cafe. From here he
      can see both entrances: the public entrance and the service
      entrance and also the door to the bathrooms. Through the
      window, he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the
      slip road to and from the autostrada.

      JACK places the BRIEFCASE on a chair beside him and puts a
      PAPER BAG on the table next to the sugar dispenser. He checks
      his watch. It is two minutes before noon. He orders an
      espresso.

      His nerve-heightened senses take in everything: the sound of
      the cicadas, the buzz of the neon strip-lights and the creak,
      creak, creak of the engine oil sign outside, endlessly
      revolving.

      JACK's eyes flick outside to the forecourt.
                                                    103.


We hear the cafe door open.

And in an instant, MATHILDE is at his table.

She is dressed in a tight black skirt, a simple blue blouse
and a dark blue jacket. Her hair is neatly styled, her make-
up immaculate and heavier than we've seen her wear before.
She looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a
Samsonite briefcase.

                    MATHILDE
          Hello. I see you have brought it in
          from the car with you.

She speaks quietly: her voice low and attractive.

                    JACK
          All there, as agreed.

                    MATHILDE
          What's in the paper bag?

The WAITRESS comes over with Jack's coffee. MATHILDE orders
another for herself.

                    JACK
          Sweets. For your journey.

She opens the bag and takes out one of the TINS.

She can immediately feel that it's heavier than it should be.

                    JACK
          I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.

                    MATHILDE
          That is most thoughtful of you.

The polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight
Belgian accent.

The WAITRESS returns with the second espresso and MATHILDE
pays for them both.

JACK watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it. She's
nervous.

                    JACK
          I suppose I'll read about this in
          the Times or the International
          Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.

For a moment she is pensive.

                    MATHILDE
          Yes, I expect so.
                                                          104.


      She drinks her coffee, holding her cup in mid-air and looking
      out the window.

      JACK follows her eye-line to check she's not signalling to an
      accomplice.

      The FORECOURT is still empty.

      Creak, creak, creak, creak...

      MATHILDE looks at JACK. Her expression is impossible to read.
      Perhaps it's tinged with sadness. She drinks the rest of her
      coffee.

                          MATHILDE
                I'm just going to the ladies. Wait
                here.

      She picks up the CASE.

      There is nothing JACK can do about this. She has taken him
      off guard and grasped the initiative.

      All he can do is wait.


145   INT. AUTOSTRADA BATHROOM- CONTINUOUS                       145

      MATHILDE enters a cubicle, opens the CASE, bypasses the
      stationary, lifts the false bottom and checks the SOCIMI
      parts are present and correct.

      Then she loads a magazine.


146   INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY                                  146

      MATHILDE returns from the bathroom.

                          MATHILDE
                Shall we go.

      Not a question, a command.

      JACK is obliged to stand up.


147   EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAR PARK- DAY                             147

      MATHILDE walks towards a large FORD.

      She is carrying the BRIEFCASE.

      JACK has his right hand in his jacket pocket.

                          MATHILDE
                You won't need your piece.
                                                    105.


The slang word belies her. For an instant she has forgotten
her Belgian accent. She sounds American.

                    JACK
          You never know.

She stops beside the FORD.

JACK still has his hands on the Walther.

                       MATHILDE
          OK?

                       JACK
          Sure. You?

                    MATHILDE
          Everything's just fine.

She definitely sounds American now.

Her RIGHT HAND slips into her pocket.

JACK twists his wrist upwards and thumbs the cocking lever.

                    MATHILDE
          Final payment.

She hands JACK an ENVELOPE.

                    MATHILDE
          Buy yourself a retirement clock.

Her American accent shows that she's letting her guard down.
Maybe it's designed to make JACK do the same.

It doesn't.

                    JACK
          How do you know I'm retiring?

She leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on
the lips.

                    MATHILDE
          Have you taken your girl up to the
          meadow yet?

JACK doesn't answer. His whole body is tense for the bullet
that he knows his coming. Perhaps there is a second person in
the car.

Just then...

...a COACH pulls into the car park.

It stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS
descend.
                                                             106.


      MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved.

                             MATHILDE
                       (whispers to JACK)
                   Do it.

      She gets into the driver's seat of the FORD and swings the
      BRIEFCASE into the back.

                             MATHILDE
                   Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.

      JACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell.

      The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto
      the autostrada.

      JACK watches it go.

      Thumbs back the lever on his Walther.

      Gets into his Citroen.

      And opens the ENVELOPE.

      -No wires.

      -No tricks.

      -Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS.

      JACK stares at the money. He isn't supposed to be alive. For
      a while he stays put. He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and
      listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. To a girl
      calling: "Amore!" To the cicadas. To the distant rush of
      traffic on the autostrada.

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


148   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                          148

      JACK drives fast...

      ...turning off the highway beneath a sign for L'AQUILA.


149   EXT. L'AQUILA- DAY                                            149

      At the end a small street, JACK parks his car like a true
      Italian: illegally.

      Runs towards CLARA'S APARTMENT.

      And rings the buzzer.

      No answer.
                                                          107.


      JACK rings again.

      Still nothing.

      Shouts up at her window:

                             JACK
                CLARA!


150   EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY                                  150

      We're at another roadside service station.

      LARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken.

      He climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD.

      MATHILDE drives off.


151   INT. FORD- DAY                                              151

      LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt.

      He's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it.

                          LARRY
                Not only did you not kill him, you
                gave him my fucking money?

                          MATHILDE
                What else could I do? There were
                kids everywhere. Besides he's
                suspicious.

                          LARRY
                He's paranoid. That's why I'm
                paying you the GDP of a small
                country to get close to him. You
                could have got him in the sack. You
                should have got him in the car
                park. Now you're going to have to
                take him out long range!

                          MATHILDE
                I prefer it that way.

      She is a trained assassin. She respects JACK.

                          MATHILDE
                The Socimi is the perfect weapon.

                          LARRY
                Let's hope his workmanship is up to
                scratch.
                                                             108.


      He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING
      SUBMACHINE GUN.

                          LARRY
                Sweden turned Jack into a
                liability. Three stiffs: two
                shooters and an innocent civilian.
                I can't afford a mistake like that
                again. Europol are crooked but they
                aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to
                make me money. Not run up cleaning
                bills.

                           MATHILDE
                He made short work of the last guy
                you hired.

                          LARRY
                Never mind Larson. He didn't stand
                a chance, not against someone as
                paranoid as Jack. The Swede was
                only there to take Jack's heat off
                you. So don't fuck this up again.

      He grabs a TIN of fruit sweets.

                          LARRY
                Mind if I help myself?

      LARRY opens the tin to find it full of AMMUNITION.

                             LARRY
                Shit.

      He looks around the Ford.

                          LARRY
                Is there any actual candy in this
                gas guzzler?


152   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                          152

      JACK turns off under the sign for CASTEL DEL MONTE.


153   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH STEPS- DAY                      153

      The town square is jam-packed with cars and coaches.

      Hundreds of tourists and locals have gathered on the church
      steps. There is even a camera crew.

      The church doors open and FATHER BENEDETTO steps out to a
      huge cheer.

      Behind him, LOCAL MEN are carrying a larger than life painted
      wooden STATUE OF SAINT DOMINIC.
                                                            109.


      Draped over the saint's shoulder and wrapped around his neck
      are around twenty five or thirty live SNAKES- local Viperi-
      each one several feet long and as thick as a skinny forearm.

      A local BAND strikes up as the STATUE is carried down the
      steps, FATHER BENEDETTO leading the strange annual religious
      parade around the town square, followed by a group of ALTAR
      BOYS.


154   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- DAY                           154

      The giant FORD pulls up outside the town's only proper HOTEL.

      MATHILDE gets out carrying the SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE.


155   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      155

      JACK is looking for someone. The square is so tightly packed
      it's hard to see, let alone move.

      Then he spots her.

      CLARA.

      She's on the other side of the square, standing on the stone
      steps beneath a STATUE OF AN EAGLE. Her friend ANNA is beside
      her, taking photographs of the parade with a small digital
      camera. JACK moves towards CLARA.

      ANNA, through her viewfinder, is the first to notice him. She
      points JACK out to CLARA. CLARA waves at him. She says
      something to ANNA and descends into the crowd. JACK and CLARA
      squeeze their way through a sea of bodies towards one another
      as we cut to...


156   EXT. HOTEL ROOF- DAY                                         156

      MATHILDE emerges through the fire escape door and walks to
      the edge of the roof.

      She opens the black SAMSONITE CASE and unpacks the top layer
      of office paraphernalia to reveal the disassembled parts of
      the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

      Expertly she assembles the bastardised gun- including
      TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- slotting a full
      magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggling the butt
      to her shoulder and placing her eye beside the rubber cup on
      the sight.


157   EXT. POV FROM TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY                         157

      In the centre of the CROSS-HAIRS:
                                                          110.


      JACK and CLARA meet.

      She kisses him. It is a long and loving kiss.

      The CROSS-HAIRS find the centre of JACK's head.

      MATHILDE'S FINGER... taking up the trigger slack.

      Other HEADS...

      -LOCALS

      -KIDS on their PARENTS' SHOULDERS

      The TRIGGER FINGER, hesitating.


161   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                       161

      We're right in the midst of the crowd.

      JACK and CLARA have to shout at one another above the noise
      of the band.

                            JACK
                  When can I see you?

                            CLARA
                  I have to work tonight.

      Their happiness clouds over. But the clouds pass quickly.

                            CLARA
                  You come to my apartment after.

                            JACK
                  If I asked you would you come away
                  with me?

                            CLARA
                  Come away with you?

                             JACK
                  Why not?
                                                          111.


                             CLARA
                 Together?

                             JACK
                 Together.

                             CLARA
                 Where?

                           JACK
                 Wherever. Then when we're through,
                 we could come back here. For good.

                             CLARA
                 To live?

                           JACK
                 Where else?

                             CLARA
                 Forever?

                             JACK
                 Forever.

      A pause.

                           JACK
                 Unless you have other plans.

                           CLARA
                 Other plans?

      She swears in Italian. Obscenities. Then throws herself
      around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength. There are
      tears in her eyes.

                           CLARA
                 I love you, Signor Eduardo
                 Farfalla.

      He looks at her.

                             JACK
                 I...

      The TRIGGER FINGER squeezes.

      The SOCIMI SUBMACHINE fires.

      An EXPLOSIVE BULLET travels down the chamber at approximately
      360 miles per hour headed straight for JACK's temporal lobe.

      Only it never gets there.
                                                          112.


      The gun jams.

      A chamber explosion is a nasty thing. Instead of shooting out
      of the barrel, the round explodes in the cannon's chamber.

      Hot shrapnel fragments like a land mine, ripping into
      MATHILDE's hands, forearms and face...


163   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                    163

      A loud BANG pulls JACK and CLARA apart. Amidst the noise of
      the festival, no one else seems to notice.

      JACK looks in the direction of the HOTEL ROOF.

                          CLARA
                What's happening?

                          JACK
                Someone got what was coming to
                them.

      He turns to her:

                          JACK
                Go to your apartment and pack. Wait
                `till I get there. Don't answer the
                door to anyone but me.

                          CLARA
                Eduardo, please?

                            JACK
                Trust me.

      She looks at him.

                          CLARA
                I trust you.

      She wants to, but she doesn't.

                          JACK
                Clara. My name is not Eduardo.

                            CLARA
                No?

                          JACK
                My name is Jack.

                            CLARA
                Jack.

      She looks worried.
                                                           113.


                          CLARA
                You promise you're not married?

                          JACK
                I promise. Take this.

      He hands her an ENVELOPE. It contains his final instalment.

                          JACK
                Look after it. In case.

                          CLARA
                    (perplexed)
                In case?

      He wants to say it but he can't bring himself to.

      In case this is goodbye.

                             JACK
                Now go.


164   EXT. STREET- DAY                                            164

      LARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square.

      He is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone,
      scanning the crowds around him.

      In the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by, JACK steps
      free of a row cars on the other side of the street.

      As LARRY comes into view again, JACK sees the STERLING
      SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands.

      And LARRY sees JACK.

      LARRY'S FINGER tightens on the trigger.

      L'AMERICANO throws himself to one side.

      There is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along
      the line of parked cars.

      PANIC erupts.

      JACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover
      behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst.

      JACK is hit in the shoulder. He drops his gun...

      ...and retrieves it just as LARRY fires again.

      SCREAMS spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire
      moving down the street and spilling into the town square.
                                                          114.


165   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                       165

      JACK runs into the square.

      LARRY pursues him, firing for a third time.

      The buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo
      around the square, bouncing off the walls and confusing the
      crowd.

      People start to run in different directions- everyone heading
      for the maze of alleys that surround the main square.

      ALTAR BOYS scatter. So do the LOCAL MEN carrying the STATUE
      OF SAINT DOMINIC. The STATUE tumbles and smashes. Escaping
      SNAKES writhe. FATHER BENEDETTO takes cover.

      The two LOCAL CARABINIERI in their Land Rover get caught up
      in the chaos. Confused, they turn on their SIRENS.

      LARRY spots JACK in the crowd and fires a fourth time.

      One TOURIST is killed outright, another injured

      JACK dives for cover behind the STATUE OF THE EAGLE where he
      spotted Clara.

      Bullets ricochet.

                          LARRY
                You're too old for this life, Jack.

      LARRY struggles for breath as he reloads.

      This is JACK's chance.

                           LARRY
                You get sentimental then you fuck
                things up.

      Rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle, JACK
      spreads his legs, faces LARRY and fires the customary TWO
      PRECISION-ENGINEERED SHOTS that make up a military-style
      execution:

      The first shot hits LARRY in the heart. LARRY is thrown
      backwards against a parked car, accidentally altering his arc
      of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside JACK, chips of
      marble stinging against his calves.

      Again, JACK takes aim.

      A beat as his finger tightens on the trigger.

      HEADSHOT. Half LARRY'S FACE is wiped out of existence. What's
      left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees. His
      hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops. He falls
      forwards and his STERLING clatters on the cobble stones.
                                                    115.


Complete silence.

Not even the sound of a siren.

The town square is empty.

Except for FATHER BENEDETTO hiding in the wreckage of the
broken STATUE.

Jack's WALTHER hangs ominously by his side.

FATHER BENEDETTO stands unsteadily.

Like lightening JACK spins, instinctively raising his WALTHER
and zeroing in on FATHER BENEDETTO. His face is devoid of all
emotion. He is a bloody machine looking at a potential
target.

We hear SIRENS.

Across a slew of dead bodies, JACK keeps the gun pointed at
FATHER BENEDETTO.

FATHER BENEDETTO stands stock still, facing JACK.

The SIRENS get louder.

                    JACK
          What will you tell them?

A beat.

FATHER BENEDETTO takes something from inside his Soutane.

And holds it up with a trembling hand.

JACK'S LETTER.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          I will them that the man who wrote
          this letter is my friend.

FATHER BENEDETTO smiles sadly.

                    FATHER BENEDETTO
          Jack.

FATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer.

The SIRENS get closer.

We hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out
of their cars, cocking submachine guns.

When FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again...

...JACK has disappeared.
                                                          116.


166   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY                                 166

      Using his meticulous knowledge of the alleyways and lanes
      that make up the medieval heart of the town, JACK avoids the
      CARABINIERI and, stealing a bicycle, makes it onto the main
      road before a road block has been set up.


167   EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, LEFT LUGGAGE- DAY            167

      JACK collects a sports bag from a LOCKER.


168   EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, BATHROOM- DAY                168

      JACK washes the blood from his hands.


169   EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, MAIN HALL- DAY               169

      When he emerges from the bathroom JACK is wearing the clothes
      of a fifty year-old American tourist from the mid-West with
      glasses and a baseball cap.

      He checks the time of next bus to Rome.

      Then glances at his watch.

      He has thirty minutes.


170   EXT. L'AQUILA, STREET- DAY                                 170

      JACK walks towards Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.

      Two hundred metres up ahead, two OFFICERS of the Guardia di
      Finanza wait in an unmarked car.

      JACK walks past Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.

      And keeps walking.


171   EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION- DAY                          171

      The BUS for Rome is barely half-full.

      Blending in perfectly with a group of middle aged American
      tourists, JACK boards the steps, purchases a ticket and takes
      a seat at the rear.


172   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                       172

      A long tunnel: one of the longest in Europe.

      JACK alone at the back of the BUS.
                                                    117.


It seems like night: red stripes, strip lights, shadows.

Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes.

A button of light, expanding...

...as we burst into daylight.

INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT

Two men, CAESAR and MARTY "DUCKS," stand at  the   end of the
deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer
grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small
stage. Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the
boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.
                         DUCKS
           It's Peezee. Gotta be.    He hates your
           fuckin' guts.

                   (brooding)
           I don't know.
                         DUCKS
           Who else knew about the money? And
           how did Peezee know they popped Tony
           Cisco when we didn't even hear about
           it 'til last night?
                         CAESAR
                   (sighs heavily)
           I don't know.
                         DUCKS
                   (pressing)
           What is so hard to understand here?
           You said yourself Peezee was a
           mamaluke and you couldn't trust him.
           Now suddenly you're soft on the guy?
                         CAESAR
           I just don't think it was him.
                         DUCKS
           Okay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then
           who?
                         CAESAR
                   (slowly rising to
                    his full height)
           I think it was you, Ducks.
Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a
sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer
splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.
                         DUCKS
                   (scared)
           You gotta be kiddin'!
Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have

appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
                          DUCKS
            Caesar, you know me! What kind of
            fuckin' idiot would I have to be to
            try that shit with you?
                          CAESAR
            A dead fuckin' idiot.
As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty
"Ducks." Caesar doesn't look back.

INT. SING SING PRISON - NIGHT

Maximum-security prisoners are gathered around watching their
favorite show in the rec room. In the front row is PAUL VITTI,
former New York crime boss, and a couple of other wiseguys.
                           VITTI
            Garbage.   Change the channel.
                           WISEGUY
            Okay, Paul.
The WISEGUY gets up and starts switching channels on the TV.
A couple of CONVICTS in the back start to protest.
                           CONVICT
            Hey!   What're you doin', asshole!
Vitti turns and stares at them.      They fall silent
immediately.
                          CONVICT
            Sorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn't mean any
            disrespect.
                           WISEGUY
            Punks.
Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post:
MOB SHRINK TELLS ALL. He gets up, agitated.

                                                             3.
                        VITTI
          I'm going to bed.
Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.

INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER
As Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing
by. His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their
cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other
meager possessions.
                        VITTI
                  (suspicious)
          What's goin' on, Earl?
                        EARL
          They're transferring me.
                           VITTI
          Why?
                        EARL
                  (shrugs)
          Don't know. Thanks for looking out
          for me, Mr. Vitti.
                           VITTI
          Yeah.     Take it easy.
He notices something in the box.
                           VITTI
          Hey, Earl.     Is that my after-shave?
                         EARL
                  (blanches)
          I'm sorry. I just grabbed stuff -- I
          didn't know --
                           VITTI
          That's okay.     Keep it.   Go ahead.
                           EARL
          Thanks.     See you around.
Earl exits with the guard. Vitti hesitates a moment, then
warily steps into his cell.

INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAY
A deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an
easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel.
Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow
crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the
casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a
teenager, BEN'S MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS.
At the podium, the RABBI is speaking.
                        RABBI
          And now I'd like to call on Isaac's
          son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to
          say a few words.
Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium.

                        BEN
                  (addressing audience)
          It's very difficult for me to talk
          about my father, because in a sense
          I'm talking about two men.
                           BEN (CONT'D)
          One, of    course, is the public Isaac
          Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and
          popular    author known to millions of
          readers    around the world.
Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.
                        BEN
          The second Isaac Sobel is the private
          man -- my father -- Dad. And for
          those of you who knew him well and
          knew our family -- well, let's face it

Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned

INT. SING SING - MESS HALL - NEXT DAY

Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line
with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.
                         WISEGUY #2
          Ooh, they got tapioca. I love
          tapioca.
                   (looks at Vitti)
          You all right, Paul?
Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.
                        WISEGUY #2
          Can I have your tapioca?

A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from
his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.
COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in
response.
Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other
tough Hispanic gang members.
                        COYOTE
                  (to Vitti)
          Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?
His friends laugh.
Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.
                        COYOTE
          Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.
                        COYOTE
          Shut up!
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.
                        COYOTE
          I said, shut up, bitch!

                                                             7.
But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering
food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.
                        COYOTE
          You're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly
whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray
and bursts into song.
                        VITTI
                  (singing, with
                   appropriate dance
                   moves)
          'When you're a Jet,
          You're a Jet all the way,
          From your first cigarette
          To your last dyin' day...'
Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.
Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him
over the head with the tray.
                        VITTI
          'When you're a Jet,
          If the shit hits the fan,
          You got brothers around,
          You're a family man...'
                        COYOTE
          You're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the
face.
Guards move in from all sides.   Vitti jumps up on the
tabletop to escape them.
                        VITTI

The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then
carry him out stiff as a board.

Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them
in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her
late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is
a clean-cut man in his thirties.

          Dr. Sobel, I'm Agent Miller, this is
          Special Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau

Agent Cerrone crosses her legs, a move that does not go
unnoticed by Ben and Michael.

Vitti's jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat,
staring forward.
                          BEN
          Paul?   Paul?
Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face.       Nothing.
                        DR. CUTLER
          This is how it's been. He sings for a
          while, then he goes completely
          catatonic.
                        BEN
                  (skeptical)
          Really. Can we take him to an
          examining room?
                          DR. CUTLER
          Of course.

INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
Vitti sits inert on the examination table.
                        BEN
          You already did a neurological work-
          up?
                       DR. CUTLER
          Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign
          of stroke --

                                                               13.

Ben slaps Vitti's face lightly a couple times.
                        BEN
          Completely catatonic --
He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose.     Vitti does not react.
                        BEN
          Totally gone. Well, I don't think
          he's smart enough to be faking.
          Street smart, yes, but we're talking
          about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom
          slipper.
Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reaction.
Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.
                        BEN
          So if I just stuck him with this
          needle, he probably wouldn't even
          respond.
                          DR. CUTLER
          I don't know.    Try it.
Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, then

                          BEN
          Okay --
He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder.
                        VITTI

Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.     Dr. Cutler observes
from a chair in the corner.
                        BEN
          Paul, we're going to    give you some
          tests to assess your    mental condition.
          There's no pressure    -- just answer as
          best you can. Do I     have your consent
          to share the results    of these tests?

                        BEN
          I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm
          going to show you ten cards, each
          containing a picture of an inkblot. I
          want you to look at each card and tell
          me what you see.
                         VITTI
          I see you.   I see him.   I see a table.
                        BEN
          Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the
          card yet.
                  (hands him first card)
          What does this look like to you? Take
          your time.
Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card.    It's all white.
                        VITTI
          It looks like snow.
                        BEN
          No, Paul, the other side.
Vitti turns it over and makes a face.

                         VITTI
          A bat.   A big bat. Or a weasel.
                        BEN
                  (taking notes)
          Bat or weasel. All right.
                        VITTI
          And he's got a little girl -- no, it's
          a little boy -- in his teeth -- and
          he's shakin' him and shakin' him
          'cause the kid didn't wipe himself
          good -- and the kid is screaming
          because the bat-weasel ripped out his
          throat and the blood is shootin' out
          of his neck vein.
                  (pointing)
          That's the blood.
Doctor Cutler looks worried.

INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York.
                        BEN
          Based on his symptoms and the test
          results, I'd say brief psychotic
          disorder -- if it persists, possibly
          schizophreniform disorder. And Dr.
          Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.
                         CHAPIN
          So he's crazy?

                                          17.
               BEN
Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but --
              CHAPIN
Vitti.
              BEN
Not crazy. At least not permanently.
In certain people, continuous exposure
to an extremely stressful situation --
soldiers in combat, for instance,
disaster victims, a hostage situation,
or being locked up in a maximum
security prison with someone trying to
kill you -- it can produce a temporary
psychotic state.
              CHAPIN
How temporary?
              BEN
A day, a week, up to a month -- if the
precipitating stressors are removed.
              CHAPIN
        (musing)
Which means he's not going to get any
better while he's still in the can.
              BEN
He could get worse. He could
deteriorate to the point where he'd be
permanently schizophrenic.
              CHAPIN
Then I'd say he's got a real problem,
because he goes before the parole
board in four weeks.
              BEN
You think they'll let him out?
              CHAPIN
Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll want to
release a major Mafia figure who's now
totally deranged on top of it.
              BEN
        (thinks)
Well, couldn't you release him to    a
halfway house or some place where    he
could get some decent treatment?
Based on my earlier work with him,    I
don't think he's dangerous, and I
think he was making a real effort    to
reform himself.

              CHAPIN

        (thinks for a
         long moment)
Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm
gonna release him into your custody.
              BEN
Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for
me. My father just died -- and I've
got this bulging disc in my neck --
and we're redecorating, which is a
total nightmare. I can't --
              CHAPIN
You want to see him killed in prison?
              BEN
No, of course not.
              CHAPIN
Or sent to a facility for the
criminally insane.
               BEN
No --

              CHAPIN
Then he's all yours. I'm going to
talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get
you certified as a temporary federal
institution.
                BEN
          (stricken)
What?    I can't be an institution.
               CHAPIN
        (firm)
You've got thirty days to get him in
shape for his parole hearing. That
means sane, sober and gainfully
employed. But let me warn you,
Doctor. If he fucks up in any way --
if he flees, or if I find out that
this whole thing was just a setup so
he could get back on the street and
return to a life of crime -- I will
hold you totally responsible, and I'll
see that you are stripped of your
license and prosecuted to the full
extent of the law. Are we clear?
                 BEN
          (gulp)
Yes.    We're clear.

Ben and Vitti pull into the driveway and get out of the car.
                        BEN
          Want to grab your stuff?
                        VITTI
          I'm not gonna be here that long.
          Jelly's pickin' me up in an hour.
                        BEN
          Paul! I don't think you understand.
          You're in my custody. I could get in
          a lot of trouble if you screw up.
                        VITTI
          Don't worry about it.     I'll call you
          tomorrow.
                        BEN
          Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing
          Sing? Thursday's meatloaf night. I
          can have you back there in no time.
          The U.S. Attorney was very clear. You
          stay with me; therapy every day; you
          can't leave the area without
          permission --

                        VITTI
          What are you, my father now?
                           BEN
          And you    have to get a job as soon as
          you're    well enough, which is now. So
          are you    coming in with me or do I have
          to make    a phone call?
Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat.
                          VITTI
          I'm comin'.    Some fuckin' life this is
          gonna be.

Chapin is conferring with another U.S. ATTORNEY, DAVIS, and
Agents Miller and Cerrone.
                        CERRONE
          You really think Vitti is crazy?
                        CHAPIN
          Yeah, he's about as crazy as I am.

                                                            23.
          Think about it. Locked up, he was
          absolutely no use to me. But back on
          the street, Vitti's still powerful
          enough to pose a threat to both
          families. It's like throwing gasoline
          on a fire.
                        DAVIS
          If we can use Vitti to escalate this
          war, we might just end up putting them
          all away.

                        MILLER
          That's if he goes back to his old
          life.
                        CHAPIN
          If? People like Paul Vitti     don't
          change. This guy's been a     menace to
          society since he was twelve    years old.
          Being a criminal is all he    knows.
          Trust me.
                        DAVIS
          He's gonna head straight for trouble.
          Then all we have to do is sit back and
          pick up the pieces. We could get
          twenty, maybe even thirty indictments
          next time the grand jury convenes.
                        CHAPIN

          You know, Giuliani started this way.

          You running for mayor?

          Could happen.     Just stick with Vitti.

She scrubs the plate with manic energy.

          You should be in an institution.     Why

          Somebody said something about coffee.
                          LAURA
          That was you.    You said you wanted
          some.

          Why don't you make your friend some
          coffee. I'm going upstairs to take a
          long bath and hopefully drown.
Laura smiles at the two men, then exits.

          You'll have to forgive her.     She's
          usually a great hostess.
                        VITTI
          I understand. She's uncomfortable.
          The whole situation's a little awkward
          with me bein' here -- but let's face
          it, Emily fuckin' Post she's not.
                        BEN
          Emily fuckin' Post. Well, that
          explains why she rarely used her
          middle name.

          Listen, I got a friend coming over.     I
          didn't want you to be surprised.
                           BEN
          What    kind of friend? Because if it's
          'The    Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or

          tool    --

            Laura.

                          VITTI
            I heard her busting your balls.
                           BEN
            We were having a disagreement. A
            certain amount of conflict is normal
            in a marriage.

              BEN
I know the last few weeks have been
kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying
and everything -- and it might've felt
to you like I didn't have time for you
or I didn't care about how you feel.
              MICHAEL
No, it didn't.
              BEN
Good. Because I want you to know that
you can talk to me about stuff and
that I can really listen and
understand what you're going through.
              MICHAEL
I do, Dad.
              BEN
And if I seemed a little hard on
Grandpa, it's just that your
grandfather was a hard man in a lot of
ways. He wanted everything done his
way and sometimes I just felt like
nothing I ever did was good enough. I
don't want it to be that way with us.
              MICHAEL
It's not.
              BEN
And you know, at times like this we
all might start questioning our own
mortality and you might be thinking
how devastated you'd be if I died.
Right?
               MICHAEL
No.   Not really.
              BEN
That's good. Good talk. And I
realize it's all a little hectic right
now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only
temporary, okay?

Oh, really? I didn't hear you the

          cooked meal after being in prison that
          long.

                                                          31.

                        VITTI
          Yeah, that's what I've been jerkin'
          off about for eight hundred
          consecutive nights -- a nice home-
          cooked meal.
                  (making a jerking
                   motion)
          Ohhhh, tuna casserole.
                        BEN
          That girl is not staying here.

                        VITTI
          I think you're jealous.
                        BEN
          Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous.
                        VITTI
          I didn't hear nothin' comin' out of
          your room.
                        BEN
          We don't think it's necessary to wake
          the neighbors every time we have sex.

                        VITTI
          Hey, if you're really quiet, you might
          be able to do it without even wakin'
          up your wife.
                         SHEILA (O.S.)
                   (moaning)
          Ohhh.   Ohhh.
Ben looks curiously at Vitti.
                        VITTI
          I told her if I wasn't back in two
          minutes to start without me. I gotta
          go.
Vitti heads back upstairs.
                        BEN
          This is not a good start, Paul.
                                                CUT TO:
INT. DINING AREA - NEXT MORNING
Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town
relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated,
older woman.

                                                           32.

                        LAURA
          Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put
          you up at the hotel. We wanted you
          here with us, but we had an unexpected
          house guest.
She glares at Ben.
                        AUNT ESTHER
                  (sighs)
          Your father always had room for us.

                        BEN
          I'm sorry.
                  (mutters to Laura)
          Next time I lose a parent, I'll be
          sure to reserve the guest room.
A DOOR SLAMS somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room
sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt.
                        SHEILA
                  (screaming)
          Go to hell, Paul! You just go to
          hell!

                         VITTI (O.S.)
          Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy
          fuckin' whore.
Vitti charges into the room, his robe open. From the
reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not
wearing anything under it.
                        VITTI
          Go back to turning tricks in Jersey
          for all I fuckin' care.
Sheila exits and slams the front door.   Vitti sees everyone
staring at him. He closes his robe.
                        VITTI
          How's it goin'?
                  (sees buffet)
          Oh, we got food. Good.
Vitti heads for the buffet.
                        LAURA
                  (smiling)
          Ben?
                        BEN
                  (quickly)
          Paul?

                                                            33.
Vitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older
couple. He eyes the food disdainfully.
                        VITTI
          Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have
          to fuck to get some bacon around here?
The woman reacts in horror.
                        VITTI
          Not you, I'm guessing.

                        BEN
                  (snags Vitti's arm)
          Why don't we go to my office?   I'll
          make you a plate.
                                                 CUT TO:
INT. BEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Ben and Vitti enter.   Vitti still in his robe.
                        VITTI
          What is it with your relatives?   They
          tend to overreact quite a bit.

                        BEN
          I know. All you did was flash
          everybody in the dining room.
                        VITTI
          So? From the look of 'em, some of
          those broads haven't seen the old
          salcicc' in a long time. It's good
          for them.
                        BEN
          Well, when the paramedics revive my
          Aunt Goldie, I'll be sure to ask her.
          Sit.
Vitti starts for Ben's chair.
                        BEN
          Ah ah ah!
He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair.
                        BEN
          So what are you going to do, Paul?
                        VITTI
          What do you mean?
                        BEN
          With your life.

                                                          34.

                        VITTI
          First I'm gonna find out who's tryin'
          to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody
          could shoot right through that window
          -- blow my fuckin' head off.
Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out
of the way.

                        BEN
          Okay, that's a priority. Have you
          thought about what you're going to do
          for work?
                        VITTI
          Yeah. I'm too big for a jockey so
          I was thinkin' maybe a hairdresser.
          They'll call me Mr. Paul.
                       BEN
          Come on. There must be something you
          like to do.
                        VITTI
          I like hitting a guy on the head with
          a baseball bat.
                        BEN
          Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the
          want ads tomorrow but don't get your
          hopes up. Anything else?
                        VITTI
          Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the
          usual --
                         BEN
          Who are you?
                        VITTI
          Who am I? I'm the guy who's paying
          you $150 an hour to play these stupid
          fuckin' games. You know who I am.
                         BEN
          I know that.   I mean what are you?
                        VITTI
          What do you mean, 'What am I?'
                        BEN
          I just want to know how you see
          yourself.

                                                     35.
                        VITTI
          You're making me very fuckin' nervous.
                        BEN
          Just answer the question.     What are
          you?
                        VITTI
                  (shrugs)
          I'm the boss.
                        BEN
          Really? The boss of what -- Jelly?
          You're not the boss of me. So what
          are you the boss of?
                        VITTI
          You, you're good. I see what you're
          doing here.
                        BEN
          What am I doing, Paul?
                        VITTI
          You're pissing me off is what you're
          doing. Look at me. It's starting
          again, the anxiety.

                          BEN
          I understand.
                           BEN (CONT'D)
          You've    spent your whole life becoming
          who you    are and now you can't be that
          anymore    -- that's gotta be scary. If
          you're    not Paul Vitti the mob boss,
          who are    you?
Vitti is at a loss.
                        BEN
          Well, let's think. When you were a
          kid, What did you want to be?
                          VITTI
          I don't know.    Who remembers that
          stuff?
                        BEN
          You must've wanted to be something
          when you were little -- fireman?
                          VITTI
          No.
                        BEN
          Baseball player?

                                           36.

                VITTI
No.

                BEN
Astronaut?
                VITTI
No.
                BEN
Al Capone?

                VITTI
Yeah, maybe.    What did you want to be?
              BEN
We're not talking about me.
                VITTI
I am.
               BEN
Fine.   I wanted to be a philatelist.
              VITTI
You wanted to look up people's
assholes all day?
              BEN
No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of
a proctologist. I wanted to collect
rare and unusual stamps.
              VITTI
You must've been a lot of laughs when
you were a kid. Lonely, huh?
             BEN
Oh yeah. Big time.      So what did you
want to be?
                VITTI
It's stupid.
              BEN
You afraid to tell me?
              VITTI
Yeah, I'm afraid.
                BEN
Then tell me.    I'm not here to judge
you.

                                        37.
              VITTI
        (a beat)
Okay. When I was really little --
like seven or eight -- maybe I wanted
to be a cowboy.
               BEN
A cowboy.   Really?
              VITTI
Yeah. My father gave   me a cowboy
suit -- you know, the  vest, the
chaps, the cap guns --  the whole
thing. And he used to   take me up
to my uncle's farm in  New Jersey
and lead me around on  this pony.
Yippee-i-o. You happy   now?
              BEN
So you watched cowboy movies and TV
shows with your father.
              VITTI
Everybody. The whole family.     My
father loved 'Gunsmoke.'
              BEN
Sheriff Dillon.
              VITTI
        (corrects him)
Marshal Dillon.
                BEN
Marshal.    So who were your favorite
cowboys?
              VITTI
This is so fuckin' retarded.
               BEN
Paul!
              VITTI
All right. Gene Autry, Roy Rogers,
the Lone Ranger --
               BEN
Interesting.   They're all good guys.
               VITTI
Yeah, I guess.
              BEN
No, that's important. You didn't want
to be the bad guy. You wanted to be
the hero.

                                                             38.

                          VITTI
          Yeah, so?

                        BEN
          So what happened?
                          VITTI
          I don't know.    Nothing happened.
                        BEN
          So why didn't you become a cowboy?

                        VITTI
          I lived in East Harlem! I joined a
          street gang when I was 12 and that was
          it.
                        BEN
          Something else happened when you were
          twelve.
                          VITTI
          What?
                        BEN
                  (prompting)
          Something that made you very sad?
                        VITTI
          The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to
          L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard.
                        BEN
          Something else.
                        VITTI
          We playin' a guessing game here?
                        BEN
          Paul! Your father was murdered!
          Right in front of you. Remember?
                        VITTI
          Do I remember? I think about it every
          fuckin' day of my life. What's that
          got to do with it?
                        BEN
          It's got everything   to do with it. He
          gave you the cowboy   suit. With a
          white hat. He was    in the mob, but he
          wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't
          he?
Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep.

                                                   39.
                          VITTI
          Yeah.   He did.
                        BEN
          He didn't want you in the gang life.
          He only did it himself so you wouldn't
          have to. He was trying to buy you a
          better life than his.
                        VITTI
                  (crying harder)
          He always said he wanted me to go to
          college. I didn't even finish high
          school.
He really starts sobbing now.
                        BEN
          Well, Paul, this could be a  great
          opportunity for you. You're   right
          back where you were when you  were
          twelve. You've got some big   choices
          to make.
Vitti fights to regain control.
                          VITTI
          Okay.   Okay.   That's enough of that
          shit.
                        BEN
          It's not shit, Paul. My point is,
          when you're a child, you think
          anything is possible. Wouldn't it be
          great to think like that now?
                        VITTI
                  (retreating back into
                   his cynicism)
          Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy
          dust on me.
                        BEN
          I'm just saying you've got to keep
          an open mind and explore some new
          possibilities. Try some different
          things -- maybe you'll connect with
          one of them. There's a career
          counselor I work with. I can call
          him for you. He may be able to help
          you find a job.
                        VITTI
          You mean working for somebody? I'm
          supposed to take orders from some guy
          who used to get me coffee?
                  (starts sweating and

                                                          40.
                   breathing hard)
          I can't do that. It's not right.
          It's not me.

                        BEN
          How do you know unless you try?
Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS.
Ben dives for cover. Silence -- then another RAP on the
window. Ben looks out and sees JELLY in the back yard,
tossing stones at the window.

                        JELLY
                  (calls out)
          Hiya, Doc. Sorry about the window.
Ben waves him around to the side door.
                                               CUT TO:
INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
Jelly is loading up a plate of food from the buffet, talking
to the elderly relatives. Laura stares at him.
                         JELLY
          I love  lox and bagels. I dated a
          Jewish  woman once. Actually, she
          might  have been the love of my life,
          but my  mother broke it up.
                        JELLY (CONT'D)
          She was always hockin' me a chinick
          about the madels. A wonderful woman,
          my mother, but she fuckin' hates the
          Hebes.
                         LAURA
          Really.
                  (noting mountain of
                   food on his plate)
          More smoked salmon? Don't be shy.
Ben enters.
                        BEN
          Jelly -- what are you doing here?
                        JELLY
          Makin' new friends. How's it going,
          Doc? I brought some clothes for Mr.
          Vitti.
                          LAURA
                    (indicating the door)
          Ben?

                                                          41.

                        BEN
          That's great, Jelly. I'd love to
          catch up with you -- outside.

                        JELLY
                  (rising)
          You got it.
                  (to Laura)
          Thanks, Mrs. S.
                  (to others)
          So long, everybody.    Ess gesunterhait.

Jelly and Ben exit.
                                                CUT TO:
EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ben and Jelly walk out to the driveway where Jelly's Buick is
parked.
                       JELLY
          So. Long time no see.     You look good,
          Doc.
                        BEN
                  (trying to be pleasant)
          And you, Jelly -- you look --
                  (can't find words for
                   how he looks)
          Did you get a haircut? I thought you
          were in prison.
                        JELLY
          It would appear not.
                        BEN
          How'd you get out?
                        JELLY
          New trial. The evidence in my first
          trail was, you know, tainted. Turns
          out two of the witnesses against me
          changed their minds -- and the third
          one, he died after a short illness.
                        BEN
          What did he have?
                        JELLY
          Gunshot wound to the head.
                        BEN
          That's not an illness.

                                                             42.
                        JELLY
          Yeah, but it is short.
Vitti, now dressed, comes out of the house and crosses to the
car.
                        BEN
                  (to Vitti)
          Where are you going?
                        VITTI
          I got stuff to do.

                        BEN
          What kind of stuff?
                        VITTI
                  (as he gets into
                   the car)
          Calm down. I'll be back.
                        BEN
          You can't leave without my permission.
                         VITTI
          Oh, yeah?   Watch me.   Drive, Jelly.

Jelly STARTS the CAR and slowly backs out of the driveway.
Ben runs after the car, talking to Vitti through the open
window.
                        BEN
          That's it, Paul. I forbid you to go.
                        VITTI
          Stop sweating, Doc.     I'll be back.
Vitti puts the window up.
                        BEN
                  (shouts anxiously)
          If you screw this up, Paul -- Paul!
The car pulls away.
                         BEN
                   (angrily)
          Shit!   Shit, shit, shit!
Ben turns and sees his Aunt Goldie on the porch.
                        AUNT GOLDIE
          So, the fat one -- he's single?

INT. KNIGHTS OF PALERMO SOCIAL CLUB - DAY
Soldiers lounge at the bar, keeping a respectful distance
from the capos seated at a table in the rear. All eyes turn
as the door opens and Vitti enters.
SAL MASIELLO, Vitti's old consigliere rises and warmly but
warily welcomes Vitti back into the fold.
                        MASIELLO
          Paulie, great to see you! You're
          lookin' good, kid. Lookin' very good.
          Jelly, how are ya?
Vitti embraces him and they sit down with the others.
                        MASIELLO
          So, Paul, we heard you had some
          trouble while you were away. Some
          'mental' problems.
                        VITTI
          No, I'm okay. It was an act. I had
          to pretend I was nuts. There were
          people watching me all the time.
                        MASIELLO
          Little people?
                        VITTI
          Doctors. They never woulda let me out
          if they thought I was normal.
                        MASIELLO
          So you ain't crazy?
                        VITTI
          You want to see crazy? Just tell me
          who's trying to kill me. I'll show
          you crazy.
                        MASIELLO
          We're in a war, Paul -- nobody's safe
          right now. The Rigazzis are walkin'
          all over us. We got next to nothing
          coming in, and I don't have to tell
          you, you don't buy a lot of muscle
          without money these days. We need
          you, Paul. The family needs you.
                        VITTI
          I can't do it, Sal.   I'm out of it.
                        MASIELLO
          Come on, Paulie. Nobody used to do
          the big jobs like you. Air France--
          they're still talkin' about it.

                                                             44.

                        VITTI
          Sal, even if I wanted to -- the feds

                        MASIELLO
          After your father died, I always
          treated you like my own son. You know
          that.
                          VITTI
          I know.

                        MASIELLO
          He was a good man. I still miss him.
                        VITTI
          Yeah, I do too.
                        MASIELLO
          So you'll think about it.    For me,
          Paulie?
                        VITTI
          Yeah, okay, I'll think about it.
                         MASIELLO
                  (brightening)
          Hey, what is this -- a fuckin' funeral
          here? You just got back from college
          for Chrissakes. We should be havin' a
          party for you.
                  (to bartender)
          Hey, Nino, give everybody a round
          here. We gotta drink to Paul.
                          VITTI
          I can't, Sal.    I gotta go talk to the
          boss.
                        MASIELLO
          I understand. No problem. It's good
          to have you back, Paul.
                  (embraces him)
          Don't forget what I said. We're
          countin' on you.
Vitti gives his old friend a pat on the back and exits.

EXT. LOPRESTI HOUSE - SAME MORNING
Jelly pulls up, Vitti gets out and strides up to the front
door of a nice home on Staten Island and RINGS the BELL.

INT. ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The door is opened by EDDIE DEVOL, early thirties, dark and
sullen.

                          EDDIE
          Yeah, what?
                          VITTI
          'Yeah, what?'    That's how you answer
          the door?

                        EDDIE
          You got a problem with that?
                          VITTI
          Yeah.
Vitti punches Eddie in the mouth, sending him sprawling back
into the living room. Several other bodyguards are watching
television, caught off guard by Vitti's sudden entrance.
                          VITTI
          Where is she?
                        PATTY (O.S.)
                  (calls out)
          In the kitchen, Paul.

INT. PATTY'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vitti enters. PATTY LOPRESTI, mid-forties, still sexy even
in an apron, is mixing cake batter in a bowl with an electric
mixer.
                        PATTY
          Paul -- what a nice surprise.
                        VITTI
          How's it goin', Patty?
                         PATTY
          Good.   It's good. Give me a kiss,
          you.
Patty hugs and kisses him, taking the opportunity to pat him
down for a weapon or a hidden wire.
                        VITTI
          Sorry to hear about Carmine.     He was a
          good man.
                        PATTY
          Yeah. You live with a person twenty-
          one years, then one day they're

                                                          46.
          pulling his torso out of the river.
          It's hard.
                        VITTI
          I'll bet -- especially with all the
          talk about you being the one who put
          him there.
                        PATTY
          That's why I try not to gossip, Paul.
          It's ugly. Just a sec.
                  (screaming to ceiling)
          Michelle! Teresa! It's ten-thirty!
          Stop fucking around and get ready for
          ballet!
                  (to Vitti)
          It's hard being a single parent and a
          career woman.
                        VITTI
          Yeah, I'm sure you're very busy.
                        PATTY
          The pressure -- it's awful. For
          instance, a lot of people think, now
          that you're out, you're going to try
          and take the family back from me. But
          I said, no, Paul would never do that.
                  (smiling)
          By the way, how are Marie and the
          kids? Still in Ohio? In Shaker
          Heights? At 1356 Locust?
Vitti explodes, reaches across the counter and grabs her by
the shoulders.
                        VITTI
                  (enraged)
          You even go near them, you crazy bitch
          --
                        PATTY
                  (quietly)
          Don't make me call my guys in. You
          may need the shit kicked out of you,
          but not in here. I just mopped.
Vitti lets her go.
                         PATTY
                   (smoothing clothes,
                    flushed and a little
                    excited)
          Wow.   Have you been working out?
                        VITTI
          Yeah, I been workin' out who's trying

          to kill me. I'd love to hear your
          thoughts on that.
                        PATTY
          It's a dog-eat-dog world out there.
          Nobody's gonna be safe unless we can
          end this thing with the Rigazzis.
                        VITTI
          So then you didn't have nothin' to do
          with it.
                          PATTY
                   (hurt)
          Oh, Paul. You actually think I would
          kill you? All the years we've known
          each other -- the Christmas parties,
          the fun times at the beach. It
          wouldn't be right. I want us to be
          friends.
                   (smiles demurely)
          Who knows? Maybe we'll be more than
          friends. Want to lick my beaters?
She holds the beaters out to him.
                        VITTI
                  (declining)
          Thanks. I gotta see a guy about a
          business thing.
                        PATTY
          What kind of business? You know, if
          you get something going, we would
          expect some kind of consideration -- a
          little taste.
                        VITTI
          No, this is a legitimate business.
                        PATTY
                  (shudders)
          Oh, Paul. I just got a chill.
                        VITTI
          I just want to be left alone.   Put my
          life back together -- straight  up this
          time. Put the word out, will   ya?
          Nobody's got nothin' to worry  about
          from me.
                          PATTY
          Sure, Paul.    I understand.
He heads for the door.

                                                            48.
                        PATTY
                  (calls after him)
          Don't be a stranger!

After Vitti leaves, Eddie enters from the other door.
                        PATTY
                  (turning to Eddie)
          Watch him like a hawk. If he steps
          out of line, it would break my heart,
          but shoot him in the fuckin' head.

EXT. PARK AVENUE AUDI DEALERSHIP - LATER
Vitti is trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the
MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged couple. Vitti opens
the trunk.
                        VITTI
          Look at the size of that trunk. You
          could fit three people in there.
                  (off their
                   shocked looks)
          Not people -- suitcases. It's a joke.

The MacInernys laugh uncertainly.
                        VITTI
          So what are you driving now?
                        MR. MacINERNY
          We have a Lexus.
                         VITTI
                  (nods)
          It's a fancy Toyota, right? The Japs

A crowd of well-heeled New Yorkers surround Vitti at the

                                                            49.

                        JOEY BOOTS
          Paul, I heard you were out.

                        VITTI
          Hey, Joey.
                        JOEY BOOTS
          All dressed up for dinner, huh?
                        VITTI
          Yeah.

The Maitre D' crosses away and waves at Vitti.
                        MAITRE D'
          Paul, that table for six is ready.
          You can send them back.
                        JOEY BOOTS
          You're working here?
                        VITTI
                  (dying)
          Nah -- not really. It's like -- I'm
          on parole, so I just -- I come in, I
          greet people.

Joey and his friends nod condescendingly.
                        JOEY BOOTS
          Okay. I get it. Nice seein' you,
          Paul. Don't want to hold you up. You
          got people to seat.
Joey and his guys walk away, they turn back and glance at
Vitti, then whisper something in audible to each other
and laugh.
Vitti burns, humiliated.

Vitti moves to leave.

             Hey, could you get us a big bottle of
             Pellegrino and another round of
             drinks?

He slips Vitti a couple of bills.        Vitti stares at the money
in his hand.
                           BUSINESSMAN
             And more bread when you get a chance.
                           VITTI
             You want more bread?
He takes a small loaf from the breadbasket on the next table,
stuffs it into the Businessman's mouth and walks off.
                           VITTI
             I'll get your drinks now.

Two Hassidim are in the back of a 47th Street jewelry store,
sorting through a huge pile of diamonds.
Behind the    display counter, Vitti stares at the diamonds,
breathing    hard, starting to perspire. His customers, a
thirty-ish    YOUNG MAN and his FIANCEE, study the diamond
engagement    ring on her finger.

DREAM SEQUENCE - INT. BEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Vitti is on the sofa. He's wearing a shiny, silk, short-
sleeved shirt with the sleeves turned up, tight, black chino
pants and short, black, pointy-toed boots. His hair is oiled
and coifed like early Frankie Avalon.
                        VITTI
                  (distraught)
          I can't deal with this shit. My
          grades suck, I'm gettin' in fights
          every day, and if I get suspended
          again my mother's gonna fuckin' kill
          me -- if the nuns don't kill me first.


BEN
is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund Freud.
                        BEN

          Eins, zwei, drei!

          What?
VITTI'S MOTHER is sitting next to him.

                  (elbows him)
          Sit up straight! Pay attention when
          the doctor talks to you. This is
          costing money.
Ben (Freud) has a large TAXI METER TICKING away beside him.
                         VITTI
          Ma?   What are you doin' here?

          I tell him the same thing.
Suddenly, the WINDOWS are SHATTERED by GUNFIRE.

DOOR
BLASTS open, flying off the hinges. Jelly enters, pushed
into the room by a gang of thugs, led by Patty LoPresti,
Eddie DeVol and his guys, all at least ten-feet-tall and all
holding huge guns.

VITTI
leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun, but instead pulls
out a long sword. Confused but desperate, he holds up the
sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes
limp. He tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps
dropping like a piece of soft rope.
Patty, Eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at Vitti,
while Jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears
pouring from his eyes.

Vitti is back in bed in his robe, still asleep. The door
opens and Laura enters with an interior decorator who has
fabric samples over her arm.

          Now in here, I thought we'd get rid of
          the wallpaper and maybe put in some
          wainscoting --
She sees Vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside.

She comes back in, closes the bedroom door and confronts
Vitti who is still groggy from his troubling dream.

         You want a sandwich? Make it
         yourself. I'm not afraid of you, Mr.
         Oh-I'm-A-Great-Big-Mobster Man. I

         We have so much in common. Anyway,
         this is not helping me, it's not
         helping my marriage, and I know Ben

Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob,
then quickly pulls himself together.

EXT. NOGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Ben and Laura walk up to a trendy Japanese restaurant in
Chelsea. Ben is really keyed up.
                        LAURA
          We finally got him out of the house --
          why are we having dinner with him? I
          mean, how professional is that?
                        BEN
          This is not social. Paul's meeting a
          television producer who might have a
          job for him. He's nervous and wants
          me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer,
          that's all.
                        LAURA
          He's a grown man. I don't see why he
          needs a chaperone.
                        BEN
          He doesn't. He needs a buffer.    I'm
          here in buffer capacity only.
                        LAURA
          Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time
          --
Ben pops a couple of pills.
                        LAURA
          Didn't you just take two of those?
                        BEN
          No, that was something else.
                        LAURA
          Well, you better not drink anything.
          You know what happens.
                        BEN
          Laura? I'm a doctor?     I think I know

Ben opens the door and motions for Laura to enter.

Seated at a table are Ben and    Laura, Vitti and Sheila, Jelly,
and the producer RAOUL BERMAN    and his uptight, downtown
GIRLFRIEND. Jelly inspects a     piece of raw octopus, while
Raoul gushes over a platter of    sushi and sashimi.
                        RAOUL
          I adore this place. Best sushi in
          town. Have you tried the yellowtail,
          Paul?
Raoul picks up a floppy piece of raw fish with his
chopsticks.
                        VITTI

          No. We gettin' any real food?     This
          is like eatin' fuckin' bait.
Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend.
Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. He's
suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze
and he's oddly thick-lipped.
                        BEN
          Bait! That's funny. Honey, did you
          hear what Paul just said? He said
          this is like eating bait.

Oh -- this? I took a couple ibuprofen

lasts a couple hours.
        (to Raoul)
Rah-oo. Row. Rowl. I guess you need
both lips for that name. You know
what I love about Paul? He
was born without a filter. He
says exactly what he's thinking --
just lays it right out there. He
doesn't edit himself.
              VITTI

You wanna shut the fuck up?

See? He just told me to shut the fuck

Isn't he great?

Too much buffering. Way too much.
               RAOUL

Yes. Paul, I'm such a huge fan of
yours -- not a fan, but you know, an
admirer.
              VITTI
Don't admire me too much.

          Wow. That would be incredible. Did

          know if you'd be interested in working

          So what do you think, Paul?

          Yeah, sure, whatever.

          This is so exciting. Mr. Berman, I
          love your show. Anthony Bella, the
          guy who plays Nicky Caesar -- I think
          he grew up in Bensonhurst next door to
          my cousin's friend's husband.

          That's her claim to fame.
                  (to Sheila)
          I hate to bust your bubble, but he's
          not from Bensonhurst. He's a
          professional Italian. He grew up in
          Connecticut or something like that.
                        SHEILA
          Well, wherever he's from, I think he's

He grabs Sheila and pulls her down as GUNFIRE rakes the wall
behind them. Everybody else at the table hits the floor.
Other diners scream in terror.    Jelly pulls a GUN and SHOOTS

A LONE GUNMAN
runs from the restaurant. After a long beat, the frightened

          I don't know how you like your
          sausage? Twenty fuckin' years we been
          doin' this. So you got the money?
The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in
their faces.

                  (coughing, eyes
                   watering)
          Not all of it. I'm still light about
          fifteen large.
                  (blinded by smoke)
          Can we cut? This is ridiculous.
                         RAOUL (O.S.)
                  (shouts)
          Cut! Can you do something about the
          fucking smoke?

We PULL BACK to reveal the set of "Little Caesar." Assistant
directors and production assistants echo the director:
"We're cut!" "Reset!" "Effects!"
Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair,
still brooding over the previous night's events. Raoul sits
next to him.
                        RAOUL
                  (to Vitti)
          This is the problem with shooting on
          location. But it's worth it for the
          authenticity.

                        VITTI
          Yeah, this is real authentic.
                        RAOUL
                  (calls out)
          Tony! Come here a second.
                  (to Vitti)
          Anthony Bella. He plays Nicky Caesar.
                        VITTI
          I know who he is. They used to watch
          the show up at Sing Sing.
                        RAOUL
                  (delighted)
          Are you shitting me?
ANTHONY BELLA joins them.
                        RAOUL
          Tony, this is Paul Vitti.
                        TONY BELLA
                  (Australian accent)
          You don't have to tell me who he is.
                  (shakes Paul's hand)
          It's a pleasure, mate.

                     (reacting to accent)
            Mate? I don't believe this! You're
            an English guy? You ain't even
            Italian.
                          TONY BELLA
            Australian-Italian. We got some
            paisans down under.
                          VITTI
            Down under what?

                          RAOUL
                    (to Tony Bella)
            How incredible is this? Paul tells me
            they watch the show in Sing Sing!
                            TONY BELLA
            Fantastic!    That's so fuckin' great.
                          VITTI
            I wouldn't wet my pants over it.      They
            watch 'Supermarket Sweep,' too.
Raoul laughs hard.

                          VITTI
            You laugh too much.
                          TONY BELLA
            So, Paul, you going to join us?
Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form.
                            VITTI
            Yeah.    You got a good setup here.
                           TONY BELLA
            Great.   See you later then.
He exits.   Vitti turns to Raoul.
                          VITTI
            Coupla things, though. I don't know
            who makes these decisions, but some of
            this, it don't look right.
                          RAOUL
                    (concerned)
            I sensed it myself. Which elements
            strike you as wrong?
                          VITTI
            The people mainly. I mean, you got a
            boss who speaks Australian. What the
            fuck is that? And I'm guessing your

                                                            70.
          background is -- what?
                        RAOUL
          The theater, mostly.

                        VITTI
          Yeah, the theater. So how about if I
          bring in some guys that I know -- you
          know, more 'authentic.'
                         RAOUL
          I would be eternally grateful.
          Anything else?
                        VITTI
                  (thinks)
          Yeah. One of those trailers like the
          stars have.
                        RAOUL
                  (slight hesitation)
          Done.
                  (shakes his hand)
          I'll put that in the works right now.
He hurries off to talk to his assistant.   Jelly comes up to
Vitti.

                        JELLY
          You really gonna do this?
                        VITTI
          No fuckin' way. I've had it with this
          job bullshit. A week of this and I'd
          either shoot myself or shoot Raoul.
          But it's good cover while I figure out
          my next move. Call the guys.
                        JELLY

Ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and
a small prescription bag. Two Mafia SOLDIERS step up beside
him and urge him toward a big stretch LIMO IDLING at the
curb.

                        BEN
          There must be some mistake.    I didn't
          order a limo.

INT. KNIGHTS OF PALERMO - LATER
Ben enters timorously, still carrying his groceries.
Patty LoPresti, Masiello and a couple of other heavyweights
are sitting at the table, all except Patti smoking cigars.
Ben immediately recognizes their status and grasps the
gravity of their mood.
                         BEN
                   (nervous, but trying
                    to keep it light)
          Hello.   I'm Ben Sobel. And you are --
          ?

                                                           72.

The Soldier sits Ben down. The other soldier takes his
groceries. Ben looks at Patty, trying to gauge her role.

                        MASIELLO
          You're the shrink who's taking care of
          Paul Vitti?
                        BEN
          Yes, sir. That's right.
                  (to guy with
                   groceries)
          Could you be careful, because I think
          they put the eggs on the bottom.
He drops the bags heavily onto the bar.
                          MASIELLO
          So?    Is he nuts or what?
                          BEN
          Who?
                           MASIELLO
          Paulie.     Is he nuts?
                        BEN
          I can't discuss a patient's case with
          anyone --
                          MASIELLO
          Discuss it.
                        BEN
          I'd say he's still suffering from
          chronic anxiety and --
He hesitates.

          We call it Antisocial Personality
          Disorder. Sociopathy.
                          MASIELLO

          What are you saying?
                        BEN
          He's got a -- criminal temperament.

                        MASIELLO
                  (stares at him)
          He's a criminal? This is news? And
          for that you need a doctor
          degree? So what are you doin' with
          him?

                        BEN
          Well, I'm trying to at least show him
          the possibility of change --
                         PATTY
          Wrong.   You do not want him to change.
Ben looks at her, sensing her command of the group.
                        BEN
          We haven't really been
          introduced --
                        MASIELLO

Ben offers his hand but she ignores it.
                        PATTY
          Ben, Paul Vitti is important to this
          family. We don't want to see you turn
          him into a stromboni.
                        BEN
          A stromboni? That thing they clean
          the ice with at hockey games?
                        MASIELLO
          That's a Zamboni, asshole.   Stromboni.
                        PATTY
          It's a bull with his balls cut off.
She reaches under the table and grabs Ben's balls.    He winces
in pain.
                        BEN
                  (squeezed)
          No, we don't want to do that.

          A supernumerary. An 'atmosphere.' It
          ain't bad. You just stand around all
          day waitin' for them to shoot and they
          pay you eighty bucks.
                        PATTY
          Eighty bucks? For standin' around all
          day? You used to sneeze eighty bucks.
          How much you make shootin' craps?
                         JELLY
          Today?   About eight hundred maybe.

                        VITTI
          Nothing's going on.   They're actors.
                        PATTY
          Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're
          planning something. I'm feeling very
          left out.
                        VITTI
                  (quietly)
          Okay. Something big is going down,
          but you're getting a cut. My hand to
          God.

                                                           77.
                        PATTY
          You're a good friend, Paul. And I
          would never think of insisting on
          this, but I'd feel better if you
          brought in Eddie and some of my guys
          to help with the job.
                        VITTI
          I don't think so.
                        PATTY
          Then I'll have to insist.

                         VITTI
          Whatever.
Raoul approaches and eyes Patty disdainfully.
                        RAOUL
          Oh, dear God. First of all,
          sweetheart, we're not shooting the
          hooker scene until tomorrow. And the
          hair -- please, what is that?
                         PATTY
          Excuse me?

                        VITTI
          Raoul, this is a friend of mine.
          Patty LoPresti.
Raoul freezes, recognizing the name.
                        RAOUL
          Mrs. LoPresti -- I am so very, very
Raoul wheels on a production assistant who happens to be
passing by.
                        RAOUL
          How dare you not inform me Mrs.
          LoPresti was on the set. You're
          fired!
                  (to Patty)
          Enjoy your visit with us. If there's
          anything I can do --
                        PATTY
          Go fuck yourself.
                         RAOUL
          Immediately.
Raoul moves away quickly.   Patty turns back to Vitti.
                        PATTY
          It's good to have you back, Paul.

                                                               78.
                     (kisses Vitti on
                      the cheek)
             We'll be in touch.

She exits.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
As Patty and her men walk away down one aisle of trucks and
campers, Rigazzi and his men walk down the next aisle heading
for the set.
They narrowly miss seeing each other.

EXT. BASE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER
Ben arrives looking for Vitti. He       sees Patty approaching and
freezes, then quickly ducks behind      a nearby truck, shielding
his crotch. Patty and her men pass       by. Ben waits until they
pass, then comes out of hiding and      hurries on.

A mildly-distraught Raoul is huddled with Vitti.

             I mean, tell me -- was she angry?    Am
             I in any danger?
                           VITTI
             No, you're fine. But you might want
             to have somebody else start your car
             the next couple of weeks.
                           RAOUL
             I'll have Brian do it.   He's new.
Rigazzi and his men join them.
                           RIGAZZI
                     (to Vitti)
             Could I talk to you for a second?
                           RAOUL
                     (eyeing Rigazzi)
             Oh, what is this now, the bus and
             truck tour of Guys and Dolls?
                           VITTI
             This is Lou Rigazzi.

                                                             79.
Raoul freezes.

                  (a horrified whisper)
          'The Wrench.'
                         RAOUL (CONT'D)
                  (taking Rigazzi's
                   hand)
          Please, forgive me. I'm on
          painkillers -- half the time I don't
          know what I'm saying.

Raoul kisses Rigazzi's hand.     Rigazzi yanks it away.
                         RIGAZZI
          Get lost.
                        RAOUL
          Certainly.
                  (as he exits)
          Brian! Get my car!
                        RIGAZZI
                  (to Vitti)
          I need a couple minutes.

                        VITTI
                  (nodding)
          This way.

EXT. CRAFT SERVICES TABLE - MOMENTS LATER
Vitti and Rigazzi stand at the table.     Rigazzi's soldiers are
nearby.
                        RIGAZZI
          The guy who shot at you -- he was
          acting on his own. I never gave an
          order.
                         VITTI
          Is that right?
                        RIGAZZI
          And he's been taken care of. There
          won't be another incident. Unless
          you're thinkin' of workin' for Patty
          LoPresti.
                         VITTI
          Me?    No.
                          RIGAZZI
          Good.    Then I got no beef with you.

                                                             80.

                          VITTI
          Thanks.    I'll sleep much better.

                          RIGAZZI
          Because   that would not be the way to
          go. You    want to back a winner, which
          is gonna   be me. It only makes sense.
          You come   work for us. I'll treat you
          right.
                        VITTI
          I don't think so.
                        RIGAZZI
                  (a beat)
          Well, so much for sleeping better.
Rigazzi smiles and pats Vitti's cheek, then exits with his
soldiers.

          How's it going?
                        MO-MO
          Goin' good. I did a 'Law and Order'

          the City' --
                        TUNA
          I'm up for a recurring on 'NYPD Blue.'

There's a loud KNOCK on the door and Ben storms in.

                  (surprised to see him)
          Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?

                          BEN
          No, what are   you doing here? I came
          to tell you   we have a preliminary
          meeting with   your parole officer and
          who do I run   into? Patty LoPresti.
                          VITTI
          Patty who?
                        BEN
          What is this -- a knock-knock joke?
          Patty-who-kidnapped-me-and-threatened-
          to-cut-off-my-balls. Stop lying to
          me, Paul. Your whole gang is here.

                        VITTI
          Who says I'm lying? I finally    get a
          straight job and start putting   my life
          in order and you come in here   and
          start accusing me! That's how    much
          you trust me?
                          BEN
                  (off   balance)
          It's not that   I don't trust you, I
          just don't --   trust you.   Are you
          lying to me?    Because I know you,
          Paul. You'll    say or do anything to
          get your own   way.
                        VITTI
          This is what's so hard about being an
          ex-con. You make one little mistake
          in your life and people never let you
          forget it.
                        BEN
          Oh, so now you're the victim?    I want

          you did just now.

          I want the truth?
                        VITTI
          No, strong, like before.

                        BEN
                  (forceful)

          No, I'm serious. That had power. I
          believed it. You could be an actor.

          I'm not an actor --

          Hey, you're as good as most of the
          bums I see around here. They have
          this part. You could do it.
                        BEN
          Actually, I did The Music Man in tenth
          grade.
                         VITTI
          Of course.   I'm gonna talk to Raoul.

             harness or anything. They could have
             dropped me.

             I know exactly what that was about.
             You resent the fact that you've been
             put in my custody, so you passive-
             aggressively arranged things to make
             me look like a fool.

             Really? I was scared at first, but on

             good stuff. I was able to texture the
             screaming --

          What, are you self-medicating again?
          And don't give that decongestant
          multi-vitamin bullshit.

                        BEN
          Don't worry about me. Just worry
          about what you're going to say to this
          parole officer. What are you going to
          say? That you've moved out of my
          house. That you've got your old gang
          back together. For what, a high

           No, they're two cars back. You gotta
           be a little more observant, Doc. Turn
           left.
Ben executes a hard, SKIDDING left.   The Benz stays right
with him.
                         BEN
           What if we just stop and get out?
           They're not going to shoot us in broad
           daylight.

           Broad daylight's the best time. You
           can see better. Take a right. Now!

big splash and starts to sink almost immediately.

          Well, considering that he's in your
          custody, that's not quite the answer I
          was looking for. He's got something
          big in the works. You want to tell me
          what you know?
                        BEN
          I don't know anything. As far as I

          Yeah, that's why I've got two corpses

He reaches through the open car window into his briefcase and
pulls out a file of photographs.

          to felony manslaughter. And trust me,
          Dr. Sobel, if you don't like me now,

                        MICHAEL
          You keep telling me to get a job!
                        BEN
          I meant making sandwiches at the
          Subway, not driving a getaway car!
                        MICHAEL
          He's paying me twenty dollars an hour.
                        BEN
          I don't care if he pays you two
          hundred an hour, you're not doing it.
                        MICHAEL
          Dad --
                        BEN
          He had no right to ask you without my
          permission. Where is he?
                        MICHAEL
          I can't tell you.
                        BEN
          What do you mean you can't tell me?

                                                       95.

                           MICHAEL
             I promised I'd never repeat anything I
             heard in the car. I took an oath.

                           BEN
             You took an oath! Oh, my God!     Was
             there blood involved?
                           MICHAEL
             Dad, I gave my word.

Laura comes out of the house.
                           LAURA
             Ben? Where've you been?    What
             happened to you?
                            BEN
                      (minimizing)
             I was  in a car chase. There  was a
             little  shooting -- not that much
             really  -- then they -- drove into the
             river.   It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
                           LAURA
             When is this going to end?

                           BEN
             Tonight, I hope. I just have to find
             him and --
                           LAURA
             Why? A few days ago you weren't even
             sure you still wanted to be a
             therapist. Now you're going to risk
             your life again for that lout.
                           BEN
             Yeah, but he's an amazing lout, isn't
             he? I can't quit now. You know that.
                            LAURA
                      (relents)
             Go.   Just don't get shot -- please?
                            BEN
             I love you.
They kiss.     Then Ben turns to Michael.
                           BEN
             All right, where is he?
                            MICHAEL
             I can't.

                                                             96.
                         LAURA
                  (pops)
          You tell your father right now or I'll
          give you such a smack it won't even be
          funny!
                         MICHAEL
                   (surprised)
          Okay!   I dropped him at the club.
                          BEN
          What club?

                        MICHAEL
          Little Darling's in Queens.
                        BEN
          Okay, Mafiaboy, give me your car keys.
                          MICHAEL
          I'm grounded?
                        BEN
          No, I'm borrowing your car.
He kisses Laura again and takes off.

                                               CUT TO:
EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - LATER THAT NIGHT
Several limos are parked outside a family-owned nightclub in
Queens.
Ben pulls up, leaning way back in the driver's seat of
Michael's, half-painted, modified '82 Honda Civic with the
BUBBLING MUFFLERS.
                                               CUT TO:
INT. CIVIC - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Ben takes out a bottle of pills. He tries to remove the
child-safety cap but his hands are shaking so badly he can't
do it. Frustrated, he tries to bite the cap off, then gives
up and throws the bottle away.

EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - SAME TIME
Ben enters the club.
A moment later, Cerrone and Miller cruise by in an unmarked
car and park at the end of the block.

                                                             97.
                                                 CUT TO:
INT. CLUB ENTRANCE - MOMENT LATER

Ben enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd,
looking for Vitti.
He pushes through and sees Jelly and a few of the guys
watching an exotic dancer, a beautiful young blonde in a
skimpy costume, standing on a platform grinding in mock
ecstasy.

                          BEN
          Jelly!
                        JELLY
                  (yelling over music)
          Hey, Doc. What are you doin' here?
                          BEN
          Where's Paul?
Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string.     She looks at Ben
and winks suggestively.
                        JELLY
          I think she likes you, Doc.     Give her
          a couple of bucks.
Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to
the stripper.
                        BEN
          Can you break a twenty?
The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and
Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it.
                        BEN
          Do I just make my own change?
He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string
but she dances away.
                        BEN
                  (calls to her)
          A ten and five ones -- when you have
          the chance.
He turns around to talk to Jelly, but he's already gone.
Ben finds Jelly at a table with Vitti.
                        BEN
          Okay, Paul, what's going on?

                                                           98.

                        VITTI
                  (keyed up)
          What are you doing here?

                        BEN
          I could ask you the same thing.
                        VITTI
          What's it look like? We're just
          blowin' off a little steam. What's
          the big deal?

Eddie DeVol enters, flanked by his main guys, AL PACINO and
ENORMOUS BOBBY.
                        EDDIE
          How's it goin', Paulie? You know my
          guys -- Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?
                        VITTI
                  (looks at him)
          Al Pacino? That's your real name?
                         AL PACINO
          No. People call me that because I
          look like Al Pacino.
                  (beat)
          The actor.
                        VITTI
          Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?
                        AL PACINO
          No.   Why?
                        VITTI
          'Cause you look about as much like
          Carol Burnett as you look like Al
          Pacino.
Ben laughs.   Al Pacino glares at him.
                        BEN
          I do see a little Pacino there --
          around the eyes.
                        EDDIE
          So we're all here. Let's do it.
He heads for the back of the club with his guys.   Vitti and
Jelly start to follow.
                         BEN
                  (stops Vitti)
          Let's do what?

                                                          99.
                        VITTI
          You better get out of here.
                         BEN
                  (lays a hand
                   on his arm)
          I'm not going until you tell me what's
          going on here.
Vitti violently shakes off Ben's hand.
                        VITTI
                  (menacing)
          Don't make me hurt you.    Get the fuck
          out of here.
He walks away leaving Ben frozen.
Ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the
back of the club. He starts toward the door.
                                                CUT TO:
INT. BASEMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled
room. Jelly sits at  his side. He's surrounded by his crew,
about a half-a-dozen guys, and Patty's man, Eddie DeVol.
Several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table.
                        VITTI
          Okay, this is big and we only get one
          shot at it; and there's only about a
          million ways this fuckin' thing can go
          bad, so listen up.
Vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps
a spot downtown.
                        VITTI
          The Federal Gold Depository in Lower
          Manhattan. Three times a year a
          shipment of gold bars goes in a
          heavily-guarded armored truck from the
          Depository to the vault at the Federal
          Reserve to hold for foreign
          governments that trade in bullion. At
          three o'clock in the morning -- eight
          hours from now --we're gonna hijack
          that truck.

INT. LITTLE DARLING'S - SAME TIME
Ben enters the back room of the club, looks around, and
starts down the stairwell leading to the basement.

INT. BASEMENT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ben makes his way down the cramped, dimly-lit stairway and
approaches the door to the basement room.
He raises his hand to knock, then hesitates and stands there
for a moment listening to the MUFFLED VOICES inside.
Suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the
door by Enormous Bobby. Bobby slams him against the door a
couple of more times, using Ben's head as a doorknocker. The
door is opened by someone inside and Enormous Bobby shoves
Ben into the room.

INT. BASEMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Ben hits the floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from
the guys. Enormous Bobby pulls Ben off the floor by his
lapels.
                        EDDIE
          What the fuck is this?

                        ENORMOUS BOBBY
          I found this guy listening at the
          door.
                        BEN
                  (dazed)
          Hey, guys. How's it going?
                        EDDIE
          Who is this guy?
                         BEN
                  (not looking
                   at Eddie)
          Ben Sobel. Sorry, I can't move my
          head to the right. Boy, I hope that's
          not permanent.
                        EDDIE
          Get rid of him.
Al Pacino puts his gun to Ben's head.
                        BEN
                  (still dazed)
          Hi, Carol.
                        AL PACINO
          You're a dead man, asshole.    Let's go.

He starts muscling Ben to the door.
                        VITTI
          What are you doing?

                        EDDIE
          What do you think? He can make every
          guy in this room.
                        BEN
          Oh, I'm not into that, fellas.

                        VITTI
          Get your fuckin' hands off him!   He's
          with me.
                        EDDIE
          What, on the job?
Vitti hesitates.
                        EDDIE
                  (impatiently)
          Either he's in, or he's dead.    Which
          is it?
                        BEN
          I think in is better.
                        VITTI
                  (reluctantly)
          He's in. He's my responsibility.
                        EDDIE
                  (to Vitti)
          Okay, no more surprises. And from
          this moment on, no one leaves my
          sight. Got it? Now go through it one
          more time.
                        VITTI
          Okay -- everybody listen up.
                         BEN
          Wait!
                    (sits)
          Okay.    Go ahead.

A dozen men looking like Vitti and his crew come out of the
club and get into the limos.

                          MILLER (O.S.)
            Everybody stand by. They're leaving.
The limos drive off.
At the corner, the FBI car pulls out and follows at a

Ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt,
struggling to lace his work boots. Jelly approaches him and
tosses a bulletproof vest on the table.

          Watch it. It may be crazy but it
          ain't stupid. If you want to stay
          alive, just keep your mouth shut, do
          everything I tell you and try not to
          pee in your pants.
                  (quietly)
          Can you handle an M-16?
He holds up an automatic rifle.
                        BEN
          You mean shoot it?
                        JELLY
          No, I mean twirl it like a fuckin'
          baton. How about an A.K.?

                                                            104.

He holds up another rifle.

                  (rummaging through
                   pile)
          Kalashnikov, MAC-10, Uzi -- stop me if
          I hit one you like.

Ben sees Eddie watching him and gingerly picks up a 9mm
handgun.
                        BEN
          Couldn't I just take this?
                        JELLY
          Yeah, that's a good one. That gun
          brings back a lot of fond memories.
          Use it in good health.
Ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees, but it
slips through and drops into his pants.

                        BEN
                  (winces)
          Ooh, cold -- cold.
He jams his hand down the front of his pants and starts
searching around in there. Eddie and Enormous Bobby stare at
him as they walk by.
                        BEN
                  (explaining)
          My gun -- fell down in my --
He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and
clatters onto the floor. He smiles weakly and picks it up.
Vitti approaches.    He looks agitated but under tight control.
                         VITTI
                  (to Jelly)
          Check the bus.
Jelly exits.
                        VITTI
                  (quietly, to   Ben)
          If we can, I'm gonna   get you out
          before the real shit   goes down. Just
          don't flip out on me,   okay?

                                                             105.
                          BEN
            You are making a huge mistake.   You
            know that, don't you?

                          VITTI
            You said it yourself.   It's my nature.
                          BEN
            It's not your nature!   You have a
            choice.
                          VITTI
            What are you, fucking Jiminy Cricket?
            I don't know what planet you live on,
            but here on Earth it's 'might makes
            right.'   Read the papers. The guys
            with the guns make the rules.
                          BEN
                    (holding up the
                     pistol)
            So I guess that makes me a real man
            now.  What happened to the white hat,
            Paul?  Your father wasn't wrong. You
            could be one of the good guys.
                          VITTI
            Enough. Say one more word about my
            father and I'll break your fuckin'
            head.
                          BEN
                    (quietly)
            Okay.
Vitti walks off.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME
Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic
attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to
stifle his panic. Then he sees his tortured face in the
mirror and starts pulling himself together.
                                                   CUT TO:
INT. WAREHOUSE - FEW MINUTES LATER
The guys are getting into the trucks. Ben keeps letting
everybody go in front of him, then starts to back away, but
Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind him and push him up
into the truck.

The big doors open and two trucks roll out carrying Vitti,
Ben and the crew.

INT. LEAD TRUCK - SAME TIME
The guys are sitting on the floor in the back of the truck,
lined up along the sides like paratroopers waiting to jump.
Ben is sitting next to Jelly and across from Vitti who is
just staring intently.

heading downtown.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (LATER)
Vitti, Ben, and Eddie DeVol stand next to the treads of a
giant crane.
                        VITTI
                  (checks his watch)
          I have five to three. They should
          start movin' any minute.
                        BEN
                  (looking at his watch)
          I have three-o-six.
                        VITTI
          Let's see your watch.

Ben slips it off and hands it to him. Vitti smashes it on a
rock with the butt of his gun, then tosses it back to Ben.
Vitti's RADIO SQUAWKS and the spotter's voice is heard.
                        SPOTTER (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          They're moving!
Vitti keys his radio twice as a signal and holds up his
clenched fist to alert the guys on site with him.
                                                CUT TO:
EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - NIGHT
A CONVOY of vehicles emerges from the bowels of the building
and turns onto the street. In front and back are specially-
equipped SUVs, full of heavily-armed federal marshals; an
armored truck in the middle carries the gold.

                                                          107.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SAME TIME

The convoy RUMBLES past a block-long, high-rise construction
site, totally enclosed by a plywood wall around the
perimeter.
VITTI
He can hear the convoy passing outside the wall.

SPOTTER
He looks down on the convoy from a vantage point on a
scaffold high above the street. When the trucks are in the
right position, he waves to Vitti on the ground.
VITTI
sees the signal.
                         VITTI
                   (on walkie)
          Go!
                                              CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A forty-foot, flat-bed trailer truck loaded with cement
conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path
of the convoy.
The lead SUV HONKS. The truck doesn't move. The CAPTAIN of
the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck. The driver
has slipped out the other side and disappeared.
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes
around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points
crunching into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising
off the pavement. A couple of determined marshals jump out
of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the
armored truck is lifted off the ground.
                                              CUT TO:
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up. The
marshals hang on as long as they can, then prudently let go
and drop heavily to the street. Two marshals are still
clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet,
then swings silently over the perimeter fencing.

                                                             108.
INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE
A bank of arc lights is switched on illuminating the site as
the truck is lowered to the ground. Heavily-armed gangsters
in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver, the
shotgun guard and the frightened marshals
into a construction shack, while men with acetylene torches
attack the back doors.
Vitti pulls down his ski mask and taps Ben.
                        BEN
          Paul, it's not too late.   Don't do
          this.
                          VITTI
          Let's go.
He strides off to take charge. Ben pulls down his mask and
hurries after him, but runs right into a pole.
                          BEN
          Shit!   Ow!
He raises his mask and scampers after Vitti rubbing the
painful bump on his forehead.

                                                CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
The marshals run around, frantically searching for a way into
the construction site.
                                                CUT TO:

VITTI
Totally in charge, he strides up to the armored truck just as
his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors. Vitti
yanks the doors open..
Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the
truck -- a fortune in gold bars.
                        VITTI
                  (shouts)
          Get the ramp!
Eddie and his guys run up with a long, narrow track with
metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck.
                        EDDIE
                  (very excited)
          You know, this might just fuckin'
          work.

                                                          109.
                        BEN
          You're gonna get in so much trouble.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
The marshals are trying to climb over the construction site
wall, but they're stopped by rolls of razor wire and
SUPPRESSING FIRE from inside the site.
                        LIEUTENANT
          They can't get over the wire.
                        CAPTAIN
          Then knock down the gates!
                                               CUT TO:
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE
The guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run
them quickly along the rolling track into the bus.
                                               CUT TO:

INT. BUS - SAME TIME
Jelly is pulling on the hat and jacket of a transit authority
bus driver. The floor boards of the bus have been lifted out
and the guys are laying the gold bars in the hollow under the
floor.
                        VITTI
                  (pops his head in)
          Forty bars. That's all we need.

                        BEN
          How much is that?
                        VITTI
          $350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound,
          90 pounds in each bar -- do the math.
                        JELLY
                  (a beat)
          Actually, gold is measured in troy
          ounces. 14.6 ounces to the pound.
          That would be... $18,396,000.
                          BEN
          Really?
                          JELLY
          Give or take.
He hears a LOUD CRASH and all eyes turn to the gates.

                                                             110.
                        BEN
          Well, so much for not peeing in my
          pants.

Eddie goes off to help transfer the gold.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
The marshals back up one of the SUVs and run it into the
gates again.

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE
The big, wooden GATES SHUDDER but Vitti's men roll two
enormous earthmovers up to reinforce the gates.
                        BEN
          You know what you said about not
          flipping out?
                          VITTI
          Yeah?

                          BEN
          Sorry.
                  (flipping out)
          What did I do? What did I do? I had
          a perfect life, I threw it away.
                          VITTI
          Don't do this.
Vitti drags him off toward the building structure.
                        BEN
          I can't help it! My life is over!
          I'm going to jail. Some people
          can handle prison -- I'm not one of
          them. I have delicate features. I'm
          small. I'll be way too popular!
                          VITTI
          Calm down.
                        BEN
          I can't calm down!      I'm gonna die!
Inside the structure, Vitti spins him around and shakes him.
                        VITTI
          You're not gonna die!

                                                                111.
                        BEN
          I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!
                        VITTI
                  (shaking him)
          For Chrissake, get hold of yourself!
                         BEN
          I can't!   I'm dying!   We're all going
          to die!
Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face.      They both
freeze.
                        BEN
          Did I just hit you?
                         VITTI
          Yeah.   Feel better now?
                        BEN
                  (breaking down)
          I'm sorry, Paul. I blame myself for
          this. I wanted to help you. I wanted
          to be there for you. But I just
          wasn't good enough.

                        VITTI
          You were good.  It isn't your fault.
                        BEN
          No, it is. Since my father
          died --
                  (starts crying)
          I've lost my way. I don't know
          anything anymore. I mean, what's the
          point? I didn't think it would hit me
          so hard --
                        VITTI
          Would you just shut up about your
          father!
                        BEN
          I'm grieving, goddammit!    Have a
          little respect!
                        VITTI
          He was an asshole -- you said it
          yourself. What are you grieving for?
                        BEN
          I'm grieving for myself, you fucking
          idiot!
Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain.

                                                          112.
                        VITTI
                  (surprised, shrugs)
          Jeez, I'm sorry.

                        BEN
          Now I know how you must have felt when
          your father was killed.
Vitti looks at him.
                        BEN
                  (crying more)
          I mean, it had to be ten times worse
          for you -- being murdered right in
          front of you. And you were so young -
          -
                        VITTI
          We don't have time for this.
                        BEN
                  (really sobbing)
          It must've been so painful!
                        VITTI
                  (eyes filling with
                   tears)
          I'm warning you -- don't do
          this --
                        BEN
          I mean, it's like all his hopes for
          you died with him. And that's so sad.
                        VITTI
                  (starting to cry)
          There I go. You happy now?      You see
          what you're doing here?
Both men are crying now.
                        BEN
          Your father really loved you.
                        VITTI
          I loved him, too. I did.
                        BEN
                  (hugs him)
          I know. I know.
Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy
embrace.
                          JELLY
          Oh, boy.    This is bad.

                                                          113.
Another huge CRASH as the marshals ram the gates again, this
time tearing loose one of the big hinges.
                        JELLY
          Maybe we oughta should go.
Vitti, Ben and Jelly run to the bus, but Eddie pulls a gun
and stops them. Al and Bobby cover Jelly and the rest of the
crew. Vitti backs away slowly.
                        EDDIE
          Did you really think you were gonna
          live through this?
                        VITTI
          I had my hopes.
                        EDDIE
          Yeah, well, nice work.   Mr. Rigazzi
          will be very grateful.
                        BEN
                  (to Vitti)
          Rigazzi? I thought he worked for
          Patti LoPresti.
                        VITTI
          That's what Patty thought, too. This
          scumbag's been playin' both sides
          against the middle.
                        EDDIE
          There's only one side as far as I'm
          concerned. Mine. What did you think?
          I was just gonna stand by and let some
          fuckin' has-been move back in? So
          long, Mr. Vitti.
He cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when Ben
suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun. Vitti
and Jelly quickly cover Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby.
                        BEN
                  (beating the shit
                   out of Eddie)
          I can't take it anymore! That's what
          I hate about you fucking sociopaths!
          You just keep changing the rules to
          suit yourselves. Well, not this time,
          you anti-social asshole. You fucked
          with the wrong shrink!
Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's
nose.
                        BEN
          Don't you read the papers?   The guy

                                                               114.
             with the gun makes the rules.
                           VITTI
             Yeah, what?

They shove Eddie, Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino into the back
of the armored truck, Vitti gives a signal and the crane
lifts it off the ground.
                                                     CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The armored truck comes down fast and drops heavily to the
street. Federal MARSHALS swarm the truck and find Eddie, Al,
and Bobby sprawled in the back.
                           CAPTAIN
                     (screaming)
             On the floor! Face-down!   Now!
                           AL PACINO
                     (to Eddie)
             Nice goin'. Good plan.
                           ENORMOUS BOBBY
             What's a sociopath?

The marshals handcuff them.
Suddenly, the marshals hear AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE coming
from the next block.
Uniformed SWAT COPS come running from that direction and
shout to the marshals.
                           SWAT LEADER
             They're escaping out the back!    Get
             over there! Move it!
The marshals rush toward the sound of the GUNFIRE and
disappear around the corner.
                                              CUT TO:
NEXT BLOCK
As the marshals round the corner, they see a police shoot-out
in progress.
Wiseguys are FIRING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at cops who are pinned
down behind police cruisers.
The Captain of the marshals FIRES a warning SHOT in the air.
                           CAPTAIN
                     (on a bullhorn)
             Freeze! Drop your weapons!

                                                             115.

The head wiseguy, Anthony Bella, turns in surprise.
                        TONY BELLA
          What the hell is this?
                        RAOUL (O.S.)
                  (on his own bullhorn)
          Cut, cut, cut! What the hell's going
          on?
Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking
through his bullhorn.
                        RAOUL
                  (to the Captain)
          Who are you? What are you doing in my
          shot?
The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're
on the set of "Little Caesar."
                        CAPTAIN
          What are you doing on my street?
The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to
face, shouting at each other through their BULLHORNS.

                        RAOUL
          I have a permit!
                        CAPTAIN
          I don't give a shit about your permit!
The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR addresses the TV crew.
                        ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
          All right, people. Back to one and
          let's try it again!
                  (into his walkie-talkie)
          Release the traffic and reset for
          another take.
On the perimeters of the set, the PA's signal the off-duty
cops who work the set to release the real traffic they've
been holding on the cross streets.
A city bus passes behind Raoul and Tony Bella who are still
screaming at the Federal Marshal.
                                                CUT TO:
EXT. 11TH AVENUE - MINUTES LATER
In mid-block, SWAT cops step into the street and wave the bus
to a halt.

                                                               116.

INT. BUS - SAME TIME

Ben is sitting in the back with Vitti as the helmeted SWAT
cops board the bus.
                        BEN
                  (sees them coming)
          That's it. We're screwed.
The cops walk toward the back and confront Ben.

                           LEAD SWAT
          You!
                           BEN
          Yes, Officer?
                        LEAD SWAT
          You're one tough shrink.
The cops unmask. It's Mo-Mo, Cokes, and Tuna.     They laugh
and slap hands with Vitti and Ben.
                                               CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The bus pulls out and joins the flow of traffic heading
downtown.
                                               CUT TO:
INT. BUS - MINUTES LATER
All the guys are looking pretty happy with their score.
Ben turns to Vitti.
                        BEN
          Feeling pretty good, huh?
                           VITTI
          I felt worse.
                        BEN
          So what now? You go on the run for
          the rest of your life? Back to Sing
          Sing? Or you turn up dead in an alley?
                        VITTI
          Those are my choices? What   happened
          to lying on a beach in Costa  Rica
          for the next twenty years?   You
          can't let me enjoy this for  five
          fuckin' minutes?

                                                             117.

                          BEN
          Five minutes?    And then what?

                          VITTI
          And then what?    I'll show you.

EXT. RIGAZZI PLUMBING AND HEATING - NEXT MORNING
A Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of FBI agents led
by Agent Miller. Stacked inside are forty gold bars.
Agent Cerrone comes out of the building with Lou Rigazzi and
several associates in handcuffs.
U.S. Attorney Chapin makes a statement to the media.
                        CHAPIN
          Acting on intelligence we developed in
          the last few days, the Justice
          Department and the F.B.I. took very
          aggressive action to recover the
          stolen gold and bring the perpetrators
          to justice. I'm happy to tell the
          people of New York that the streets
          are safe again.
                                               CUT TO:
EXT. PATTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
Vitti knocks on the front door.    Patty answers it in her
robe.
                         PATTY
          Hi, Paul.   How'd it go?
                          VITTI
          Not so good.
                        PATTY
          Yeah, I heard. It's all over the
          television. I never should've trusted
          Eddie. But, you know, a woman alone
          in the world is very vulnerable.
                          VITTI
          Yeah, I know.
                        PATTY
          At least I don't have to worry about
          the Rigazzis no more. Thanks to you.
                        VITTI
          I told you -- I just want to be left

                                                          118.
          alone.
                        PATTY
          I know. I'll make sure. How about
          some breakfast? I could make you some
          waffles and -- whatever else you want.
She adjusts her robe, providing Vitti a quick peek.
                        VITTI
          Can't do that.

Patty smiles and shrugs.
                        PATTY
          Well, if you ever change your mind --
                  (kisses him)
          Good luck, Paul.
                                              CUT TO:
EXT. EAST RIVER BOARDWALK - LATER MORNING
Ben is leaning against the railing gazing at the water when
Vitti walks up.
                        BEN
          Did you see Patti?

                        VITTI
          Yeah.
                        BEN
                  (ruefully)
          Did she grab your balls?
                        VITTI
          What kind of question is that? She's
          cool. She's just happy to have 'the
          Wrench' out of the way.
                        BEN
          Well, I talked to the U.S. Attorney.
                        VITTI
          Did he grab your balls?
                        BEN
          No, Paul, he did not grab my balls.
          He thanked me for tipping him off
          about the gold. And he said he won't
          be coming after you if you stay out of
          trouble.  So what do you think?
                        VITTI
          I'm gonna go to Ohio -- get Marie and
          the kids -- then we'll probably
          disappear for awhile -- figure out all

                                                    119.
          this future stuff
          -- away from all the pressure.
                        BEN
          Good idea. Change is hard, Paul.    But
          you did the right thing.
                        VITTI
          Yeah, you, too. You hung in there.
          That took a lot of guts.
                        BEN
          Well, I just --
                        VITTI
          No, you were like an animal back
          there.
                        BEN
          I just vented my displaced aggression
                       VITTI
          No. I'm telling you. You're a
          monster. I saw the beast in you.
                        BEN
          I'm not a beast. I can handle myself
          if I have to --
                        VITTI
          Handle yourself? You were fuckin'
          John Wayne.
                         BEN
          Well, I wrestled a bit in high school
          -- 122 pounds.
                        VITTI
          Yeah, I could tell.   You're good, you.
                        BEN
          I'm not --
                        VITTI
          Paul, I just --
                       VITTI
          No. You are good. You got a gift, my
          friend.
Ben gives up.
                         BEN
          Fine.   I have a gift.
                        VITTI
          So -- happy ending, huh?

                                                             120.

                        BEN
          Well, I think so.   Don't you feel
          better now?

                        VITTI
          Are you kidding? I feel like shit.
          All that work for nothing. 20 million
          bucks.
                        BEN
          You're grieving -- it's a process.

                        VITTI
          Take it easy, Doc.
                        BEN
          You, too, Paul.
They embrace. Then Vitti starts to walk away toward Jelly
who has been waiting at a respectful distance.
Vitti stops and turns.
                        VITTI
          Hey, Doc!
                  (sings)

    DOMINIC MANETTA

    a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE
    of related news photos.

                            MANETTA (V.O.)
              1957 was a big year. The Russians
              put that Sputnik into outer space,
              the Dodgers played their last game
              at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
              Frank Costello in the head, and
              missed, and the Gallo brothers
              whacked Albert Anastasia in that
              barber shop in the Park Sheraton
              Hotel. It was total chaos. With
              Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese
              figures he's king shit, but Carlo
              Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both
              want to be boss of all bosses. So
              they call a meeting -- a big
              meeting.


2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2

    CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
    see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
    top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
    through the peaceful landscape.

                            MANETTA (V.O.)
              It was the first time the whole
              commission was ever gonna meet
              face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
              were comin' in from all over the
              country, and all the New York
              families, too -- maybe sixty
              bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
              all headin' toward this little
              town upstate to figure out what's
              what.


3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3

    A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black
    Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,

              Your father and me, we were goin'

                 He was running the family at the
                 time. Anyway, I don't know what
                 anybody was thinking, but some
                 asshole thought it would be a good
                 idea to have this meeting at Joe
                 Babara's farm in the country where
                 nobody would notice.


4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4

    A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
    when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
    up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.

                               MANETTA (V.O.)
                 Turns out the local cops were
                 watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
                 So now you got about fifty Caddies
                 and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
                 and some deputy sheriff with cow
                 shit on his shoes notices all the
                 traffic and calls the Feds.


5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5

    The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
    country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
    greeting each other on the big front porch.

    One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.

                               WISEGUY
                 You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away
                 from the fuckin' car.


6   EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME                                        6

    Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed,
    wearing big FBI arm bands.

                               MANETTA (V.O.)
                 The meeting never even got
                 started. The Feds moved in --


7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              7

    Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start
    breaking down the front door.

                                                              3.

8    EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SAME TIME                                  8

                             MANETTA (V.O.)
               -- and we moved out.

     Gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows
     and leaping off balconies.


     WIDE - WISEGUYS

     fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields.

                             MANETTA (V.O.)
               Your papa and me hid in a field
               with hay or corn, some kinda
               foliage, I don't know.


9    EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY                                           9

     Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass.
     Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on
     them.

                             MANETTA (V.O.)
               Then along comes this farmer who
               almost runs us over in a tractor,
               so your father hauls out his piece,
               this .44 cannon he used to carry,
               and hijacks the goddamn tractor.
               Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.


10   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         10

     The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two
     wiseguys drive off on it.

     The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a
     swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN.

     END CREDITS.

     INT. RITZ CLAM BOX - LATE AFTERNOON (PRESENT)

     The place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL
     VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late
     forties, and a powerful boss in his own right.

                                MANETTA
                  Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of
                  it capo de tutti capi, and that
                  was the last time the whole
                  commission tried to meet -- until
                  now.

                                VITTI
                         (brooding)
                  I don't know. I don't like it.
                  What do we need a meeting for?
                  Let everybody worry about their
                  own business.

     They finish eating.

                                MANETTA
                  The '57 meeting was about how we
                  were going to divide up the whole
                  country. This meeting is about
                  how we're gonna survive. You got
                  'made' guys informing for the
                  Feds; bosses going to jail;
                  everybody's dealing drugs; people
                  are getting whacked without
                  permission. And on top of
                  everything, now we got the Chinese
                  Triads and these crazy Russians to
                  deal with. Everything's changing.
                  We need a leader. Someone with
                  fresh ideas. Someone like you.
                  It's gonna be a new century, Paul.
                  We gotta change with the times.

                                VITTI
                  What are we gonna get, a fuckin'
                  web site?

                                MANETTA
                  You remember what else happened in
                  1957, Paul?

                                VITTI
                  Yeah, I remember.

                                MANETTA
                  When your father died, I promised
                  him I'd always look out for you.
                  Come to the meeting.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

     They get up to leave. Vitti drops some money on the
     table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters
     and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost
     out the door when Vitti hesitates.

                                VITTI
                  Wait a second. I'm just gonna
                  grab a toothpick.

     The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his
     bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE,
     which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS.

     Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind
     the counter, shielding him with his body.

     Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders
     are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up
     with tears.

     early thirties, dabs at her eyes with the tissue. She's
     sitting on the couch in --

     The office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated.

                         (weepy)
                  I kept telling him that I needed
                  room to grow and find myself as a
                  person. Not just as a woman but
                  as an independent entity.

     BEN SOBOL

     her therapist, seems to be listening intently.

                                CAROLINE
                  I told him I needed to get in
                  touch with my uniqueness, but he
                  couldn't handle that. He said I
                  was driving him away. Do you
                  think I was driving him away, Dr.
                  Sobol?

     Ben leans forward sympathetically.

     He's in his mid-forties, has an expressive face and a
     quick wit, and despite the occasional lapse, he is a
     gifted and caring psychologist.

                  Things end, Caroline. That's just
                  a part of life. It's how we deal
                  with things ending that's important.

                                CAROLINE
                  I just can't believe it's over between
                  me and Steve. Maybe there's still
                  hope.

                                BEN
                  Well, he did take out a restraining
                  order against you. I have to be
                  honest, that's usually not a good
                  sign.

                                CAROLINE
                  But what should I do?

                                BEN
                  Well, Caroline, I think the first
                  thing you have to do...
                         (voice rising)
                  ... is stop whining about this
                  pathetic loser! You're a tragedy
                  queen!
                         (mocking)
                  'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve
                  doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives
                  a shit! Get a fucking life! You
                  are, without a doubt, the most
                  boring human being I have ever met!
                  Please, say something interesting
                  before I lapse into a goddamn coma!

     Caroline looks curiously at Ben, unperturbed.

                  Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting
                  on your whole -- situation. It's
                  very interesting what you were
                  just saying. I want you to think
                  about it, and I'm going to think
                  about it, so we'll both think
                  about it and we'll continue next
                  week when I get back from my
                  vacation.

                  I can't help it. I hear you

                  Your mother and I, when we
                  got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't
                  put you in the middle, or use you
                  as a go-between to talk about each
                  other. So just do me a favor and
                  tell your mother to shut her big

      They enter a room where other Vitti family soldiers,
      EDDIE COKES, TUNA, and JOHNNY BIGS are waiting. In the
      middle of the room, a young rat named NICKY SHIVERS is
      tied to a chair under a strong overhead light. When he
      speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence.

      Nicky goes suddenly quiet. He watches in terror as Jimmy
      steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length
      of lead pipe.

      Vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe. They all
      wince in anticipation of the blow. But Vitti just
      freezes there with his arm upraised. Then he drops his
      arm and seems to sag.

                                 VITTI
                   Forget about it. He doesn't know

     The minivan has rear-ended a black Lincoln Town Car. The
     trunk has sprung open and Nicky Shivers can be seen in
     the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming.
     Muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over
     his mouth.

     Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top
     of the trunk just as Ben gets out of the minivan to
     inspect the damage.

     Ben looks at the damage. The Lincoln has gotten the
     worst of it. The rear bumper is hanging off, and Jelly
     is struggling to latch the trunk.

                                JIMMY

                  We understand it's a special day
                  for you, Benny, but your father
                  and I can't just pick up and

                  We want to be there, but I have
                  three book signings next weekend.
                  I can't piss off these big book
                  stores. If I cancel, they'll
                  stick me down on the bottom shelf.
                  That's how they are.

                                BEN
                  Yeah, that's the word on the
                  street. The self-help book
                  business is full of vindictive

                  I'm sorry, but I've been alone

                  met someone I want to spend the
                  rest of my life with and I would
                  really like you to meet her
                  before we get married. You're
                  going to be her family. I think
                  it's better she knows that up
                  front.

               Well, based on everything, I'd say
               you probably had an anxiety

               An anxiety attack. A panic

                  who panics?

                                DOCTOR
                         (nervous now)
                  There's nothing -- I mean -- it's
                  a common thing --

                                 VITTI
                  Where did you go to medical
                  school? I had a heart attack, you
                  quack bastard.

                                DOCTOR
                         (very scared now)
                  Well, not according to these --

     As Vitti moves toward the Doctor, Jelly instinctively
     grabs the Doctor from behind and holds him while Vitti
     wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck.

                                VITTI
                         (low and deadly,
                          pumping up the
                          cuff with the
                          squeeze-ball)
                  Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a
                  mild heart attack and now it's
                  over. You understand?

     The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the
     pressure around his neck increases.

                                VITTI
                  If anyone asks you, you never saw
                  me, and I was never here. Is that
                  clear?

                                 DOCTOR
                          (strangled)
                  Yes.

                                 VITTI
                  Good.
                         (to Jelly)
                  Take the chart.

     Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and
     follows Vitti out the door.

21   EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                                 21

     Vitti and Jelly come walking out the emergency room exit.
     Vitti stops.

                             VITTI
               Jelly, I need you to do something
               for me as my friend.

                                JELLY
               Anything.

                             VITTI
               You have to find me a doctor.

                             JELLY
               We just came from the doctor.

                             VITTI
               Not that kind of doctor.   I need a
               head doctor.

                             JELLY
               You're gonna change your face like
               Sonny Black? Don't get his nose
               though, he looks like a pig.

                             VITTI
               Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud.
               Do I have to spell everything out?

                                JELLY
               It saves time.

                             VITTI
               I need you to find me a
               psychiatrist.

                             JELLY
               Wow. This is like the Psychic
               Network or something. I just ran
               into a psychiatrist. Actually he
               ran into me.

                             VITTI
               Is he any good?

                             JELLY
               Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy.
               He had a business card and
               everything --

                             VITTI
               He had a card? That's a real
               fuckin' achievement.

                  What do you need a shrink for
                  anyway?

                                VITTI
                  It's not for me. It's for a
                  friend. This friend is having
                  some problems, so I'm going to ask
                  the shrink some questions and get
                  some answers for my friend.

                                  JELLY
                  Got it.

                                VITTI
                  And nobody can know. If anyone
                  hears I'm talking to a shrink, it
                  could be interpreted the wrong
                  way. You know what I mean?

                                JELLY
                  Of course. Absolutely.
                         (then)
                  Can I ask you one thing?

                                  VITTI
                  What?

                                  JELLY
                  This friend.    Is it me?

22   INT. BEN'S OFFICE - DAY                                           22

     Ben is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung
     milquetoast in his late forties.

                                BEN
                  Carl, I'm detecting a pattern
                  here. You seem to settle too
                  easily for things.

                                  CARL
                  You're right.    I do.

                                BEN
                  No, well, there you go. You
                  just did it again. I suggested
                  something and you immediately
                  agreed.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                  CARL
                  You're right.    I did.

                                BEN
                  Why do you think you do that?

                                  CARL
                  I don't know.

                                 BEN
                  Well, sometimes people do it
                  because they fear rejection or
                  disapproval, but you can't let
                  that worry you, Carl. And you
                  can't agree with things just for
                  the sake of agreeing. Stand
                  your ground. Don't let people
                  roll over you.

     The door opens and Jelly enters.

                                  JELLY
                  Dr. Sobol?

                                  BEN
                  Excuse me!    I'm in a session here.

                                JELLY
                  Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

                                BEN
                  You're... You're one of the guys
                  I rear-ended the other night.

                                  JELLY
                  Bingo.
                         (to Carl)
                  Get outta here.

     Jelly takes Carl by the elbow and lifts him off the
     couch.

                                 JELLY
                  Upsa-daisy.   You got a coat,
                  nutbar?

                                BEN
                  What are you doing?

                                  JELLY
                  He's leaving.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                BEN
                  The hell he is. He's not going
                  anywhere until we're done with his
                  session.

     Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket,
     removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of
     fifties.

                                JELLY
                         (to Carl)
                  I'll give you a hundred bucks to
                  get out of here.

     Carl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive
     look.

                                BEN
                  Don't take it, Carl.

     Carl looks back to Jelly.

                                JELLY
                         (peeling off another
                          bill)
                  A hundred and fifty.

                                BEN
                  He's not leaving.


                                 CARL
                         (trembling)
                  Three hundred.

                                JELLY
                         (pays him)
                  You're not that fuckin' crazy.

     Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and
     exits. Jelly follows him to the door and waves for
     someone to come in.

                                BEN
                  Listen, if you're upset about your
                  car, I can understand that. But
                  you don't just barge in here --

     Paul Vitti steps into the office.    Ben freezes.   Jelly
     crosses to take Vitti's coat.

                                VITTI
                  You know who I am?

                  Okay.

                                VITTI
                  You've seen my picture in the papers?

                                    BEN
                  Yes.    And no.    Sometimes.   Never.

                                VITTI
                  Jelly, wait outside.

     Jelly exits. Vitti walks around the room, taking
     everything in. He picks up the phone and listens.          Hangs
     up.

                                    VITTI
                  Sit down.

                                    BEN
                  Sure.

     Ben sits quickly on the coffee table. He crushes a box
     of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass.
     Vitti picks up a stack of CDS and looks through them.

                                VITTI
                  Tony Bennett, huh?

                                 BEN
                  Yeah.   He's my favorite.

     Vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from Ben's
     desk.

                                BEN
                         (puts up his hands)
                  Mr. Vitti, I tried to give the guy
                  my insurance information, but he
                  wouldn't take it. Seriously, I
                  tried several times because it was
                  all my please don't kill me.

                                VITTI
                  I was just gonna ask if you liked
                  baseball.

     Vitti puts the bat down.

                                BEN
                  Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your
                  fault, but your friend, he
                  interrupted a patient's session
                  and that's -- not good. I think
                  this is a matter for our insurance
                  companies, don't you think?

                                VITTI
                  I don't care about the car.

                                   BEN

                  A friend of mine is having a
                  problem and he might have to see a
                  shrink, so I'm going to ask you a
                  couple questions. Do we sit?

                                BEN
                  Whatever makes you comfortable.

     Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first.
     Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his

                  Okay, the first thing I gotta know
                  about is privacy. You must hear
                  a lot of weird shit in here. How
                  do I know you won't go testifying
                  -- not testifying -- but, you know,
                  talking about it to somebody else.

                                BEN
                  I won't discuss a patient with
                  anyone for any reason, unless I
                  know the patient may be a danger
                  to himself. Like if I'm concerned
                  a patient might kill himself...

     Ben looks to Vitti for a response.    Vitti stares at him
     for a long, uncomfortable beat.

                  out my friend. You didn't hear me
                  say that?

                  thrilled with the level of service

                  you know? Now all of a sudden,
                  he's falling apart. He cries
                  for no reason. He's having
                  trouble sleeping. And then he
                  started having these attacks. You
                  know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest
                  pains -- like you think you're
                  gonna die.

                  Right. So the question is, what
                  can he do to make it stop?

     Ben decides to go for it.

                   So judging from the mob scene
                   around the pool here today, I
                   think you'd have to say that
                   there's nothing 'off' about the
                   'off-season' in Miami Beach this
                   summer. Now, on a personal note,
                   this is my last report for
                   W.V.B.F. I'm getting married

                   No, it was nice, but I'm fourteen

                  I got news for you. I'm still

                  Mr. Vitti. And I'll tell you
                  something else. I don't appreciate
                  it when someone breaks into my
                  hotel room and kidnaps me. I don't
                  go for that. I have a family and

                  injured animal. It's only a
                  matter of time before one of the
                  lions out there catches the scent.
                  Then I'm dead. That's the way it
                  is. If you don't understand that,
                  then you don't understand the life
                  I live and you don't understand
                  me.

                  I have until the end of the week
                  to get strong or they're gonna eat
                  me up. If they don't kill me in

                  playing with a couple of puppies.
                  I cried for 45 minutes. Slap a

                   up, you were gone, no note or
                   anything. I've been going out of
                   my mind, Ben. I walked all over

                   Listen, it's been taken care of.
                   I told him I couldn't see him

               Are you measuring my inseam or
               contemplating a lifestyle change?

               Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we
               were growing up, he was the smart
               guy; I was the dope. My father
               was a nickel-and-dime shitheel;
               his father had it all. Vito
               Genovese blew it at Apalachin
               because he forgot to kill Gambino
               before the meeting.

                   I don't understand. They jump
                   out of the water, they splash,
                   they eat fish. It's not a real
                   stretch for a whale. If they
                   did a number from West Side
                   Story, then I'd be into it.

                  Well, you see, they'd come out and
                  say hello, but the whole family's
                  in the Witness Protection Program.
                  It's very sad. What the fuck you
                  want from me?

     They start walking.

      Laura's family, the MacNamaras, and a few close friends
      have gathered for the rehearsal dinner. There are three
      tables in a roped-off section of the restaurant with large
      floral centerpieces, a small bar in the corner. The
      MacNamaras, SCOTT and BELINDA, are standing with Laura,
      Ben, Michael and a couple of other relatives.

                              BELINDA
                Well, isn't this wonderful, all
                of us finally getting to spend
                some time together.

                   Well, if tomorrow goes as
                   well as the rehearsal, I'd say
                   it's going to be a beautiful
                   wedding.

                                 BEN
                   Yes, thanks for going to all this
                   trouble, and I have to thank you
                   and the Captain for something
                   else.

                                 SCOTT

                   For this.

      Everyone "ahhs" as Ben gives Laura a peck on the cheek.
      Michael makes a face.

                                 LAURA
                          (to Ben)
                   Would you like a drink, because
                   I'm definitely having eight or
                   nine.

                          (disapproving)
                   Shall we go to the table?

      As the woman go to their seats, Scott holds Ben back for a
      private moment.


                          SCOTT
                   Ben, there's a lot I'd like to
                   say to you, but I'm going to
                   skip the big father-in-law
                   speech because I know you've
                   been married before.

                   Technically, it wasn't considered a
                   marriage. It was like the Korean
                   War -- more of a police action.

                                 SCOTT
                   I served in Korea, son. I don't
                   think you'd be laughing if you'd
                   seen some of the things I saw.

      the room, followed by their kids and a knot of bodyguards.
      Ben's face falls. He rushes over to intercept them.

                                 VITTI
                   This is what I'm paying you for? I
                   say something, you say it right
                   back to me? I could get Jelly to
                   do this for nothing.

                                 BEN
                   Then get Jelly.

      Ben starts to walk off the patio and comes face to face
      with Laura's father, Scott.

                                    BEN
                   Mr. MacNamara.

      Ben exits. Scott MacNamara stares suspiciously at Vitti,
      wondering about his connection to Ben.

      Jelly walks up to one of the bodyguards.

                                 JELLY
                   I'm gonna get something to eat.
                   You want like a sandwich or
                   somethin'?

                                  BODYGUARD
                   Yeah. What kinda sandwich isn't
                   too fattening?

                                 JELLY
                   A half a sandwich.

                                  BODYGUARD
                   Sounds good.

                                 JELLY
                   I'll be back in about twenty
                   minutes.

      The elevator arrives, Jelly gets in and the doors close
      behind him.

      The doors open and the Bodyguard turns to look. TWO
      SHOTS from a PISTOL with a SILENCER strike him in the
      chest and he falls to the floor dead. Tino steps out and
      drags the body to the stairwell.

      The guests are seated, Ben and Michael stand with the
      justice of the peace as Scott walks Laura down the aisle.
      The harpist is playing and all's right with the world.
      Scott shakes Ben's hand.

                              SCOTT
                       (quietly, to Ben)
                Nod your head and smile. Now, you
                listen to me, goombah. I know what
                your game is, and you'd better
                call it quits, because if you and
                your paisans do anything to hurt
                my little girl, I'll kill you.
                Understand? Nod and smile.

      Scott crosses away.

      Using a stolen pass key, Tino quietly opens the door and
      enters. He steps into the living room and hears WATER
      RUNNING in the bathroom. He stealthily approaches the
      bathroom door and draws his pistol with a silencer on it
      from under his jacket.

                                                               70.

      Vitti stares at his reflection in the mirror, then starts
      washing his face. In the mirror we can see the door
      starting to open behind him, and the long barrel of
      Tino's pistol through the crack. Vitti blindly gropes
      for a towel and starts drying his face.


47    INT. VITTI'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                               47

      Tino is about to shoot when Jelly comes up behind him,
      throws one strong arm around his neck in a powerful
      choke-hold, and grabs Tino's gun-hand with his free hand.

      Vitti hears the sounds of a scuffle, steps out of the
      bathroom, and sees Jelly struggling with Tino.

      Tino gets off a couple of wild SHOTS, but Jelly finally
      shakes the GUN loose from Tino's hand.

      Vitti picks up the gun and puts it to Tino's head. Tino
      shuts his eyes and turns away, expecting the shot, but
      then Vitti's hand starts to shake and he breaks into a
      cold sweat.

      Tino opens his eyes, sees Vitti frozen, and starts
      fighting with renewed strength. Jelly hangs on, looks at
      Vitti with concern, then wrestles Tino out onto the
      balcony.

      A beat, then a SCREAM is heard from above, then Tino
      crashes into a buffet table in the b.g. Wedding guests
      react in horror.

     Jimmy and Jelly are hastily throwing clothes into
     suitcases. Vitti comes out of the bedroom hurriedly
     buttoning up his shirt.

                             VITTI
                      (urgently, to Jelly)

               You get the car, bring it around
               to the back and wait for me.

     Ben bursts into the room.

                              BEN
               That's it.   I've had it with you!

                                VITTI

               What happened? I just saw a man
               fall seven stories into a platter
               of poached salmon! That's what
               happened.

                             VITTI
               Did he break anything?

               Yes. Everything! They're still

               forehead.

                             VITTI
               Hey, people get depressed, they
               jump. It's a human tragedy,
               but it's not my fault.

                  about? Being an accessory to
                  murder was not part of our

                  Hey, why you busting my balls? I

                  This whole thing has been one
                  big disaster from the minute
                  you walked into my office.
                  We're finished! You hear me?
                  I am no longer your doctor!

                                VITTI
                  Just 'cause of this?

                  Of course because of this! You
                  don't have even the tiniest shred
                  of human decency. All you know
                  is threats and violence and
                  that's all you'll ever know and
                  I can't be around that!

     Vitti stares at Ben for a long beat.

     Sindone is watching "America's Most Wanted," rooting for
     the criminals. Moony comes to him looking concerned.

                  How come I can't get on this show?

     INTERCUT Vitti and Sindone.

     Vitti is on the phone, struggling to contain his rage.
     Ben watches.

                  Primo, it's Paul Vitti.

                                VITTI
                  Not good. Whoever killed Dominic
                  is shooting at me now and I'm
                  having a lot of feelings about it
                  and I'd like to get some kinda --

                  -- closure on this.

     Ben nods in encouragement.

                                SINDONE
                  What kind of feelings?

                                VITTI
                  I feel very angry, you know. Very,
                  uh, enraged. Mad. Real mad.

     Thumbs up from Ben.

                                SINDONE
                  So why you telling me?

                  I don't know what you're talking

     Ben, Laura and Michael are staring up at the elaborate

                  Call the Vatican. Ask them if

                  It's almost as tall as the house!

     Michael crosses away.    Laura glares at Ben.

                  He felt bad. It's a wedding gift.

                  Well, we're not married, so I
                  guess we'll have to send it back.

                                BEN
                  Hey, don't blame me. You didn't
                  want to finish the ceremony.

                                LAURA
                  What did you expect? You think
                  that's what I want to remember on
                  our anniversary? 'Gee, honey,
                  let's go look at the wedding
                  video. There's my parents,
                  there's your parents, and there's

                  I'm starting to think that's not
                  going to happen.

                  Come on. Next Saturday. It's all
                  set. I even asked for a room with
                  a low ceiling, just to discourage
                  the jumpers.

     of Ben and Paul Vitti taken in Miami and just about
     everywhere else.

                  I'm a psychotherapist.    Paul

                  Right.

                                PROVANO
                  So why did he send you that
                  fountain?

                                BEN
                  That was a gift to celebrate the
                  completion of his therapy. We
                  got our television from an
                  agoraphobic, so it's not that
                  unusual -- you know, maybe you
                  should discuss this with my
                  attorney.

                                LAURA

                                AGENT STEADMAN
                  Doctor Sobol, Paul Vitti is an
                  extremely dangerous man. We're
                  talking conspiracy, fraud,
                  extortion, racketeering,
                  grand theft, murder...

                                BEN
                  Well, yeah, but don't forget, the
                  man is a sociopath. You've got
                  to expect that kind of behavior --

     Ben looks out the window and does a double take.

                  Excuse me, fellas. My folks are
                  here and I'd like to -- well, die
                  would be my first choice. Can I

               Hi!   What a surprise.

     Ben kisses his mother as she stares at the fountain.

                             DOROTHY
               That certainly makes a statement.
               It's a little big for the yard,
               don't you think?

               What can I tell you, Mom? It
               looked much smaller in the store.

               Think it'll affect your water

               Your father and I are just very
               concerned about what happened
               in Florida.

               We got in last night, we couldn't
               sleep a wink. Is Laura inside?

                             BEN
               Yeah, but she and Michael are
               spending some time alone, you
               know, getting to know each other.
               That's important. I don't want
               to disturb that dynamic.

                                ISAAC
                  He's your patient? Are you
                  joking? Have you thought about
                  what this could do to your
                  reputation?

                                BEN
                  You, know, I always wanted to be
                  great, but then I realized that I
                  might have to settle for just being
                  good enough. Now I've got this guy
                  who's hurting and I'm thinking that
                  if I can help this guy, maybe I can
                  be a little bit great.

                                ISAAC
                  Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's
                  going to be hurting. I want you
                  to stop seeing him.

                                BEN
                  Didn't you read your own book?
                  Instead of trying to run my
                  life, why don't you just close
                  your eyes, take a deep breath, tell
                  me what you feel, tell me what
                  you want.

                  You know why I became a shrink?
                  Because I grew up with a great
                  one walking around the house.

                                ISAAC
                  I thought you became a shrink
                  because you were sleeping with
                  your psychology professor at
                  Columbia.

                  Let me cut to the chase. Sometime

                  of every major crime family in the
                  United States are going to meet
                  together somewhere in the New York

                  We think the stage is set for a

                  bloodbath, I probably would've
                  remembered it. Bloodbath is one
                  of those words that, you know,

                  Paul, I don't mean this in a

                  what I say in there.

                                MASIELLO
                  Paul, I beg to differ. If you're
                  doing this to establish some kind
                  of insanity defense later, that's
                  one thing. But everybody's gonna
                  think you're falling apart, and
                  that ain't good. They'll take it
                  as a sign of weakness, and that
                  makes us all vulnerable. Sindone
                  would take over everything.

                                VITTI
                  So what do you want me to do?

                                MASIELLO
                  It's time to end it.

                                VITTI
                  What do you mean, end it?

                                MASIELLO
                  Get rid of this shrink.   He knows
                  too much already.

                                VITTI
                  You want me to whack my doctor?

                                MASIELLO
                  If you don't do it, somebody else
                  will. It's the only way.

                                VITTI
                  No. Nobody touches him. You hear
                  me? Anybody lays a finger on him,
                  I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?

                                                       CUT TO:

64A   FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET ON LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY              64A

      Vitti and Ben are walking down the street.   For some
      reason, Vitti is wearing a hat.

                              BEN
                I'm going to buy some fruit.
                You want anything?

                                VITTI
                No, go ahead.

      Ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking
      out oranges. Vitti leans up against a car waiting for
      him to finish. SHOTS are FIRED. He runs toward the car.
      More SHOTS are FIRED. Ben is hit. Vitti pulls out his
      gun but he fumbles and drops it. The gunmen run off.
      Ben sinks to the pavement, mortally wounded. Vitti kneels
      next to him and sobs loudly. He puts his hand to his
      head, knocking off his hat.

                                VITTI
                Papa!   Papa!


64B   INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    64B

      Ben jerks upright in bed, knocked awake by the nightmare.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


65    HOLY WATER FONT                                               65

      Someone dips their fingers in.


      INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NEXT DAY

      It's Vitti. He goes down on one knee and genuflects in
      front of a big crucifix. Ben wiggles his finger in the
      holy water, just kind of curtsies and waves at Jesus on
      the cross.

                              VITTI
                You look lousy. You all right.

                              BEN
                Listen, Paul, please don't send me
                any more gifts.

                              VITTI
                You didn't like the fountain?

                                BEN
                  That's not the point.   It's a
                  boundary issue.

                                 VITTI
                  Boundary issue? I say if more
                  people gave from the heart, we'd
                  all be better off. Let's see your
                  watch.
                         (as Ben shows his
                          wrist)
                  Piece of junk. You're getting a
                  Rolex.

                                BEN
                  Don't buy me a Rolex.

                                VITTI
                  Who said anything about buying it?

     They cross to the main aisle of the church.

                                BEN
                  Listen, I really need to talk
                  to you.

     Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar.
     A funeral service is in progress.

                                VITTI
                  Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
                  Worked for a crew out of Jersey
                  City.

                                BEN
                  How did he die?

                                VITTI
                  He was on his way to talk to a
                  federal prosecutor. Got hit by
                  a truck -- twice.

                                BEN
                  Do I need to know that? I'm
                  having nightmares as it is.

     The funeral procession comes down the aisle.

                                BEN
                  Last night I dreamed we were
                  walking down the street, I stopped
                  to buy some fruit, and they shot
                  me -- like Brando in The Godfather.

                   Good scene.    Was I there?

      A mourner walks up to Vitti, bows his head in respect and
      kisses Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti
      gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder, then the man
      kisses Ben and walks off.

                                 BEN
                   You dropped your gun, then you ran
                   over to me and started yelling,
                   'Papa, Papa!'

                                   VITTI
                   I was Fredo.    I don't think so.

      An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks.
      Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's
      hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as
      they walk by.

                                 VITTI
                   You're losing it, Doc.   You may
                   need therapy yourself.

      A man comes up to Vitti, kisses him on both cheeks,
      embraces him with excessive energy, then repeats the
      whole scene with Ben and exits. Ben looks at Vitti.

                                 VITTI
                   Him I don't know. Let's get

                  milk dream was about, too.

                  my mother on the phone after that
                  thing you told me.

                  Let's say you are the baby. What
                  kind of milk did you get from

                  I've never been to Italy but I'd
                  love to go. I've been to France.

     Ben goes into a stall, latches the door and drops his

     Ben hastily unbuttons his shirt, revealing a small
     microphone taped to his chest. He picks at the edge of
     the tape, takes a deep breath, then rips it off.

                  You need more roughage. A bran
                  muffin in the morning would
                  help with that.

                  There's a big difference.   Why

                  whole family was having dinner
                  together right over there, two
                  guys walked in and shot him dead

                  You know what? I think you want
                  to talk about it.

                                VITTI
                  No, I don't want to talk about it.

                  So good luck.    It's been --

     Vitti nods, they stand there for another moment, then Ben
     walks off into the night.

     ELAINE, a fortyish, tired-looking wife and mother sits
     on the couch across from Ben. Ben looks bored and
     depressed.

                                ELAINE
                  I want to please him in bed, but
                  whatever I do it seems like it's
                  never enough. Now he wants me to
                  say things when we're making love.

                  What kinds of things does he want
                  you to say, Elaine?

                                ELAINE
                  Well, he wants me to call him 'big
                  boy.' And he's my bucking bronco,
                  and I'm supposed to ride him hard
                  and put him back in the barn wet.

     Michael's laughter is heard coming through the vent.        Ben
     closes his eyes and sighs deeply.

                                ELAINE
                  Are you all right, Dr. Sobol?

                                BEN
                  Let me suggest something, Elaine.
                  If the man wants you to say things
                  ... damn it, you should get down
                  on all fours and bark like a dog
                  if that's going to get the job
                  done. Break out the wine, baby.
                  Smoke a joint. Do what you have
                  to do, because life is too short.
                  It's just too fucking short.

     Elaine stares, taken aback, then she smiles.

                                ELAINE
                  Okay.

     on his tie, looking very strong.

                   No, I'm great. Never felt better
                   in my life. When this meeting is
                   over they won't know what hit 'em.

      Jelly gives him the thumbs up and exits. Vitti turns to
      the TV and starts knotting his tie as a PRUDENTIAL
      INSURANCE COMMERCIAL STARTS PLAYING, featuring a father
      and his son. As Vitti watches the sentimental ad, his
      eyes fill with tears.

      The crowd oohs and aahs as Laura starts down the aisle
      in her wedding dress. Isaac and Dorothy are standing
      near the chupah ready to receive her.

                                 DOROTHY
                   Is Ben going to step on the glass?

                                 ISAAC
                   No. He doesn't want to hurt his
                   foot, so they're going to drop a
                   person on it.

      is gathered again. Michael stands just to the side.

                                 RABBI
                   We are put on this earth to find a
                   love, a soulmate, someone with whom
                   we can create joy. How glad we are

                   each other, and we anticipate and
                   celebrate the years of joy they will

                   Ben, do you take this woman, Laura,
                   to be your lawfully wedded wife, for
                   richer, for poorer, in sickness and
                   in health, 'til death do you part,
                   so help you God?

      Another PSST. Ben looks over and sees Jelly standing
      behind some flowers to the side of the altar.

                   Yes to the thing before. To her.
                   That's a yes. Pick it up from
                   there.

                    Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't
                    shoot you. But here's something
                    about me you should know. I never
                    got married, Doctor Sobol. I
                    don't have a hobby. I never got a
                    dog or a cat. I don't even have a
                    goldfish. I live for one reason
                    only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul
                    Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about
                    when I wake up, and he's what I'm
                    thinking about when I close my eyes
                    to sleep. If he told me to jump off
                    a tall building, not only would I do
                    it, I would hope to survive so I could
                    do it again and again until he told me
                    to stop. This is all I know. This is
                    all I got. So please don't think I
                    won't kill you, because I'd hate for
                    your last thought to be a wrong one.
                    You're going to that meeting.

105A   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                           105A

       Ben is in the back with Jelly and Jimmy. One of their
       crew, IRON MIKE, is driving. Ben is putting on a suit
       of Jimmy's. He looks very anxious.

                               JIMMY
                        (his shoulder bandaged)
                 Just remember. That's a fuckin'
                 $1200 Valentino suit. You spill
                 anything on it, I'll mess you up
                 good.

                               JELLY
                 Shut up. You're making him
                 nervous. If he gets nervous and
                 fucks up, they'll kill him for
                 sure.
                        (to Ben)
                 Let's go over it again.

                               BEN
                 This is insane.

                               JELLY
                 Mr. Vitti's been detained,
                 apologies all around, blah, blah,
                 blah. Then you say you're the new
                 consigliere, and you're prepared
                 to speak for Mr. Vitti.

                               BEN
                 Then what?

                               JELLY
                 Then you just keep your mouth
                 shut, and hope nobody asks you
                 nothin'.

                               JIMMY
                 Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.

                               JELLY
                 Shut up.
                        (to Ben)
                 If you have to talk, just be
                 vague. Can you do that?

                               BEN
                 I'm a psychologist.   Believe me, I
                 can be vague.

106   INT. VITTI'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                               106

      Vitti is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling. Marie
      is stroking his forehead. Then he looks over and sees
      Anthony sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed,
      watching him with concern.

                              VITTI
                Shouldn't you be outside playing
                or something?

                              ANTHONY
                No, it's all right.

                              VITTI
                How long you gonna sit there?

                              ANTHONY
                       (shrugs)
                How long you gonna lay there?

      Vitti smiles.

                              VITTI
                I'm done.

      Service. Fifty other limos are already parked there.
      Jelly and Jimmy get out, followed by Ben, now dressed in
      shiny suit and pinky ring.

108   INT. TOPS LIMO GARAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      108

      Ben, Jelly, and Jimmy enter a garage the size of a small
      airplane hangar. The floor has been cleared and long
      tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room.
      Wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor
      and soldiers are posted at all the doors.

                              BEN
                       (sotto voce)
                I can't do this. I'm telling you,
                I cannot do this.

                              JELLY
                Don't fucking whine! Whining's a
                dead giveaway. Come on! You're
                the consigliere, for Chrissake.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest
      gangsters in the world. A few captains stand around the
      perimeter, ready to serve their bosses.

                                 BEN
                   These are the bosses? That one
                   looks like my Uncle Max.

      Jelly steers Ben to an empty seat next to Carlo Mangano.

                                 MANGANO
                          (surprised)
                   What's goin' on? Where's Vitti?

                                  JELLY
                   On his way.   Don't worry.

      Mangano eyes Ben with contempt.

                                 MANGANO
                   What's he doin' here?

                                 JELLY
                   He's -- it's okay. Forget about
                   it.

                                 MANGANO
                   Forget about it? What the hell is
                   that?

      Seated directly across the room from Ben is Primo
      Sindone. He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him,
      then leans over to Moony, his consigliere.

                                 SINDONE
                   Who's the guy with Jelly?

                                   MOONY
                   I don't know.

      Ben looks away nervously.

                                 BEN
                          (to Jelly, borderline
                           hysterical)
                   I can't do this.

      He starts to get up but Jelly pulls him back down.

      Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.

                   All right, gentlemen. I think we
                   better start. We have a big
                   agenda, so for now let's stick to
                   the big issues. And it would help
                   if you identify yourselves when
                   you speak, since we don't all know
                   each other, and we didn't think
                   anybody would be into wearing any
                   fucking name tags.

      Laughter around the table.

      Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben.

                                 SINDONE
                   I'm Primo Sindone. They call me
                   Sonny Long. It's good to see so
                   many of the old faces here, and to
                   welcome the new ones from all over
                   the country. I see Frank Zello,
                   and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a
                   little disappointed to see that
                   the head of our other New York
                   family isn't here today. All I
                   see is his man Jelly and some
                   sawed-off little prick nobody
                   knows.

      Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben
      just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands.

                                 JELLY
                          (stands up, rattled)
                   Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti
                   has been detained and he sends his
                   apologies for -- being detained --
                   and he apologizes for his --
                   detainment.

                                 SINDONE
                   Detained? What kind of bullshit
                   is that? What's more important
                   than this? As the host of this
                   meeting, I take his not being here
                   as a sign of disrespect to me and
                   to all these other men, too, who
                   came a long way to be here.

                                 JELLY
                   Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect.
                   The thing is, he's not feeling
                   well. He's sick and he -- didn't
                   feel well --

                   You know better.

      Jelly is stunned.    The bosses murmur.

                   All right, who is this guy and

                   to speak for Mr. Vitti on all

                                 SINDONE
                   Okay, Doctor, then let's get down
                   to business. Everybody knows
                   there's been this thing between me
                   and Paul Vitti for a long time.

                                 BEN
                   Which thing are you talking about?
                   The first thing or the second

                   Well, I don't see how we can
                   discuss the first thing without
                   bringing up the second thing.
                   Didn't you talk to the guy?

      He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe.

                                   SINDONE
                   What guy?

                                 BEN
                   The guy with the thing.

                                  SINDONE
                   What thing? What the fuck are you
                   talking about?

                                 BEN

                          (gestures helplessly
                           to the others)
                   This is the whole problem. You
                   can't have an intelligent
                   conversation with the man.

                   How about if I just break your

      Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, FRANK ZELLO
      and JOE BALDASSARE.

                                 SINDONE
                   What's he talking about?

                   tendency to get angry a lot.

                                 BALDASSARE
                   I agree, Primo.

      Sindone whips out a pistol and points it at Ben, but just
      as he's about to shoot --

                                  VITTI (O.S.)
                   Primo!

      All eyes turn.


109   PAUL VITTI                                                       109

      He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and
      unafraid. He looks like a king. The room goes silent.
      Vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to Ben.
      Jelly gets up to greet him.

                                 VITTI
                          (quietly, to Jelly)
                   Wait outside with the car running.

      Jelly nods and exits.

                                 BEN
                   What are you doing here?

                                 VITTI
                   Saving your ass. Sit down.    I'll
                   take it from here.

      Ben sits, greatly relieved.

                                 VITTI
                          (to the group)
                   I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was
                   late. Those of you who know me
                   will know I meant no disrespect.
                   If it's all right with you,
                   there's something I'd like to say,
                   then I'll leave you to your
                   business.

      Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and
      clarity he's never seen before.

                                 VITTI
                   About two and a half weeks ago,
                   somebody killed my friend, Dominic
                   Manetta.

      He looks straight at Sindone.

                                 SINDONE
                   Don't look at me. Everybody knows
                   you whacked him so you could take
                   over everything.

                                 VITTI
                   What I really came here to say is
                   that I've come to a very important
                   decision in my life. I want out.

      A great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room.      Ben
      looks at him proudly.

                                 VITTI
                   I'm going away for a while, but I
                   will respect the oath I took the
                   day I was made, and whatever I
                   know about anyone else's business,
                   I take with me to the grave. You
                   have my word.

      A negative buzz among the bosses.

                                 VITTI
                   As for my own organization, I know
                   Carlo Mangano would like to be the
                   new boss.

      Mangano smiles gratefully.

                                 MANGANO
                   Thank you, Paul.

                                 VITTI
                   That's why he betrayed Dominic and
                   me to our enemies and sent his own
                   man to kill me in Miami.

      Mangano is stunned.

                                 VITTI
                   But I leave it to my people to
                   deal with that and choose their
                   own boss. And even though it's my
                   right, I won't take revenge,
                   mostly because I'm in a good place
                   mentally and feeling good about me.

                   I don't know, Paul. I can see
                   where some people might have a
                   problem with this.

                                 VITTI
                   I realize that, so as an extra
                   token of good faith between us,
                   I've taken the liberty of writing
                   down everything I know and putting
                   it in a safe deposit box in case
                   anything happens to me or my
                   family.

      There's a long tense silence while the other bosses
      consider all this. Then, finally --

                   I don't know what anybody else

                   God bless, Paul.

      They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti.     Ben raises
      his glass to Vitti and drinks.

      Ben and Vitti come out of the building and cross to the
      car. Jelly is waiting, Iron Mike has the MOTOR RUNNING,

                   I don't want to do this, Primo.

                                 SINDONE
                   You don't want to do this? That's

                   Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna
                   stab me in the back like the piece
                   of shit I always knew you were?

      Mangano stares at him, cold and hard.

                                 MANGANO
                   I'm not gonna stab you in the
                   back, Paul. I want to see your
                   face when I do it.

                                 VITTI
                   I don't think so.
                          (calls out)
                   Mo-Mo!

      Mo-Mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at
      Mangano and Sindone.

      Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an
      assault rifle.

                                 VITTI
                   Eddie!

      The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna
      manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod.

                                 VITTI
                   It's over, Primo. Now get the
                   fuck outta here.

      Sindone glares at him, then lowers his gun, turns, and
      starts to walk back into the building joined by Mangano
      and the soldiers.

                                  BEN
                    Good thinking. I was going to
                    bring a machine gun but I don't
                    have one. Of course, we haven't

                         I'll tell you what's not cool.

                         How Gary gets this superbad rap.

               MONTAGE of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, WIRED) 
               featuring Gary Boyd. They say, eg: "Who Owns Cyberspace?" On 
               a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: "ROBBER 
               BARON OR VISIONARY? Outpost's Antitrust Woes"

                                     TERRY (V.O.)
                         There's this prejudice against super-
                         smart people. People like Gary.

               GARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional 
               Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm:

                                     GARY
                         A kid working in his garage can create 
                         the next Outpost, the new IBM. All 
                         it takes is a great idea.

               A bloated Senator looks hostile.

                                     GARY
                         That's why nobody can have a monopoly 
                         in a business built on ideas.

               As we watch, CAMERA pulls back from the screen on which the 
               movie is being projected. REVERSE INTO:

               INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - EVENING (END MAIN TITLES)

               Over an audience of 40 or so computer students we read:

               STANFORD UNIVERSITY

               We pick out MILO CONNOR, watching keenly. He's 21: clear-
               eyed, alive, innocent. He sits with his best friend, TEDDY 
               CHIN, third-generation Chinese-American.

                                     DIFFERENT VOICE (V.O.)
                         The coolest? Gary. He's like you or 
                         me. If we happened t'be insanely 
                         rich.

               Some appreciative laughter in the auditorium. But behind 
               Milo, LARRY LINDHOLM squirms in his seat. He whispers:

                                     LARRY
                         Can we go?

                                     VOICE (FROM THE FILM)
                         For me? It's Seattle!

                                     LARRY
                         'Starting to get nauseated.

               BRIAN BISSEL, in front of Milo, twists in his seat:

                                     BRIAN
                         Do you mind?

               Larry gets up.

               Two Outpost Recruiters, REDMOND PRICE, 31 (gray suit) and 
               DANNY BAYLOR, 29 (Outpost '98 golf shirt) note the walkout. 
               Danny scans headshots in a Stanford Yearbook. (On-screen 
               behind them we see Seattle: night streets wet-down & 
               shimmering; Young People entering a club; Young People 
               climbing Mt. Shasta.) Finding Larry's picture, Danny points 
               out the name to Redmond, who shrugs: unconcerned.

                                     VOICE FROM THE MOVIE
                         Did anybody mention the beverages?

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               The double-doors swing open (over them, a plate reads: THE 
               HEWLITT-PACKARD AUDITORIUM) and Larry comes out.

               UP THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               ALICE POULSON, a very pretty girl of 21 (more hiply dressed 
               than the geeks) searches the hall, reading the names over 
               the doors (NEC Communications Classroom, Toshiba Computer 
               Lab, Mitsubishi Classroom). She spots Larry.

                                     ALICE
                         Is it over?

                                     LARRY
                         They still have to give 'em 
                         refreshments laced with mind-altering 
                         drugs.

                                     ALICE
                         You are a fanatic.

                                     LARRY
                         'Gonna wait outside.

               EXT. STANFORD COMPUTER SCIENCE BLDG. - A MOMENT LATER

               Tilting down the neo-classical edifice, we read the name 
               etched over the entrance: WILLIAM GATES COMPUTER SCIENCE 
               BUILDING. We find Larry and Alice sitting on the steps.

                                     LARRY (AT FIRST O.S.)
                         Alice? You gotta make him do the 
                         start-up with Teddy and me.

                                     ALICE
                         "Make" him?

                                     LARRY
                              (thoughtfully)
                         You know what I mean.

               As we hear Larry speak, we cut back into:

               THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               The lights are on. Milo & Teddy stand by a table dressed in 
               Outpost bunting, laden with refreshments & giveaways: 
               mousepads, T-shirts, caps & books with the Outpost logo on 
               them (a simple contour drawing of a frontier outpost). While 
               most Students chat earnestly with Recruiters, Milo & Teddy 
               load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips.

                                     LARRY (V.O.)
                         I'm not exactly worldly, but I'm the 
                         Secretary of State next to him.

               Milo puts some brownies on his plate.

                                     LARRY (V.O.)
                         And they're all throwing this -- 
                         stuff at him. Stock options. Pay 
                         packages.

               Spotting a book on the table, Milo picks it up.

               EXT. GATES BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

                                     LARRY
                         I'm just screwed.

                                     ALICE
                              (that's not true)
                         You know what he's like. He just 
                         wants to work on stuff that's cool.

                                     LARRY
                         You don't wanna move, do you?

                                     ALICE
                         I can paint anywhere.

               Larry looks at her: you didn't answer my question.

                                     ALICE
                         I'd like to stay here, yeah. And I 
                         kind of think he should be with Teddy.

               THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo and Teddy discuss the book almost joyfully. (We see a 
               page of code: utterly indecipherable.)

                                     ALICE (V.O.)
                         I mean, nobody else can follow what 
                         they're talking about half the time.

                                     ALICE
                         Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard. 
                         About Outpost. No offense, you sound 
                         insane.

                                     LARRY
                         I can't help it. I feel like they'd 
                         do anything to keep their --

                                     ALICE
                         Anything? That's not even credible. 
                         If he wants to go up there? To check 
                         it out? I think you should encourage 
                         him.
                              (seeing Larry's 
                              incredulity)
                         It's his life. But everybody's 
                         treating him like this -- valuable  
                         object. You're hurting your own case.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               Brian, already wearing one of the Outpost caps, effuses to 
               Redmond.

                                     BRIAN
                         He's my god. I hear he actually calls 
                         recruits sometimes. Or is that an 
                         Urban Legend?

                                     REDMOND
                         Gary's running the biggest software 
                         company in the world, Brian. He's 
                         being harassed by the Justice 
                         Department, and he's got a new baby.

               Across the room, Milo (eating chips, perusing code) reaches 
               for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting. It unravels 
               in a long TP-like streamer -- just as Danny approaches, 
               peering at Milo's ID tag.

                                     DANNY
                         Milo? I'm Danny.

                         Oh hi.

               He tries to sluff the paper off his hand; Danny holds out a 
               cell phone.

                                     DANNY
                         Gary would like to speak to you?

               Milo and Teddy look at each other: right. But Danny looks 
               like he means it. Milo's grin fades. He takes the phone.

                                     MILO
                         ...Hello?

                                     GARY (ON THE PHONE)
                         Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and 
                         your friend can come up here. We've 
                         made some amazing strides in digital 
                         convergence. I'd love to show them 
                         to you.

                                     MILO
                         You would? Wow. When would we come?
                              (he waits; he looks 
                              up)
                         'Think he hung up.

               Danny holds out two plane tickets, in 1st class folders.

               Alice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously.

                                     ALICE
                         But how does he know that's what you 
                         guys're working on?

               Larry, Teddy & Brian are at the table with Alice & Milo. 
               It's a student hang-out, with loud music.

                                     MILO
                         All the companies know. The faculties 
                         tell 'em. At the target schools.

                                     LARRY
                         In exchange for endowments. They 
                         should just drop the pretense and 
                         name the schools after 'em.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Teddy)
                         I can't believe you refused a ticket!

                                     TEDDY
                         My parents're already freaked-out 
                         I'm staying here. 50 miles from

                                     BRIAN
                         Well maybe if you told 'em how much 
                         money you'd be making --
                              (to Milo)
                         You're going up there. Right?

                                     LARRY
                         I think you should go.

                                     MILO
                              (amazed)
                         You do?

                                     LARRY
                         I mean, it's your life.

               As Alice predicted, Milo is pleased by Larry's remark. 
               "Empowered." Larry smiles conspiratorially at Alice.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               In a tidy, playfully decorated room, Alice stirs in bed, 
               sees the space next to her is vacant.

               TINY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of 
               a PC. He looks up, sees Alice in the doorway.

                                     MILO
                         I think I kind of lost it. I was 
                         just so thrilled to be talking to 
                         the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't 
                         know I even cared about that stuff.

                                     ALICE
                         C'mon, how often do you talk to 
                         somebody who's been on the cover of 
                         Time. Three of four times.

               She picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code 
               manuals, Coke cans) sits next to him.

                         A lot of what Larry says is true. 
                         They just clone stuff, or reverse 
                         engineer it, and everybody gets stuck 
                         with their inferior version cause 
                         they --

                                     ALICE
                         Then you've gotta ask him about that.

               He looks at her: you've gotta be kidding.

                                     ALICE
                         It's important.

                         If he's really a bully, he won't cop 
                         to it, anyway.

                                     ALICE
                         Bully? Are we talking about Gary 
                         Boyd? Or your dad.

               He doesn't deny it: she sees right through him.

                                     MILO
                         When I was a kid? And he was moving 
                         us all over the place? I spent all 
                         my time writing stuff on Outpost 
                         1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the 
                         greatest.

                                     ALICE
                         But he's not quite the same guy 
                         anymore. Don't get your hopes too 
                         high?

               INT. 737 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

               In the cabin, everybody types on a notebook but Milo. He 
               looks out the window expectantly: at the Seattle skyline.

               INT. SEA-TAC AIRPORT - GATE 13 - DAY

               Milo comes off the plane. Danny and Redmond greet him.

               INT/EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY

               Redmond drives his black Lexus 85 m.p.h. Danny leans forward 
               from the backseat.

                                     DANNY
                         'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?

                                     MILO
                         He's pretty tight with his family.

                                     DANNY
                         We could move 'em up here.

                                     MILO
                         He just likes to write code. He's 
                         bummed there's so much secrecy and 
                         competition, everybody trying to own 
                         everything.

                                     REDMOND
                         Who do you mean by "everybody."

               Milo almost blushes. He makes an awkward segue.

                                     MILO
                         So -- how far are we from the campus?

                                     REDMOND
                         Oh we're not going to the campus.

               EXT. GARY BOYD'S COMPOUND - LAKE WASHINGTON - DAY

               Beyond a rocky beach, buildings are cunningly carved into a 
               wooded hillside. Glass walls are framed in rich wood. The 
               main house is 28,000 sq. ft. Then there's the guest house, 
               pool building, reception hall, library...

               EXT. GATEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Redmond pulls up. A discreet Guard in a Mr. Rogers cardigan 
               recognizes him. The gates swing open.

               EXT. BOYD HOUSE - DAY

               They pull up by a Lexus SUV with a baby seat. Another Man in 
               a cardigan stands in the open front door.

                                     MILO
                         Who's that?

                                     DANNY
                         I think they call him the "Houseman." 
                         'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

               Milo just sits there, eyeing the monumental residence.

                                     DANNY
                         Don't be nervous. The house is the 
                         weirdest thing about him.

                                     REDMOND
                         It's like he knows everybody expects 
                         him to be this worldly, colorful 
                         zillionaire. But he's just a guy who 
                         likes software.

               INT. BOYD MANSION - DEN-LIKE ROOM - DAY

               Milo and the Houseman cross a long room with a lake view. We 
               hear music by Satie. The Craftsman furniture and lamps are 
               custom-made. A Cezanne hangs on the wall.

               ANOTHER DEN-LIKE ROOM WITH A VIEW

               There's a Craftsman crib here, stuffed animals, another 
               Cezanne. Even the toys seem arranged. They enter an

               ANTEROOM/CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Have a seat. He won't be long.

               Milo sits on a bench. He tries not to look, but his childhood 
               hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: 
               Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face. But 
               something goes on behind his pleasant features and self-
               possessed mien: his desire (or need) to solve the problem at 
               hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed -- even 
               vulnerable.

               CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               As Gary concentrates, two Outpost Senior Managers speak: 
               PHIL TATE, 40 (bald); and RANDY GRIMES, 36, (gray eyes).

                                     PHIL
                         We tried the big vaporware number, 
                         Gary, it's no-sale.

                                     RANDY
                         Can we buy into their IPO? Or is 
                         that a Justice Dept. problem?

                                     PHIL
                         There is no public offering. The guy 
                         who wrote it joined some freakazoid 
                         cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this 
                         just to run their web site.

               ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Gary speaks with precise hand gestures: settling the matter. 
               Phil and Randy gather their papers, and stand. They exit, 
               nodding at Milo as they pass. Then Gary comes out.

                                     GARY
                         Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV.

               Milo is a little dazzled as they shake hands: such a fam- 
               iliar face, such a big figure in his young life.

                                     MILO
                         ...That's okay.

               INT. DEN-LIKE ROOM - MOVING

               Now New Age music plays. They move back through the same 
               room, but the Cezanne has been replaced by a Hieronymus Bosch 
               (bodies roiling in Hell). Milo is -- puzzled.

                                     GARY
                         The house knows the paintings I like, 
                         it knows my favorite music. Same for 
                         anybody else who's in the system.

               NEXT ROOM - STILL MOVING

               As they walk, Milo watches a Cezanne "original" digitally re-
               configure to a Bosch, brushstrokes and all.

                                     MILO
                         Cool!

                                     GARY
                         Would you like a Coke or something?

                                     MILO
                              (too shy, too nervous)
                         Oh. No thanks.

               He opens a glass-doored refrigerator, scans a shelf with 
               rows of Snapples -- in alphabetical order.

                                     GARY
                         When we started, I just hired my 
                         smart friends. That was great. We 
                         got a little bigger, I had to hire 
                         smart strangers. Much harder.

               He selects a Kiwi-Raspberry, they walk on.

                                     GARY
                         Now I don't get to hire anybody. But 
                         I know you're the guy to write 
                         Skywire.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM (LAKE VIEW) - MOMENTS LATER

               They enter. An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptych. 
               As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stands 
               by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Soutine, 
               Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein...)

                                     MILO
                         You know a lot about art, I guess.

                                     GARY
                         There's a rumor going around, maybe 
                         you've heard it.

               Gary heads back, carrying something spherical.

                                     GARY
                         There's more to life than computers? 
                         I'm looking into it.

               Glancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks 
               vaguely afflicted. He mutters:

                                     GARY
                         'Once I start looking into something.

               Looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, 
               detailed metal object: model satellite.

                         I've only shown this to three other 
                         people. I bought 200, we've launched 
                         12 so far. I keep the coordinates in 
                         this room.
                              (as Milo takes it, 
                              carefully)
                         It's left over from SDI. Reagan's

                         linked together. Why cram it into a 
                         cable if you can use the whole sky?

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - LATER

               Milo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips his 
               own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language.

                                     GARY
                         The content filer has t'be written

                         off the satellite can be read by 
                         multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. 
                         Including whatever new hardware

                         It needs a more object-oriented 
                         language. This doesn't scale, does 
                         it?

                         You'd have to start practically from 
                         scratch. But this is all you'd be 
                         working on. No marketing meetings, 
                         no product seminars. We can't waste 
                         the time. Half the Valley's working 
                         on convergence. So're media

               Milo has a deer-in-the-headlights look.

                                     MILO
                         ...Ask you?

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM - DUSK

               As they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary 
               seems to read his mind.

                                     GARY
                         I know what people say, and not just 
                         the Justice Department. We clone 
                         ideas, inflict our second-rate 
                         versions on the world, we haven't 
                         done anything original since 1.0.

               Milo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor.

                                     GARY
                         Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put 
                         some of our apps up against anybody's. 
                         But is there some truth to it?

               They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo watches 
               Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow.

                         When you get to a certain age, you

                                     GARY
                              (pleased)
                         Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I 
                         wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 
                         in cyber-years. I look at you and 
                         see the things that got me here.
                              (the furrows deepen)
                         But somehow got away.

               EXT. CUPERTINO HILLS (SILICON VALLEY) - NIGHT

               A block of floodlit "tract mansions," Taco Bell palaces of 
               the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to 
               where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is 
               parked nearby. Milo is excited.

                                     MILO
                         If my dad'd leveled with me like 
                         that even once... The weird thing 
                         is, my fantasy he could somehow be 
                         like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, 
                         too.

                                     ALICE
                         I think that's great, Milo. I do.

                                     MILO
                         ...But?

                                     ALICE
                         Didn't you visit the campus?

                                     MILO
                         I forgot. That's why you have to 
                         help me decide.

                                     ALICE
                         No way. You have this -- destiny.

                                     MILO
                         C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny 
                         without you. My destiny would be 
                         dying at 20. From eating --

                                     ALICE
                         Don't bring that up. Like a different 
                         girlfriend would'd've let you die?

                                     MILO
                              (shrugs)
                         You saved my life in alot of ways.

               He's sweet. She kisses him. He holds onto her.

                                     ALICE
                         It's not just Gary that makes you 
                         wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big 
                         place. You might not even see him 
                         again.

               He'd hate to think that's true. But he manages a smile.

                                     MILO
                         I know.

               EXT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which 
               are tied to the roof. Milo & Alice stow a final piece.

                                     MILO
                         When's Brian coming for the TV?

                                     ALICE
                         Prob'ly waiting by the phone for 
                         Outpost to call. We'll leave it for 
                         him?

               As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb.

                                     ALICE
                         'Give you guys some time alone.

               She continues inside. He waits, watches Teddy cross the 
               sidewalk to join him.

                                     MILO
                         ...You got my E-mail?

                                     TEDDY
                         And your phone messages. You wanna 
                         do what you do, it's not a crime.

                                     MILO
                         Is that how Larry feels?

                                     TEDDY
                         Uh. Not exactly.

               A brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a 
               rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out.

                                     MILO
                         Wanted to say goodbye to him...

                                     TEDDY
                         Hey, we got seed money for the 
                         startup! A million-five!

               Milo grins, he high-fives Teddy.

                                     TEDDY
                         We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.
                              (he gives Milo the 
                              number)
                         You know what's the bad part? We 
                         can't talk about work anymore. We're 
                         competitors! The venture capitalists 
                         made us sign like 100 confidentiality 
                         forms.

                                     MILO
                         Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess 
                         we'll find out what else we have to 
                         talk about. Life stuff.

               They embrace. It's awkward, but it's heartfelt.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo enters, reading Teddy's phone number.

                                     MILO
                         Guess what? They got their --

               The rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV, 
               the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding 
               a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the 
                         Justice Department.
                              (gives Barton the 
                              water)
                         Sorry about the glass.

               Milo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ, 
               Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked.

                                     BARTON
                         Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a 
                         friend. Or maybe a supplicant.

                                     MILO
                         Right... What's that mean again?

                                     BARTON
                         Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with 
                         Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart 
                         as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell 
                         which technologies pose the threat 
                         of a monopoly. We need a really smart 
                         guy to help us pick our fights. I'm 
                         taking a shot in the dark, here. I 
                         can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. 
                         I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's 
                         the right thing to do.

                                     MILO
                              (fiddling with the 
                              card)
                         It's just -- I kind of feel the need 
                         to do something with my ability. 
                         Create something...

                                     BARTON
                         Like I said: shot in the dark.

               Milo tries to give back the card.

                                     BARTON
                         If you see something there that rubs 
                         you the wrong way? Do the right thing.

               And he goes.

                                     MILO
                         That took some fun out of --

                                     ALICE
                         We're not gonna let it.

               She kisses him. They head out. We linger. On TV a graphic 
               says: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: MASS SUICIDE - LIVE. Emergency 
               Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new 
               Mediterranean mansion. Footage shows bodies (including a few 
               children) on bunkbeds, uniformly shod in black Nikes.

                                     CNN VOICE

                         sedatives crushed in apple sauce. 
                         According to the cult's eerily 
                         professional website, it was "time 
                         to move on..."

               EXT. OUTPOST CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY

               Crane past identical, low, steel & glass buildings, amid the 
               vast lawns & fir trees... Past a building under 
               construction... To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising.

               INT./EXT. REDMOND'S CAR/CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

               Milo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour:

                                     REDMOND
                         There're 20 buildings, I mean not 
                         counting the Gyms, the Day Care, 
                         etc.

               The Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big 
               cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A 
               Teacher leads her little charges inside.

                                     REDMOND
                         Gary's put millions in there. And 
                         the people with kids? They're not 
                         hotshot geeks, they're just payroll 
                         clerks or whatever.

               Two Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the 
               Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19.

                                     REDMOND
                         You'll see alot of that: Department 
                         of Justice goons snooping around.

               The car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters.

               CLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO

               THEN TILT UP TO SHOW:

               EXT. BUILDING 20 QUAD - DAY

               The logo is of inlaid stone. Redmond & Milo walk over it. 
               Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a 
               small painting. Redmond wears a photo I.D. tag.

                                     REDMOND
                         So how'd you like the house?

                                     MILO
                         His Snapples were in alphabetical 
                         order.

                                     REDMOND
                              (he laughs)
                         Well, he micro-managed the company 
                         till it got too big...
                              (he opens the door)
                         'Guess he needs to micro-manage 
                         something.

               INT. BLDG. 20 LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               At the desk, a RECEPTIONIST looks up, stands to hang a 
               temporary ID pass around Milo's neck.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Milo, I'm Judith. Welcome!

               Milo smiles. Redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner 
               door (a security cam is at every door); he holds the door 
               open for Milo.

               INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               They walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where 
               Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations.

                                     REDMOND
                         Everybody has the same office, there's 
                         no dumbass corporate hierarchy.

               They pass a room in which Geeks play video games. Just outside 
               it, a chubby programmer, DESI, sips a Diet Coke.

                                     DESI
                         Get out while you can, dude!

                                     REDMOND
                         Desi, Milo.

                                     DESI
                         The guy who was at Gary's house?

               He bows deep, with mock-obeisance. Milo blushes, Redmond 
               laughs, he snags Milo's elbow. They walk again, passing a 
               service hall with a Civil Defense sign.

                                     REDMOND
                         Best bomb shelters in America, 
                         accessible from every building. You 
                         gotta figure we're a major target, 
                         right?

               ANOTHER HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

               Up the hall, a young woman (LISA) is about to go into her 
               office. She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in. 
               She's beautiful.

                                     REDMOND
                         Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you.

               As they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her 
               workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze.

                                     REDMOND
                         Every geek here's got a thing for 
                         Lisa. But that's about the biggest 
                         reaction she's had to anybody.

                                     MILO
                              (shy, changing the 
                              emphasis)
                         She's a programmer?

                         Heavy graphical background, doing 
                         design-interface for Skywire apps.

                         You'll be working with her.

                                     MILO
                         I've got a girlfriend, remember?

                                     REDMOND
                         Right. That's rare around here. You 
                         know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 
                         'Posties are married to Outpost.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - MOMENT LATER

               A handsome, modest office like all the others: workstation, 
               whiteboard, window. They enter.

                                     REDMOND
                         Here's your world.
                              (pointing at the desk)
                         Copy of Gary's book, also the audio 
                         version, narrated by Gary.

               Milo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highway 
               (Gary by a highway on its cover). As we look at it:

                                     VOICE (SHROT)
                         The card's encoded. Tells us who 
                         came through the door and when.

               INT. OFFICE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY - LATER

               In an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from 
               security cameras, BOB SHROT, 40, Head of Physical Security, 
               issues Milo his swipe card. Redmond watches.

                                     SHROT
                         Unauthorized entries sound like this.

               He drags the card through a sample slot, producing an 
               unbelievably loud, piercing EEEEEEEE. He shouts over it:

                                     SHROT
                         If you see a tailgater, report him.

                                     MILO
                         Tailgater?

                                     SHROT
                              (kills the alarm)
                         Somebody coming in on your swipe.
                              (gives Milo a photo 
                              ID)
                         You see somebody wandering around 
                         without ID, it's your duty to 
                         challenge him. I don't give a shit 
                         if you're a stock-option billionaire. 
                         If you don't challenge, I'll have 
                         your butt.

               INT. HALLWAY - LATER

                                     MILO
                         He seems a little -- tense.

                                     REDMOND
                         Geeks pull his chain cause he's non-
                         tech. Ex-cop or something. They moon 
                         cameras, or use ATM's as swipe cards. 
                         The cameras're our real security so 
                         he's a little demoralized.

               EXT. BUILDING 20/PARKING LOT - DAY

               As they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber-
               optic cable into the building under construction.

                                     MILO
                         What're they building?

                                     REDMOND
                         #21. Way behind schedule. It's top-
                         secret, but everybody knows it's a 
                         digital broadcast space. They see 
                         the dishes on top, the fiber optics 
                         going in.

                                     MILO
                         Gary's not into fiber optics. He's 
                         betting everything on the satellites.

                                     REDMOND
                         You wanna survive in the software 
                         business, you cover your bets... I 
                         gotta say, this is the weirdest car 
                         anybody ever requested.

               They approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming.

                                     REDMOND
                         Oh, right. Your girlfriend's an 
                         artist.

               INT. BLDG. 20 CAFETERIA - DAY

               Blond wood, smoked glass -- a room as sleek as the Geeks who 
               lunch here are nerdy. Milo and Redmond push trays.

                                     REDMOND
                         I phoned her at your hotel, told her 
                         about our corporate housing options. 
                         She sounds neat.

               Lisa's at a table, looking at Milo. When their eyes meet, 
               she busies herself, placing the plates back on her tray.

                                     MILO
                         ...She is.
                              (turning away from 
                              Lisa)
                         She is!

               Lisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo. At a 
               table, Randy and Phil note the "interaction." Meantime:

                                     REDMOND
                         'Might be some friction on the 
                         domestic front. You're expected you 
                         to put in ridiculous hours. People've 
                         accused us of breaking up 
                         relationships to get their undivided 
                         attention.

               He laughs.

               INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Lisa moves swiftly up the hall. She looks up it and down it 
               (making sure no one's looking) before ducking into

               MILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               She goes to the box on Milo's desk (his personal effects) -- 
               starts rooting through it.

               INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

               Redmond and Milo have eaten; Redmond stacks their plates.

                                     REDMOND
                         Your counselor'll fill you in on 
                         everything else. That's who you'll 
                         be working with almost daily.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - LATER

               Milo has fed the old Skywire disks into his machine. He reads 
               a complicated screen.

                                     VOICE
                         Busy?

               Milo looks up. It's Gary. Milo is thrilled.

                                     MILO
                         No! Just waiting for my counselor to 
                         come by and introduce himself.

                                     GARY
                         Okay. I'm Gary.

               Milo's smile deepens. Gary notices the small painting (by 
               Alice) hanging on the wall. He stares at it.

                                     GARY
                         'Think I should buy some originals?

                                     MILO
                         ...Do I?

                                     GARY
                         Somebody said I'm just another 
                         Philistine. With reproductions.

                                     MILO
                         That's insane. You're ahead of your 
                         time.

                                     GARY
                         That's what I told her. My wife.

               Milo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the 
               screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs. Boyd.

                                     GARY
                         'Thinks I'll be less of a control 
                         freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives 
                         me something else to obsess about...

               Milo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen.

                                     GARY
                         Anything we can salvage from the old 
                         code before you start fresh?

               Milo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor.

                                     MILO
                         Uh, might be one or two things.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. QUAD - OUTSIDE MILO'S OFFICE - LATER

               Two awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window.

                                     GEEK 1
                         He's been in there like an hour.

                         Shit.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               MILO SCROLLS THE SCREEN:

                         Could work with a new switch. There 
                         may be a few more things hidden.

                                     GARY
                         Don't spend too much time searching. 
                         You ever vetted somebody's old code 
                         before?
                              (when Milo shakes his 
                              head)
                         It's a different skill. Stay close 
                         to the surface. The best-hidden 
                         secrets are in plain sight. You know 
                         the best place to hide a leaf, right?
                              (when Milo shakes his 
                              head)

               INT. EMPTY HOUSE - EVENING

               We're in an old (empty) Craftsman house. Through a front 
               window, we see Alice lead Milo up a path. As they enter:

                                     ALICE
                         ...The corporate condos were as 
                         romantic as they sound.

               Milo's grinning as he takes in the house.

               THE BEDROOM - MOMENT LATER

               Windows give onto a garden with a small studio. Milo's still 
               beaming, Alice is pleased. Till he says:

                                     MILO
                         You know he's never been anybody's 
                         counselor before?

                                     ALICE
                         Milo! What about --?

               She gestures at what she hopes will be their home.

                                     MILO
                         Oh, It's great. It's great!
                              (they start to kiss, 
                              but:)
                         'Think I should tell him I learned 
                         everything using 1.0? Maybe I could 
                         show him one of my early programs.

               She pulls him back into the kiss.

               MONTAGE W/ MUSIC

               1.) MILO types intently in his office.

               2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to 
               the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks.

               3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book.

               4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 
               1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled 
               on it. Gary seems touched.

               INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) 
               Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is 
               reading from a document:

                                     DOJ AGENT
                         "Infotek's urgent need to license 
                         Outpost Office is such that we can 
                         use it as a tool in the current 
                         negotiation."
                              (looks up)
                         When you wrote the word "tool," what'd 
                         you mean by it?

               Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed.

                                     GARY
                         I don't remember.

                                     DOJ AGENT
                         What d'you think you meant by it?

                                     GARY
                         I'm confused. Am I supposed to 
                         speculate under oath?

               The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's 
               negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, 
               while offering nothing).

                                     OTHER AGENT
                         Since you didn't have an answer to 
                         that question, Mr. Boyd --

                                     GARY
                              ("confused" again)
                         Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't 
                         remember."

               The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open 
               door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to 
               hide his annoyance:

                                     DOJ AGENT
                         Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd?

               INT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

               Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it.

                                     PHIL
                         Your protege's moving so fast we can 
                         barely keep up with him.

               Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.

                                     GARY
                         This is good. Who did it?

                                     PHIL
                         'Start-up not 50 miles from here. 
                         Kid's on Prozac.

                                     GARY
                         Maybe we should all get on it.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters.

                                     GARY
                         How's it going?

                                     MILO
                         Maybe I'm going too fast.

                                     GARY
                              (sharply; incredulous)
                         Too fast? At least four companies're 
                         on the verge of workable convergence 
                         systems, Milo, they --

               Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales.

                                     GARY
                         Even when I had a hand in every aspect 
                         of the company I knew the one thing 
                         you can never control is somebody's 
                         creative process.

               Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just 
               wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop 
               obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," 
               engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more 
               engrossing than Skywire?)

                                     MILO
                         It's okay. Really.

                                     GARY
                              (reaching into his 
                              pocket)
                         Take a look at this. Slightly 
                         different approach.

               Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow.

                                     MILO
                         You did this -- overnight?

                                     GARY
                         You're making me young again.

               INT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               PAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled, 
               smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway.

                                     NEWS VOICE
                         ...A graduate of MIT, he was on the

                         warned not to drink and drive. (Etc.)

               Lisa watches the news report, knowingly.

               INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - DAY

               Lisa heads up the hall, carrying a CD-ROM.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Milo's typing.

                                     LISA
                         Milo?

               He looks. He stands.

                                     MILO
                         Lisa.

                                     MILO
                         You know mine.

                              (winces)
                         I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.

                                     LISA
                         I wouldn't worry about it. You've 
                         gotta figure most people around here 
                         were their teachers' pets.

                                     MILO
                         ...Were you?

                                     LISA
                         We moved around so much I barely 
                         knew my teachers.

                                     MILO
                         Me too! Were you an Army brat or 
                         something?

                                     LISA
                         ...Something like that. Yeah.

                                     MILO
                         Didn't mean to pry. I just have this 
                         theory. Some of us who got to good 
                         at this? We were -- escaping 
                         something.

               This seems to jolt her. She pales a little. What a mysterious 
               girl. But this only adds to her allure.

                                     MILO
                         Did I say something?

                                     LISA
                         No, I know what you mean. I used to 
                         spend my life wishing people could 
                         be like computers. Least they make 
                         sense. Sometimes you think they've 
                         betrayed you. Like a person would. 
                         But then you see, no, you just missed 
                         a step. You can go back and make it 
                         all work.

               This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it.

                                     MILO
                         I used to wish that. All the time.

               They're looking at each other: he gets self-conscious.

                                     MILO
                              (re: the CD-ROM)
                         What've you got there?

                                     LISA
                         Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? 
                         I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.

                                     MILO
                         Show me.

               They sit. As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking 
               at her. On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the 
               logo appears. It's struck by a bolt from the sky. The outpost 
               comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its 
               windows, a ringing phone. Finally, the word SKYWIRE burns 
               into it. It's neat, she's really good.

                                     MILO
                         Cool!

                                     LISA
                         Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, 
                         ranging from the narrowest bandwidth 
                         to --

               Simultaneously, they reach for the mouse. Their hands touch. 
               They look at each other. Something happened.

                                     MILO
                         ...Sh-Show me the next one.

               She nods, manipulates the mouse. He stares at the screen 
               strenuously, fighting the impulse to stare at Lisa.

               INT. ANTEROOM - GARY'S OFFICE

               Gary's SECRETARY types as Milo enters. She smiles at him.

                         Have a seat. He's with someone, but 
                         I know he wants to see you.

               INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gary's face is red. The two Lawyers who sat in on his 
               deposition are with him again.

                                     LAWYER
                         Because we bundled it, the judge is 
                         threatening to enjoin the whole --

                                     GARY
                         I'm confused, Ted.

               Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of 
               ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending.

                                     GARY
                         Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter 
                         12 by the time they could hope to 
                         enjoin? I'm very confused, because 
                         you said they'd be ready to settle.

               ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo hears Gary yelling behind the closed door. It's 
               indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit!" Milo 
               flips through a copy of Wired, trying to ignore it. The 
               Lawyers come out, passing swiftly, rather grimly.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Go on in.
                              (when Milo looks 
                              dubious)
                         He's always happy to see you.

               INT. GARY'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

               Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, pens, 
               etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open 
               doorframe.

                                     GARY
                         Milo. What's up?

                                     MILO
                         Well -- you sent for me.

                                     GARY
                         Right... Right.

               Still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives 
               it to Milo. Once again, Milo marvels.

                                     MILO
                         You really wrote this just today?

                                     GARY
                              (dark, unsmiling)
                         What're you implying.

                                     MILO
                              (taken aback)
                         Nothing!

               Their eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair.

                                     GARY
                         Everything I do is under scrutiny. 
                         The questions they ask, trying to 
                         make anything strategic look sordid.
                              (knits his brow)
                         I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in 
                         business try to get ahead?

                                     MILO
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I'm sure.

                                     GARY
                         The purpose of this company isn't to 
                         destroy our competitors any more 
                         than the purpose of living is to 
                         breath. But the software business is 
                         binary: you're a zero or a one. Being 
                         obsessive isn't a crime. It's a 
                         character trait.

               Milo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide his 
               discomfort. Gary watches him.

                                     GARY
                         It scales, don't you think?

                                     MILO
                         Definitely.

               He smiles. For the first time it looks forced.

               INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse. 
               Alice looks great. The Waiter pours wine.

                                     ALICE
                         This feels fairly grown up, I'd say.

               Milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass.

                                     MILO
                         To our new life.
                              (she's looking at him)
                         ...What's wrong?

                                     ALICE
                         That's what I need to ask you.
                              (when he says nothing)
                         You know you can't keep anything 
                         from me.

                                     MILO
                         He gave me some new code-fixes this 
                         morning. I said, "Did you really do 
                         this just today?" Cause I was 
                         impressed. He said "What're you 
                         implying?"

               She just looks at him. He grows a little defensive:

                                     MILO
                         It's the way he said it. Just the 
                         way my dad did, when he was caught 
                         in a lie. That's how you knew you 
                         were onto something ugly.

                                     ALICE
                              (just confused)
                         What would it mean, anyway? If he 
                         didn't write it?

                                     MILO
                         That's what I'm asking myself. Does 
                         he have some genius stowed away? Why 
                         not let him write Skywire.
                              (upset)
                         'Not saying it makes sense.

               A Busboy leaves a basket of rolls. Glum, preoccupied, Milo 
               takes one without looking, brings it to his lips --

                                     ALICE
                         Milo!

               He looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches.

                                     MILO
                         I'm so stupid.

               He throws the roll back into the basket.

                                     ALICE
                         He's your boss. He's not your --

                                     MILO
                              (he's nodding)
                         I know, I know.

                                     ALICE
                         If you can't deal with him on that 
                         basis, you better get a new counselor.

                                     MILO
                              (the very idea hurts)
                         Isn't that -- extreme?

                                     ALICE
                         What's extreme is what that ER doctor 
                         said when he pumped your stomach. 
                         Eat another sesame seed and that's 
                         it.

               We see the rolls: covered in seeds.

                                     ALICE
                         I mean, if one little comment from 
                         Gary is gonna upset you this much --

                                     MILO
                         You're right. It's -- a working 
                         relationship. Don't know what I was 
                         expecting.

               He smiles. But his heart's not in it. She hates to see him 
               suffer. She picks up her glass.

                                     ALICE
                         C'mon. Let's do the toast?

               EXT. TERRACE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY

               Milo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats. He 
               doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray.

                                     LISA
                         Did you wanna be alone?

                                     MILO
                         No. Please.

               He indicates she should sit.

                                     LISA
                         They just pushed up the schedule on 
                         Skywire apps. How fast are you going?

                                     MILO
                         "There is no second place." Plus 
                         every time I get jammed-up, Gary has 
                         an inspiration.
                              (looks at her, curious)
                         Is it like that with your counselor?

                                     LISA
                         Mine's not the CEO. He barely 
                         remembers to take a shower.

                                     MILO
                         Right, right. But does he ever just, 
                         like, hand you code?

                                     LISA
                         Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

                                     MILO
                              (he smiles)
                         You're compulsive.

                                     LISA
                         Mmm-more like -- I have a little 
                         trouble. Trusting people.

                                     MILO
                         Why's that?

                                     LISA
                         Long story. Not that interesting.

               She smiles charmingly to cover whatever she's feeling. The 
               more enigmatic she is, the more intrigued he is.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - DAY

               Milo and Lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with 
               Outpost logos. They laugh. We go nearer.

                                     MILO
                         So, when you were talking about 
                         wishing people were more like 
                         computers. Was that then? Or now?

                                     LISA
                         Then and now.
                              (when he looks at her)
                         But not right now.

               She maintains eye contact. Her meaning is clear.

                                     VOICE
                         Milo!

               Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot) 
               give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots 
               over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be 
               having been found in bed with a girl.

                                     BRIAN
                         Just dropped off a resume. Almost 
                         got in the front door.

               He looks at Lisa, back to Milo, wondering why he isn't being 
               introduced.

                                     MILO
                         You're living here?

                                     BRIAN
                         'Thought if I relocated it could 
                         help my case. I'm writing programs 
                         for the local public access station. 
                         Where any whack-job with 100 bucks 
                         gets his own show? God, does it suck.
                              (gives him a business 
                              card)
                         Can you help me?

                         Sure, I'll see what I can do.

               Seeing how flushed Milo is, Brian thinks he must have 
               blundered in on something. He starts to back away.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well I parked illegally. See y'later?

                                     MILO

                         She saved my life.

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The station is closed. Milo's car is parked, empty.

                                     MILO (O.S.)
                         How's it going down there?

               We find him, in an illuminated phone booth.

                                     TEDDY (ON THE PHONE)
                         I've been hacking for five night's 
                         straight, I'm really making headway.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. TEDDY'S LOFT (SUNNYVALE) - CONTINUOUS

               A funky space, posters on the wall, a red Stanford pennant, 
               rubber trees at either end of his desk.

                                     TEDDY
                         But these, like, White Supremacists 
                         trashed my office, last week.

                                     MILO
                         What?!

               On the wall beyond Teddy the word GOOK (in blood red) has 
               been covered over with paint but still bleeds through.

                                     TEDDY
                         They're in the neighborhood. They 
                         usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.

                                     MILO
                         Jesus, Teddy.

                                     TEDDY
                         I'm cool. They didn't touch the 
                         machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't 
                         know what they were. So, you a Moonie 
                         yet?
                              (he waits)
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         I met this girl.

                                     TEDDY
                         What? Come on. Is it serious?

                                     MILO
                         I don't know.

                                     TEDDY
                         Did you tell Alice?

                                     MILO
                         No! I keep thinking it'll go away. 
                         But there's this -- connection. She's 
                         been hacking since she was little, 
                         she had to move around a lot. Plus I 
                         see her every day, we're working on 
                         the same program. She's -- beautiful.

                                     TEDDY
                         A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound 
                         paranoid, or like a pig, but what're 
                         the chances?

                                     MILO
                         What d'you mean?

                                     TEDDY
                         I dunno. I guess Larry's got me 
                         totally suspicious of that place.

                                     MILO
                         What does that mean?

                                     TEDDY
                         Milo, geeks don't have two 
                         girlfriends. Most don't have one.

                                     MILO
                         I didn't plan this.

               Through a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad.

                         What'd the girl say?

                                     PHIL
                         There may be a little less trust 
                         after your outburst.

               We are

               INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code.

                                     PHIL
                         Hasn't affected his work, though.

                                     GARY
                         Nothing does. Still. I want him to 
                         like me.

               Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary.

               EXT. BUILDING #20 PARKING LOT - EVENING

               Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo 
               to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems 
               to be -- apologizing.

               EXT./INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING

               Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice 
               what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is 
               waiting for him. She's white.

                                     MILO
                         ...What's wrong?

               She doesn't know how to say it.

                                     MILO
                         What!

                                     ALICE
                         Teddy was killed last night.

                                     MILO
                         What're you -- what?

                                     ALICE
                         It was a hate crime.

               Milo is staggered. She moves to him...

                                     ALICE
                         I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

               He hangs onto her, for support.

               INT. LOFT - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

               A mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have 
               gathered. In the BG, Teddy's Dad weeps volubly.

               INT. TEDDY'S WORKSPACE - CONTINUOUS

               Teddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red 
               Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit, 
               peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall.

                                     NELSON
                         They trashed his hard disk, all his 
                         back-ups. Nothing's left.

                                     MILO
                         They caught the guys?

               Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin-
               headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's.

                                     NELSON
                         It's an airtight case. They found 
                         the weapon with Teddy's blood on it 
                         and their fingerprints. They'd been 
                         arrested twice for beating-up Asians. 
                         How come they weren't in jail?

               Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board.

                                     MILO
                         He told me about the break-in. He 
                         didn't seem to take it that seriously.

                                     NELSON
                         You guys don't take anything seriously 
                         do you? That's not on a hard drive?

               Milo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway.

                                     ALICE
                         Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's 
                         time to go to scatter the ashes.

               Milo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to 
               the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he 
               sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up.

                                     MILO
                         I didn't know he was working with 
                         fiber optics.

               But when he looks up, Nelson's gone.

                                     ALICE
                         We gotta go too, honey.

               As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the 
               filament in his suit pocket.

               EXT. BLUFF OVER THE PACIFIC - DAY

               A raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind 
               a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's 
               Prayer.

               EXT. BLUFF - LATER

               Milo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's 
               okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the 
               cars.

                                     MILO
                         I know you lost all his work. Maybe 
                         I could come down here and --

                                     LARRY
                         You are naive. Look at your employment 
                         contract: you can't work anywhere 
                         else in this field for at least few 
                         years.
                              (he smiles sadly)
                         Not that I don't miss you.

                                     MILO
                         Just thought his work should go on.

                                     LARRY
                         He was on the verge of something, 
                         too. He was gonna show us the next 
                         day. He said "The answer's not in 
                         the box, it's in the band." Know 
                         what it means?

                                     MILO
                         It's only meaningful when you've got 
                         40,000 lines of code to back it up.

                                     LARRY
                         Man, could he write code. Totally 
                         elegant. He had his own style.

                                     MILO
                         Those really weird, short lines.

               They smile. For a moment, they've brought Teddy back to life. 
               Alice comes up from behind, to fetch Milo.

                                     LARRY
                         Take good care of this guy.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 - DAY

               Arriving for work, Milo sees Outpost flags at half mast.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               As Milo comes up the hall, Lisa is standing there. We get 
               the feeling she's been waiting for him.

                                     LISA
                         You okay?

               He looks at her, perhaps hearing Teddy's words ("what're the 
               chances?"). He nods, moves on. She watches him head up the 
               hall.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Milo types. There is a rapping on the doorframe. Gary.

                                     GARY
                         I heard what happened.

                                     MILO
                         Were the flags for Teddy?

               Gary nods. Spontaneously Milo stands, hugs Gary.

                                     GARY
                         Had you talked to him much lately?

                                     MILO
                         Just once. 'Guess I was worried we 
                         didn't have anything to talk about, 
                         since work was off-limits. Non-
                         disclosure.

                                     GARY
                         Did you?

                                     MILO
                         Talk about work? Never!

                                     GARY
                         I meant did you find other stuff to --

                                     MILO
                         Oh. Yeah.

                                     GARY
                         You've been coming in early.

                                     MILO
                         It helps. Alice said it would help. 
                         To focus on something.
                              (a little guilty)
                         'Don't know what I'd do without her.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               Milo sits on the couch, in dim light. Alice comes in.

                                     ALICE
                         You okay?
                              (sits by him, holds 
                              him)
                         I miss him, too.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DINING ROOM TERRACE - DAY

               Milo eats alone. Through the window, he sees Lisa inside. 
               She's eating alone, too. Gary comes trotting up.

                                     GARY
                         Milo?

               He is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out.

                                     MILO
                         Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of 
                         code there...

                                     GARY
                         34,000. But they're real short lines. 
                         'Just came out that way.

               Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of 
               like -- Teddy's.

                                     GARY
                         Been thinking about the push mechanism 
                         in the handler. And it came over me: 
                         it's in the wrong place.

                                     MILO
                              (an uncertain smile)
                         The wrong place?

                                     GARY
                         The answer's not in the box. It's in 
                         the band.

               Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a 
               reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but 
               Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the 
               very ground is going out from under him.

               Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And 
               Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the words 
               Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes.

               Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He 
               perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling, 
               saying "See you later." And he's gone.

               Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.

                                     LISA (O.S.)
                         Milo? You okay?

               It strikes him she always shows up at these moments. He 
               gathers his wits before looking up.

                                     MILO
                         Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something.

               INT./EXT. MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY

               Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits 
               HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's 
               about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded 
               on the receiver.

               He throws it down like it's contaminated.

               EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children. 
               Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle.

               EXT. INT./FRONT DOOR/FOYER - DAY

               He fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside:

                                     MILO
                         Alice? Alice!

               He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window, 
               painting in the studio.

               EXT./INT. BACK GARDEN/STUDIO - MOMENT LATER

               He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She 
               does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits 
               for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak.

               EXT. BACK GARDEN - LATER

               He paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but 
               doesn't want to appear unsympathetic.

                                     ALICE
                         Are you saying you think they had 
                         something to do with his death? Nelson 
                         said it was an airtight case.

                                     MILO
                         I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- 
                         maybe they hired those guys.

                                     ALICE
                         I can't see Outpost putting its 
                         reputation in the hands of people 
                         like that.

                                     MILO
                         I don't know! I just know it was 
                         Teddy's code. All these ideas flying 
                         in from everywhere. You know how he 
                         says "Any kid working in his garage 
                         can put us out of business?" It's 
                         like they know what every kid's doing.

                                     ALICE
                         They hack into people's programs?

                                     MILO
                         Nobody does work like this on-line. 
                         It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. 
                         Self-contained. They'd have to be, 
                         like, watching people. Physically.
                              (he freezes)
                         Oh Jesus.

               INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging 
               there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket. 
               He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic 
               strand (from Teddy's floor). Shows it to her.

                                     MILO
                              (almost silently)
                         It's a camera.

               EXT. BACK GARDEN - AGAIN

               They've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging 
               his paranoia.

                                     MILO
                         It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- 
                         a surveillance post or something. 
                         That's why they have the dishes on 
                         top.

                                     ALICE
                         You're scaring me. I think we should 
                         just go.

                                     MILO
                         Go where? You can't get away from 
                         people like this.

                                     ALICE
                         "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking 
                         about.

                                     MILO
                              (it really hurts)
                         You think I don't know that?

                                     ALICE
                         Milo. Why would he --

                                     MILO
                         How should I know? "Solving a 
                         problem," I guess. Or needing to 
                         control everything. I don't know.
                              (can't think about it)
                         I've gotta get in there.

                                     ALICE
                         Even if all this were true. There're 
                         20 other buildings. All of them filled 
                         with computers and --

                                     MILO
                         It's the only one with dishes on the 
                         roof. The studio's a front. That's 
                         why they keep postponing its opening.
                              (muttered, obsessive)
                         ...gotta get in there.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents 
                         are all over the place. How could 
                         they hope to hide a surveillance 
                         post?
                              (as he mulls this)
                         And how can you get in there, anyway? 
                         With the cameras and the swipe cards --

                                     MILO
                         I can't just walk away!

                                     ALICE
                         You can't just walk in, either.

                                     MILO
                         They stop the construction work at 
                         six or seven. The parking lot's mostly 
                         clear by two or three in the morning. 
                         Even the early Geeks don't get there 
                         before five.

                                     ALICE
                         Is it two? Or is it three? Have you 
                         ever really noticed?

               He knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a 
               space-cadet. She tries to hold him. But he wriggles away.

                                     MILO
                         No! I can't just keep my head in the 
                         sand. That's how I got into this 
                         mess.

               He paces, he thinks. She watches him, worried.

                                     MILO
                         I know how to get in there. But you've 
                         gotta help me.

                                     ALICE
                              (scared, reluctant)
                         ...Whaddo I do?

                                     MILO
                         So you believe me?

               She can't lie. She shakes her head.

                                     ALICE
                         Just tell me what to do.

               BEGIN MONTAGE:

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Standing at his window, Milo can see #21. Workers in Hardhats 
               come out of it, carrying lunchboxes. Milo holds a small 
               writing pad. He notes the time.

               EXT. SUBURBAN MAIN STREET - DAY (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice parks in front of a drugstore. As she gets out of the 
               car, she looks around uneasily.

               INT. DRUGSTORE - (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice is at the counter, buying a wind-up alarm clock.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (CONT. MONTAGE)

               Milo watches a car pull out of the parking lot, leaving only 
               one or two others. He writes down the time.

               INT. TOYSTORE - (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice is at the counter, among children and mothers, 
               purchasing a chemistry set.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               He watches a SECURITY GUARD (DELBERT) go into #21 on his 
               rounds, notes the time: 3:45 AM.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice, wearing dishwashing gloves, ties the alarm clock to a 
               small Tupperware container with copper wire.

               Milo (wearing latex gloves) is at the sink, mixing chemicals 
               from the toy chemistry set. Alice approaches with the 
               container affixed to the clock. As she holds it out Milo 
               pours the mixture into it.

                                                                SHORT FADE:

               OVER BLACK we hear ticking. The screen lightens to show:

               INT. SUPPLY CLOSET (BUILDING 20)

               Milo's alarm clock is set for 11:00. It sits amid mops and 
               cleaning products.

               INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - DAY

               Milo stands in the open door of a refrigerator, as if 
               searching for a soda. He's looking up the hall, waiting for 
               someone. He consults his watch. 10:53.

                                     MILO
                         Come on.

               Here comes a GUARD; he nods to Milo as he passes. The Guard 
               opens a door with his card. Milo rushes through the door on 
               the Guard's swipe -- "tailgating."

                                     GUARD
                         Sir, you gotta use your own --
                              (noticing)
                         Where's your ID?

               Milo cops an attitude. He's not completely convincing.

                                     MILO
                         Do you know who I am?

                                     GUARD
                         It's my job, I gotta --

                                     MILO
                              (he's getting better)
                         The kind of stock options I'm sitting 
                         on?

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Bob Shrot, the ex-cop in charge of physical security, looks 
               up as the Guard escorts Milo into the room.

               INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

               The bomb explodes. The blast is tiny but loud (glass cleaning 
               bottles ring; plastic bottles moan).

               INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo sits, watches Shrot encode a new card for him, finding 
               his info on a terminal. On a monitor behind Shrot, Milo sees 
               Programmers being ushered out of the building.

                                     SHROT
                         Every geek has to try this once to 
                         show me how smart he is --

               ANOTHER GUARD rushes in.

                                     ANOTHER GUARD
                         There was an explosion in a Y-sector 
                         closet, we're evacuating the whole 
                         sector.

               Shrot comes to his feet, grabs a holster (with gun) off a 
               shelf. Milo, looking flummoxed, stands.

                                     SHROT
                         Un-nh, can't wander around without 
                         ID now. Just park your ass in that 
                         chair.

               Milo sits. Shrot goes out with the Guard.

                                     GUARD (O.S.)
                         Whole place reeks of fuckin' ammonia.

               Milo moves quickly to the wall, reads a chart with the Guards' 
               Schedule, runs his finger down it til he finds the name of 
               the Guard on the 3 AM shift: DELBERT, KEN.

               INT. HALLWAYS - A FEW QUICK CUTS - CONTINUOUS

               Guards open closet doors, shine their flashlights.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo has moved to Shrot's seat. He's encoding a fresh card 
               with Ken Delbert's information.

               INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Panning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at 
               a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing 
               the system with his unique concentration.

               Panning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers 
               enjoying themselves on the lawn. It's a rare, exciting event: 
               they jump around, miming explosions.

               INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the 
               debris, puts them in a tray.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On 
               the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a 
               room under construction...

               He pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks 
               PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders 
               through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves 
               backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty 
               hallway), stops the tape.

               INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Gary, Randy & Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him.

                                     RANDY
                         What is it?

                                     SHROT
                         Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. 
                         Right by the civil defense sign? 
                         Some geek's idea of irony. I been 
                         saying we need a camera in this hall.

                                     RANDY
                         There's nothing in this hall. 
                         Someone's pulling your chain, as 
                         usual.

                                     SHROT
                              (thinking aloud)
                         Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in 
                         my office. He was tailgating, so I --

               Gary explodes, with incredulity.

                                     GARY
                         Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to 
                         think.

               Gary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned.

                                     RANDY
                         That kid's the great white hope.

                                     SHROT
                         I could get it out of him.

                                     RANDY
                         You're not listening.

               Randy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if 
               his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's 
               innocence, he isn't.

               He walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo reads a warning message. DOWNLOADING PLAYBACK STREAM TO 
               RECORD CYCLE WILL CAUSE BIT OVERLOAD. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED? 
               Y/N. He types Y.

               The glitch freezes the tape (we see it lock into place): it 
               shows the empty hallway.

               INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               They've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall 
               as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly.

               He knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make 
               cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo immobilizes another camera in #21... and another.

               INT. HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

               Shrot rounds the corner. His office is in view, now.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, at the keyboard, closes up windows, one by one.

               INT. SECURITY OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo. 
               We assume his POV as he does so:

               Milo sits in the chair where Shrot left him.

                                     MILO
                         Everything okay?

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Pan off the clock (3:20 AM) to find Milo at his desk, looking 
               at the clock with a certain dread. It's time.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - NIGHT

               Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling 
               nervously with the dummied swipe card.

               Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping 
               to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on.

               Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is 
               around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible 
               through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with 
               cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression 
               seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw 
               racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his 
               James Bond BMW...

               Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the 
               card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm?

               He slides the card, the door clicks.

               INT. BLDG. 21 - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               He enters: concrete floor, unpainted walls, construction 
               lights. At the inner door he looks up at the camera.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A MONITOR

               that shows us where Milo stands, minus Milo. Widen:

               INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               A GUARD packs up his stuff, getting ready to go home. The 
               new guard, KEN DELBERT enters.

                                     DELBERT
                         How's it goin'?

                                     GUARD
                              (shaking out his cup)
                         Big night. Switched from tea to 
                         coffee. Brought new meaning to my 
                         work.

                                     DELBERT
                         Yeah? Maybe I'll start my rounds 
                         with #21 tonight.

                                     GUARD
                         You are a wild man.

               INT. BLDG. 21 - INNER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls, bare floors, 
               unconnected wires. The only illumination is from construction 
               lights on the concrete floor. Opening doors, he sees:

               Bare rooms. Wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment, 
               bundles of wire hanging out. In other words: the building is 
               as advertised, so far.

               EXT. BUILDING 20 - NIGHT

               Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean-
               swept path that leads to #21.

               INT. BLDG. 21 - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Milo nears a set of double-doors at the end of the hall. He 
               hears a low ominous hum from within. Convinced he's found 
               something, he quickens his pace. He's about to swipe his 
               card when a beam of light bounces along the wall.

               He presses himself into an alcove. Through a chink in the 
               unfinished wall he sees:

               Delbert come in the front door. His rounds consist of shining 
               his torch up at the cameras, making sure the red lights are 
               on.

               He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath).

               Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the humming 
               gets louder.

               ON MILO: pressing himself into the alcove.

               Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall... exits the 
               building.

               Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall. 
               Using the card, he enters

               A BIG SPACE

               A studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed in 
               but not plaster-boarded. The portentous hum comes from around 
               a corner. He approaches, convinced the answer lies here. 
               Clearing the wall he sees:

               A squat emergency generator sitting on the floor, powering 
               construction lights. Something you'd buy at Sears.

               EXT. #21 ENTRANCE/A MOMENT LATER - (BINOCULAR SHOT)

               Through infra-red binoculars we see Milo come out, looking 
               left and right, to make sure he hasn't been observed.

                                     VOICE (RANDY)
                         Well. Now he knows: nothin' in there.

               We are

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS

               Randy turns back into the room, where Phil is sifting through 
               papers spread over a coffee table.

                                     RANDY
                         Maybe he'll get back to work.

                                     PHIL
                         Speaking of which...

                                     RANDY
                         Yeah, yeah.

               Randy pulls the blinds shut, joins Phil.

               EXT. QUAD - CRANE SHOT CONTINUOUS

               From a high angle, we track Milo, as he walks along the path 
               to a bench. The camera passes briefly behind a dark object 
               in the foreground (dog sculpture) as we track him.

               QUAD - TIGHTER - CONTINUOUS

               Milo sags onto the bench. He stares out, perplexed, suffering. 
               Then he knits his brow. He seems to be studying -- the ground.

               Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the 
               looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care.

               He stands up, turns around. REVERSE ON:

               The whimsical canine. Push toward it's ears cocked to the 
               sky... Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete, 
               but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal: 
               satellite dish.

                                     MILO
                              (muttering)
                         ...in a tree...

               EXT. DAY CARE CENTER - A MOMENT LATER

               At the entrance, Milo applies the swipe-card.

               INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

               He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. 
               Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, 
               into the

               COMPUTER ROOM

               20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed 
               table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no 
               expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital 
               screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour 
               drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). 
               There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of 
               the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).

               Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. 
               Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings 
               are of desks or tables with computers.

               Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a 
               workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant 
               at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. 
               Milo passes it. And comes back to it.

               Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still 
               occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the 
               bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- 
               numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is 
               a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his 
               frustration evident.

               As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the 
               screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve 
               into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in 
               Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).

               When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK 
               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the 
               screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All 
               of them show variations on a theme:

               A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a 
               programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various 
               shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed 
               view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are 
               present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A 
               Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Phil and Randy work at the coffee table.

                                     PHIL
                         Did you download Corey? In San Jose?

                                     RANDY
                         Damn. 'Have to go back over there.
                              (he stands, stretches)
                         Be so much easier if we could walk 
                         in the front door.

                                     PHIL
                         You don't look anything like a three-
                         year-old.

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and 
               obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a 
               graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: 
               TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.

               He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal 
               Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows 
               open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an 
               award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video 
               stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug-
               shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being 
               interrogated.

               In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld 
               crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. 
               "DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some 
               "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without 
               audio.

               He types some more.

               In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding 
               the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: 
               "Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter 
               Type PBX-R17."

               His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware 
               substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his 
               swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he 
               sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.

               INT. BUILDING 20 - SERVICE HALL - CONTINUOUS

               Randy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door 
               with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card.

               INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan 
               Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in 
               the 2nd window: a steel hasp.

               Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is 
               reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from 
               the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within.

               He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its 
               magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We 
               hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of 
               a serene, eminently sane female:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- run this methamphetamine lab known 
                         to Federal Authorities, per ND 47, 
                         from which we removed the implement, 
                         fingerprints intact.

               Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the 
               time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall 
               then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this 
               footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always 
               present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.)

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         FBI footage, procured by ND 47, shows 
                         the aftermath of an Aryan Nations' 
                         killing in Denver. Note the evidence 
                         of torture, which is typical.

               Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how 
               racial killings are done.

               He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls.

               It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel.

               INT. STAIRWELL/BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

               Still whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a 
               vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc.)

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing 
               at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- complete immersion in code-writing 
                         renders him both unobservant and 
                         suggestible [click]. On two occasions 
                         he went truant from classes to attend 
                         Comix Conventions.

               The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow: 
               he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking 
               to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro.

               What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost 
               urgently, till the narration crackles back on:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- Rebecca P, a Connecticut art stu- 
                         dent facing Federal drug charges, 
                         whose records were supplied to us by 
                         N.D. 47.

               He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen 
               Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo 
               subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what 
               his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR (O.S.)
                         Armed with his personal files, she 
                         was easily able to ingratiate herself 
                         with the socially maladroit Milo --

               The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and 
               ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's 
               waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, 
               Milo jams the card in deeper:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         ...she planted the sesame seed both 
                         to test the extent of his proclivity 
                         and to provide a bonding experience, 
                         since she would quote "save his life."

               Milo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time ER 
               footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping, 
               dying...

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- should it be needed Milo's allergy 
                         is the ideal --

               The audio crackles out. But Milo doesn't have the heart to 
               bring it back: he can fill in the rest.

               INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

               Randy traverses a well-lit tunnel. Still whistling.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY CARE CENTER - NIGHT

               Numb now, Milo clicks randomly: crime footage, personal 
               records, animations -- it all flies by with Chuck Worman-
               like speed.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR

                         from kidney failure.

               Milo closes his eyes, leans back: overwhelmed. Suddenly he 
               sits forward, whispers almost fervently as he types:

                                     MILO
                         Please don't be one of them.

               INT. DAY-CARE - UNDERGROUND ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Camera moves slowly through stacks of pre-school supplies, 
               toward a windowed door at the back of the room.

               RANDY appears in the window, lit ominously from below. He 
               applies his swipe card.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo watches footage of Lisa taken by surveillance cam- eras: 
               she is outside #21, trying to peek in the door.

               In one window, footage of Lisa casing the hallway before 
               going into Milo's office; in another, footage of her eating 
               lunch with Milo.

                         key employees.

               Milo clicks. A MAN's pair of mug shots appear. In the other 
               window, a grade-school yearbook photo of Lisa.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         In August '86 Lisa informed her mother 
                         of the sexual molestation by her 
                         stepfather, and of his threat to 
                         kill her should she tell anyone.

               Milo watches streaming local news footage of a man being 
               taken from a courtroom in shackles (jerky, grainy). He's 
               lost the audio, but doesn't need it, anymore.

               INT. DAY-CARE STAIRWELL

               Randy climbs up to the main floor... whistling.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo watches eerie crime-scene footage: a Girl with her throat 
               slashed.

               But then, hearing nearly-distant whistling, he clicks on 
               windows furiously: closing them.

               INT. DAY CARE BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Randy rounds a corner. He enters the

               COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The screens show the children's contour images, again. Where's 
               Milo?

               Randy takes a seat at the same console Milo was at, and begins 
               to type. Camera booms slowly down beneath table-level to 
               find:

               MILO hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white, 
               as he clings to metal table braces. The toes of his sneakers 
               are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower 
               and the table bottom.

               Randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward Milo's back. 
               Milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters.

               RANDY: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work, zooms in on 
               his screen to begin collecting his code.

               MILO: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow 
               and, worse, on his hands. They're giving way.

               RANDY: clicks. A printer across the room start making a hard-
               copy of the purloined code.

               MILO: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed 
               on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from 
               its ports. He tries to lift it back up with heels of his 
               shoes.

               RANDY: knits his brow as his screen flickers. He keeps typing, 
               but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the 
               table.

               MILO: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels, 
               while trying to maintain his balance...

               RANDY: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits 
               keys. Just as he is about to clear the level of the table -- 
               the screen re-illumines. He comes back up.

               MILO: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels 
               his hands slipping...

               RANDY: closes up the window...

               MILO: flops to the carpet(!) just as --

               RANDY pushes away from the table... From the floor

               MILO watches him walk over to the printer, collect his 
               hardcopy, and disappear from view.

               Milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes.

               BACK ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo traces Randy's steps. He sees the door with the Civil 
               Defense sticker, intuits how Randy got here, i.e, how one 
               moves, unobserved, between the Day Care and #20.

               He sags against the wall. Wondering what to do, now.

               EXT./INT. MILO'S CAR/STREET - DAWN

               Milo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up 
               the street. How can he go in there?

               He puts the car in gear, does a U-Turn.

               EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - SEATTLE - EARLY MORNING

               The Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government 
               building. Not many people are around, yet. A Janitor hoses 
               down the sidewalk.

               INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - RECEPTION AREA MORNING

               Milo slides a business card across a reception desk. It's 
               the one the rumpled Prosecutor, Lyle Barton, gave him that 
               day in Palo Alto.

                                     MILO (O.S.)
                         He gave me this. 'Said I should come 
                         see him if --

                                     DOJ RECEPTIONIST
                         He's not in yet.

                                     MILO
                         Can I wait in his office?

                                     DOJ RECEPTIONIST
                         It's locked, dear.

               He looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened.

                                     MILO
                         Please.

                                     DOJ RECEPTIONIST
                         Wait in his outer office.

               INT. BARTON'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

               Milo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping. Hearing Barton's 
               voice, he comes to his feet. Barton enters with a Co-Worker, 
               holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of 
               a case.

                                     CO-WORKER
                         Do I make the call, or do you?

               Milo is relieved the second he sees Barton's kindly face.

                                     MILO
                         Mr. Barton, do you remember me?

                                     BARTON
                         ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?

                                     MILO
                         Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

                                     BARTON
                         Give me two seconds with Lacy here?
                              (unlocks his door)
                         Go on in, I won't be a moment.

               Milo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague.

                                     BARTON (O.S.)
                         I'll make the call, but I think you 
                         need to send a Fax first (etc.).

               INT. BARTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo paces. He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and 
               photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity: 
               pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the 
               Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton 
               with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the photo, 
               till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey: 
               ND 47.

               Milo's smile fades. It takes a moment before he even hears 
               Barton behind him.

                                     BARTON
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

                                     BARTON
                         Have a seat.

               As Milo takes the seat in front of the desk (mind spinning) 
               Barton moves to his own chair.

                                     BARTON
                         What seems to be the problem? You 
                         look a little upset.

                                     MILO
                         I am. I am, sir.

               What's he gonna say?

                                     BARTON
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         My friend, my best friend, Teddy, 
                         was killed in Silicon Valley.

                                     BARTON
                         My goodness.

                                     MILO
                         It was racially motivated. He's 
                         Chinese. He was. And... I know 
                         sometimes the FBI gets involved with 
                         that. Don't they?

                                     BARTON
                         If there's a Civil Rights violation. 
                         But generally we let the local police 
                         and DA do their work first.

                                     MILO
                         I -- just wanna help bring these 
                         guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.

                                     BARTON
                         Let me look into it, see what's being 
                         done. Frankly, it's not my area.

                                     MILO
                              (he gets up)
                         'Just didn't know who else to talk 
                         to.

                                     BARTON
                              (circles an arm over 
                              Milo)
                         And Outpost? You're happy there?

                                     MILO
                         Yes sir.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Alice is on the phone in the front room. Agitated, she puffs 
               on a pencil (surrogate cigarette). We hear Phil through the 
               receiver:

                                     PHIL (ON THE PHONE)
                         'Didn't mention he was going to the 
                         Justice Department?

                                     ALICE
                         No.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                     PHIL
                         Not like him, is it? To do a thing 
                         like that without telling you. You're 
                         not losing your hold on him, are 
                         you?

                                     ALICE
                         He'll tell me when he gets home.

                                     PHIL
                         That'll be a test, won't it?

                                     ALICE
                         Instead of busting my chops you should 
                         do something about that girl. Fire 
                         her. Or something.

                                     PHIL
                         Lisa's an extremely valuable member 
                         of the Skywire team. We've got our 
                         eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.

                                     ALICE
                              (as she hangs up)
                         Prick.

               EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Milo comes up the path. He pauses as he nears the door: he's 
               not sure he can pull this off.

               INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               As Milo enters, Alice rushes to meet him.

                                     ALICE
                         It's almost nine, I've been so 
                         worried!
                              (she takes his hands)
                         What did you see in there?

                                     MILO
                         Nothing.

                                     ALICE
                         Nothing?

               She watches him as he collapses onto the couch.

                                     MILO
                         It's what they said it is. An 
                         unfinished broadcast studio. You 
                         were right... I just drove to Seattle 
                         and back.

                                     ALICE
                         ...Why?

                                     MILO
                         Remember Lyle Barton?

               She shakes her head.

                                     MILO
                         The Justice Department guy who came 
                         to the apartment when --

                                     ALICE
                         I remember.

                                     MILO
                         After I broke into 21 -- which was 
                         insane, thank God they didn't catch 
                         me! -- I just drove around. Trying 
                         to figure out what possessed me. You 
                         know what? I've been putting my own 
                         guilt on Gary.

                                     ALICE
                         Guilt?

                                     MILO
                              (quietly)
                         If I'd stayed down there, maybe this 
                         wouldn't've happened.

                                     ALICE
                         Poor baby. You know that's not true.

               She sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly. He 
               closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch. 
               Then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers.

               But he can't stand it. He gets up, looks out the window.

                                     MILO
                         I thought, instead of indulging all 
                         these paranoid delusions, risking my 
                         job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I 
                         should do something useful with my 
                         grief. Help them find Teddy's killers.

               He doesn't see her smile: is that all. Assuming an 
               appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him:

                                     ALICE
                         I was so worried about you.

               She turns him around, kisses him. Her eyes are closed. His 
               remain open. He's looking at her. Trying to comprehend the 
               treachery.

               She touches him, breathes heavily. She wants more than kisses: 
               to prove to herself how wrong Phil was, her professional 
               pride insulted. Or perhaps it's more personal than that, 
               especially with Lisa as a potential rival.

                                     MILO
                              (through their kisses)
                         ...been such a long night.

               But she doesn't stop. She moans as she presses herself to 
               him: wants proof of his devotion.

               INT. BEDROOM - LATER

               He's on top of her in the moment just after. Her eyes are 
               closed. He stares at her -- glares at her -- with what we 
               recognize as spent anger.

                                     ALICE
                         That was -- different.

                                     MILO
                         ...Different?

               Shit. She knows.

                                     ALICE
                         You didn't feel it? So intense.

               What's clear is, she liked it. A clap of thunder takes us 
               to:

               EXT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

               It's pouring. Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking 
               in the window at someone.

               INT. PIZZA PLACE - MOMENT LATER

               Lisa reads a paperback at a table, a slice of pizza on her 
               plate, an umbrella hooked to her chair. Sensing someone 
               standing over her, she looks up. She smiles.

                                     LISA
                         So you're not avoiding me.

               Milo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start.

                                     LISA
                         What's wrong?

               He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He 
               speaks very quietly.

                                     MILO
                         I snuck into #21.

                                     LISA
                         Why would you do a thing like --

                                     MILO
                         You thought about it too. You've 
                         been suspicious for a while. But 
                         it's not happening in there. It's 
                         happening in the Day Care.

                                     LISA
                         The Day Care?

               Two Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a 
               laptop case slung over his shoulder.

                                     MILO
                         Can we go someplace else?

               EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT

               They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off 
               the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace.

                                     MILO
                         It's easy to know who the smart geeks 
                         are, the schools tell 'em. They upload 
                         medical files, school records, 
                         pharmacy files. They'd be happy just 
                         to steal code forever. But when a 
                         program gets close to fruition. Like 
                         Teddy. He was almost there.

                                     LISA
                         But why would they --?

                                     MILO
                         You know. There is no second place. 
                         And what's the risk? The killings're  
                         undetectable, they're hand-tailored, 
                         they make "sense." I mean, they're 
                         in the information business. They 
                         have scenarios for all of us, too. 
                         In case we find out too much.

               She's peering at him. He reads her mind.

                                     MILO
                         I'm not one of them. Not trying to 
                         "suss you out."

               She wants to believe him.

                                     MILO
                         They killed my best friend! I'm living 
                         with somebody they pay to go to bed 
                         with me. Can't you trust somebody 
                         just once? I don't wanna be alone 
                         here.

               His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she 
               can't quite do it.

                                     LISA
                         I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry.

               She smiles sadly as she backs away.

                                     MILO
                              (forcefully)
                         I know why you're so secretive. Why 
                         you won't let anybody near you.
                              (quieter)
                         I know what he did to you.

                                     LISA
                         Oh yeah?

               She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes.

                                     LISA
                         So that's in my -- file?

               He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She 
               shakes her head: no.

                                     LISA
                         Is that my -- scenario?
                              (when he hesitates)
                         Tell me.

                                     MILO
                         They'd frame him.

                                     LISA
                              (horrified)
                         He's out of prison?

                                     MILO
                              (he nods)
                         They're already watching you. If 
                         they had to, they'd give him this 
                         drug that mimics an alcoholic 
                         blackout. He'd wake up not even 
                         remembering his "act of revenge."

               She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She 
               weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing 
               her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses, 
               tries to back away.

                                     LISA
                         No.

               But he holds on.

                                     MILO
                         Nobody's gonna hurt you.

               Slowly, he wraps his arms around her.

               She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her 
               face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell. 
               After a moment:

                                     LISA
                         ...Milo?

                                     MILO
                         Hmm?

                                     LISA
                         I always felt if a -- boy I liked 
                         ever found out -- he'd run. He'd 
                         think I was unclean.

                                     MILO
                         No, no. Never.

               She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust 
               breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame.

               A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm.

                                     VOICE (PHIL)
                         All his suspicions were allayed?

               INT. LIBRARY-LIKE OFFICE - DAY

               Alice nods. She sits in front of leather-bound books.

                                     VOICE
                         You're sure.

               She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch 
               her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a 
               remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake.

                                     ALICE
                         He said it made sense that Gary's 
                         code was like Teddy's, that that 
                         cliché about great minds was true. 
                         Said it was all about his own guilt.
                              (she shrugs)
                         Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary 
                         mixed-up with his dad once in a while. 
                         It always passes.

                                     PHIL
                         He wasn't acting?

                                     ALICE
                         I don't think he knows how.

               Phil looks convinced. Gary doesn't.

               EXT. HIGHWAY/GAS STATION - MORNING

               From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz 
               by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up 
               in the next lane. Ostensibly, they have run into each other 
               on the way to work. They are smiling, casual.

               Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear 
               no connection to their words.

                                     LISA
                         What about the FBI?

                         They've got this guy in the DOJ, 
                         maybe others. We tell the wrong 
                         person, it's over.

                         There's always a logical answer -- 
                         you just have to define the question.

               She defines it:

                                     LISA
                         How do you let go of a secret without 
                         telling the wrong person.

               She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless 
               female." He comes over to help her.

                                     MILO
                         We don't tell anybody.
                              (she's puzzled)
                         We tell everybody. At once. So there's 
                         no secret left to protect. When 
                         everybody knows, they don't dare 
                         touch us.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING

               Bob Shrot is on the phone. Behind him, a nerdy security 
               programmer, LEN DIETZ, is at the console that controls the 
               security cameras (the ones Milo futzed with).

                         not at your authorization level.

               Scrolling, Len knits his brow: he's found something odd.

                                     LEN
                         Bob? You better look at this.

               EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

               Milo checks Lisa's oil for her.

                         Do we post it on the Net?

                                     LISA
                         There're so many disinformation sites 
                         about Gary already. Where he has 
                         devil's horns or they crop him in

                         there may have been a break-in?

                         The mainstream media. TV, or a 
                         newsmagazine.

                         Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot 
                         of media conglomerates. Have to be 
                         careful who we pick.

                         We could cross-reference a data base 
                         on media ownership. But not on our 
                         own computers. Not even at home.

                                     MILO
                         Certainly not at my happy home.

               He slams the hood.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Shrot and Len watch a laser printer, as it spits out line 
               after line after line of swipe card entries...

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Milo watches new Skywire code emerge from his printer.

               Gary is in the doorway behind him: watching Milo, scrutin- 
               izing him. Sensing someone, Milo turns and looks.

                                     MILO
                         Gary, hi.

                                     GARY
                         You look a little tired.

                                     MILO
                         I'm okay. It's going well!

                                     GARY
                         'Have a look?

                                     MILO
                         Sure.

               Gary takes the page. As he reads it over:

                                     GARY
                         Why did you move around so much? 
                         When you were a kid.

                                     MILO
                         ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. 
                         Only he didn't think he was. That 
                         applied to guys who didn't have a 
                         "system." "Losers," who played games 
                         of chance. He could "read" people, 
                         so chance had nothing to do with it. 
                         No matter how deep a hole he dug 
                         himself, he'd give you the whole 
                         speech. And you'd better not point 
                         out the obvious.
                              (he shrugs)
                         His creditors would catch up to him. 
                         Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake 
                         us in the middle of the night. Off 
                         we'd go, again.

                                     GARY
                         What would you tell the kids? At 
                         your new school? You had to come up 
                         with a good story, right?

               Milo thinks: he's testing me.

                                     MILO
                         No. I just went deeper into the 
                         machine. Preferred being the geek to 
                         having to explain. Lying would've 
                         been worse.

                                     GARY
                         ...Worse?

                                     MILO
                         Cause he was a liar. And I hated 
                         him.
                              (mimicking a voice)
                         "Get your head out of that machine, 
                         wise up to the real world." The more 
                         he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause 
                         if being savvy meant being like him --
                              (he shrugs)
                         Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, 
                         even now. Didn't cultivate my 
                         conniving side. 'Not sure I even 
                         have one.

                                     GARY
                         Don't be so hard on yourself. With a 
                         brain like yours, you could connive 
                         with the best of 'em I bet.

               Gary smiles. There's no way to read it.

               EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Establish the humble building, in a Park.

               INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Lisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor. A Kid does 
               his homework on a computer at the next table. Milo shakes 
               his head, as he scrolls.

                                     MILO
                         He's buying up pretty much everything: 
                         cable companies, baby bells, picture 
                         libraries, museum rights, film 
                         archives... Getting ready for Skywire.

                                     LISA
                              (she's thinking)
                         What about "60 Minutes."

                                     MILO
                         Yeah, they dig stuff like this.
                              (he types, then reads)
                         "CBS News has partnered with Outpost 
                         Information Systems in a cable news 
                         network due to launch Fall of 2001."

                                     LISA
                         But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't 
                         love to break something like --

                                     MILO
                              (he's shaking his 
                              head)
                         Say there's just one "mole" working 
                         there, like Barton at the DOJ. How 
                         do we know he's not the guy we've 
                         contacted? Or she? Or the guy she 
                         works for?

               At the next table, she notices a Lady reading Time.

                                     LISA
                         Time?

                                     MILO
                              (types, reads)
                         Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake 
                         in Gary's set-top device. That also 
                         takes out CNN.
                              (scrolling & scrolling)
                         "GE joins Outpost in new venture," 
                         which means NBC is out. "Disney joins 
                         Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and 
                         Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. 
                         Any of these places could have a 
                         mole. Or all of 'em.
                              (still scrolling)
                         It's like a a continuous loop. We 
                         can go to some alternative press 
                         place that 1,000 people read, get 
                         them and us killed. But anything big 
                         enough for this is a parent of or a 
                         subsidiary to something Gary's got a 
                         finger in!

                                     HOMEWORK KID
                         Shhh.

                                     MILO
                         Sorry.

                         Milo?

               She's thought of something. He's watching the nerdy Kid, 
               smiling sadly, perhaps identifying with him.

                                     LISA
                         How close are you?

                                     MILO
                         What?

                                     LISA
                         He's got 12 satellites up. He's got 
                         dishes on top of 21. He's building 
                         this --
                              (gestures at the screen)
                         mega-network for Skywire. Let's use 
                         it.

               Move in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of 
               excitement and skepticism.

               EXT. LIBRARY/PARK - NIGHT

               Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking 
               it through.

                                     MILO
                         We can't just assume they're standing 
                         by to receive Skywire 12 months from 
                         launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.

                                     LISA
                         A what?

                                     MILO
                         It's how on-line services push logos 
                         they wanna sell you. You don't ask 
                         for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to 
                         work on it somewhere besides my office 
                         or my house. And then the quality of 
                         the broadcast wouldn't exactly be 
                         digital, that's 12 months away.

                                     LISA
                         But they'd still get the idea, right?

                                     MILO
                         You'd have to design a graphic 
                         interface to make the data pop. Maybe 
                         some audio, too. To tie it all in to 
                         Gary. How long would that take you?

                                     LISA
                         It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a 
                         concept, it's maybe three day's work.

                                     MILO
                         Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We 
                         have to do this fast.

                                     LISA
                         Before they kill somebody else, too.

                                     MILO
                              (a new wrinkle)
                         Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's 
                         house. To get the satellite positions.

                                     LISA
                         You mean -- break in?

                                     MILO
                         I don't know --

                                     LISA
                         And what if the broadcast dishes on 
                         top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said 
                         the place isn't finished.

               The complications pile up. They walk. They think.

                                     LISA
                         I'll go look.
                              (when he looks dubious)
                         They'll just have a few more pictures 
                         of me snooping around.

               They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the 
               park, stop walking.

                                     MILO
                              (looks at her)
                         Why were you so careless?

                                     LISA
                         I thought the worst they would do is 
                         fire me. Who knew they took 
                         termination so literally?

               Gallows humor. What a game girl. He's nuts about her.

                                     MILO
                         Why were you snooping in my office?

                                     LISA
                         Oh.
                              (she gets bashful)
                         I liked you. I was checking you out.

               He kisses her. There are no constraints now, there's no 
               "adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Slow push-in on the phone on Milo's desk: it's ringing.

               Alice is calling him. Her face hardens, she hangs up.

               Milo grins. He & Lisa lie in bed.

                         I told Teddy about you.

                         What'd he say?

                         "A beautiful geek? What're the 
                         chances?"

               She smiles, rather bashfully.

                                     MILO
                         I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so 
                         much" to Alice. But even then I was 
                         starting to wonder. Is it so great 
                         to be so consumed by this one thing 
                         that you let another person do your 
                         thinking for you? If you have a 
                         lucrative skill, it's all anybody 
                         wants from you. You grow older but 
                         you don't grow up. You turn into -- 
                         into --

                         Gary.

               It's painful for him: losing a second father.

                         Larry used to say how the guys who 
                         wrote the first cool operating 
                         systems, like the UNIX guys at 
                         Berkeley? They just gave it away. 
                         They figured it was human knowledge, 
                         it belonged to the world, like 
                         Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what 
                         I'm gonna do after we broadcast the

               Alice is in bed. In the darkness, Milo comes in as quietly 
               as possible. But she switches on the bedside lamp.

                                     ALICE
                         Where were you?
                              (holding his gaze)
                         You know you can't keep anything 
                         from me.

                                     MILO
                         Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... 
                         There's this amazing Comix store in 
                         Seattle.
                              (is she buying it?)
                         To tell you the truth, I did it once 
                         or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't 
                         keep anything from you...

               Of course she buys it: it's in the file.

                              (she smiles)
                         I won't turn you in.

               Shrot and Len go over the print-out of the card entries.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Morning TV is on in the kitchen. A Seattle station airs a 
               puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in formal 
               clothes (including Gary & his Wife) hold drinks and eat 
               canapés on the terrace over Lake Washington. (Gary's haircut 
               is different: it's file footage.)

                                     TV VOICE
                         Last years' party-goers pledged over 
                         $2 million to the Museum; this year's 
                         event promises to raise even more. 
                         Lured in part by the chance to see 
                         the stunning Boyd house...

               Alice, grinding coffee, isn't paying attention. Milo is.

                                     MILO
                         Look at this.

                                     ALICE
                         What?

                                     MILO
                         Why doesn't he ask us to his party. 
                         He's never even met you.

                                     ALICE
                         He has thousands of employees, Milo --

                         It's for the Museum. He knows you're 
                         a painter. If anybody should be 
                         invited --

                         I know you think I'm too attached to 
                         him, but still. I am close to Gary. 
                         And you're the most meaningful person 
                         in my life.
                              (he gets up)
                         I'm going back to the Comix place, 
                         why should I be killing myself.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo, you --

               But he's out the door. She's not entirely displeased by such 
               a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her.

               EXT. BUILDING 21 - DAY

               Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish 
               to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box.

               Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in 
               broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and 
               two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable. 
               The needle on the meter dances.

                                     GUARD
                         Hey! Get down here!

               She was expecting to be busted. Still, she's scared.

               EXT. SAINT CATHERINE'S DAY SCHOOL - DAY

               A Catholic school on a wooded lane. Schoolgirls in uniform 
               play on the swings and hopscotch courts.

               INT. LIBRARY - SAINT CATHERINE'S

               Milo types madly on a four-year-old PC. It takes him a moment 
               to notice SISTER BEATRICE.

                                     MILO
                         This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed 
                         just before finals.

                                     SISTER BEATRICE
                         None of us knows how to use it. I'm 
                         thinking of taking a course.
                              (she wants to look)
                         May I?

                                     MILO
                         Sure.

               With her, we see the complex lines of code.

                                     SISTER BEATRICE
                         Forget it.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Lisa sits with Bob Shrot. She's unfolding a page of sketch 
               paper.

                                     LISA
                         I needed t'see it up close for a 
                         graphic. The outpost with a dish on 
                         top? I climbed up there to get it 
                         right.

               She hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish. He looks 
               at her, at the drawing, at her again. She's scared, but tries 
               to hide it.

                                     SHROT
                              (hands back the drawing)
                         Next time you ask.

               Relieved, she gets up. The meter tumbles to the floor, thud. 
               She goes white. But when she looks up, she sees

               Shrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving 
               a printout.

                                     LEN
                         'Might of found something.

               Lisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len. As she goes out, 
               she hears:

                                     LEN
                         Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. 
                         Without leaving the first time.

                                     SHROT
                         Let's get him in here.

               INT. SEATTLE MONORAIL CAR - NIGHT

               Milo looks up as his train comes into a station. Lisa enters 
               the car, carrying a stack of comix. He stands, they kiss, he 
               takes the comix.

                                     MILO
                         Great. I knocked off the aglet, as 
                         soon as I get a passable version of

                         Thank God.

                                     LISA
                         Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke 
                         into #21. I was in his office when 
                         he was reviewing the card readouts.

                                     MILO
                              (confused)
                         They know I broke in. Alice helped 
                         me.
                              (figuring it out)
                         Shrot's not one of them. He's 
                         blundering into this on his own.

                                     LISA
                         He doesn't know about the Day Care.

                         Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty 
                         part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't 
                         bother with it, it's accessed by a 
                         tunnel they boast about. You know 
                         the best place to hide a leaf?

                                     LISA
                         Yeah, that's old, in a tree.

                                     MILO
                         Oh.

                                     LISA
                         Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody 
                         entered the Day Care at four A.M.? 
                         And tells them about it?

               They look at each other: the consequences of this discovery 
               would be deadly.

               A busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Programmers, 
               including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room.

               Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation 
               instantly drops out.

                                     GARY
                         Milo?

               Milo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation.

                         Huh?

               Shrot hands Delbert the printout. Delbert looks at it: dense 
               with coded entries. He stares at it.

                                     DELBERT

               desktop, with recognizable logos, fonts, etc.

                                     LISA
                         One window'll be obits I downloaded, 
                         based on the scenarios you described. 
                         The other windows'll accommodate the 
                         surveillance stuff you told me about. 
                         The idea is, this works with anything, 
                         since we can't edit.

               He nods. [It's not necessary for us to understand what she's 
               saying, just so Milo does.] She holds up an audio copy of 
               Gary's book, The Next Highway.

                                     LISA
                         Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: 
                         they'll play against any of the images 
                         you described.

                                     MILO
                         Perfect.
                              (something preys on 
                              his mind)
                         How am I gonna get away from the 
                         party long enough to --

                                     LISA
                         You could always say you have to go 
                         the bathroom.

                                     MILO
                         That's lame, isn't it?

                                     LISA
                         You'll come up with something.

               He already looks nervous. We begin to hear live music.

               EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The music echoes from inside. Push past a line of cars and 
               limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of 
               it.

               Milo and Alice get out. As they go inside, she pulls a tag 
               from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

               As Milo and Alice enter, he sees a Balthus painting re-
               digitize to a Mondrian.

                                     ALICE
                         They called the house to ask who's 
                         your favorite painter.

               Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to 
               sneak away, now.

               They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep guests 
               from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass 
               through to get to Gary's workroom). A Guy in a pretentiously 
               hip tux tries to peek in.

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence 
                         is restricted.

               Milo looks a little more tense...

               PARTY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               The room is full of people. A long windowed wall has been 
               opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more Guests drink and 
               chat, and an orchestra plays.

               A giant Mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest 
               ID card. Milo sinks a little more.

               Across the room, Gary, his Wife (a blandly pretty blond) and 
               two Men are grouped around a Monet set on an antique easel 
               (thus clearly the real thing; Mrs. Boyd has prevailed.) Gary 
               notices the giant digital Mondrian.

               MILO takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray. He hands one 
               to Alice as Gary et. al. approach.

                                     GARY
                         Alice, I'm Gary. This is my wife, 
                         Clarissa.
                              (handshakes, etc.)
                         Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's 
                         visiting from Hollywood.

               LINDER is a short, tan man of 50.

                                     LINDER
                         I hate being the Hollywood guy. It's 
                         so limiting. Meet my friend, Ricky.

               RICKY is 25-years-old; he looks like a Polo model.

                                     RICKY
                         Hi, guys.

                                     GARY
                         Barry's studio's gonna help fill the 
                         Skywire pipeline, thought you guys 
                         should meet.

                                     MILO
                              (his mind elsewhere)
                         Cool.

               ANGLE: the orchestra, playing.

               ANGLE: a group of SOCIETY TYPES chatting.

                                     SOCIETY WOMAN
                         He's a sweetheart. He gave 10,000 
                         PC's to the Library Association.

                                     SOCIETY MAN
                         All 10,000 of which will be signed 
                         onto his browser, no doubt.

                                     SOCIETY WOMAN
                         And so what?!

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         Wait'll all the books are on-line.

                                     SOCIETY WOMAN
                         And so what?

               ANGLE: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky. 
               Milo looks utterly preoccupied...

                                     LINDER
                         The merchandising implications are 
                         epic. A kid's watching the movie, he 
                         points and clicks at the laser blaster -- 
                         before the reel's even over he's 
                         ordered the toy.

                                     ALICE
                         But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate -- 
                         won't that influence the content? 
                         Won't the artists complain? The 
                         directors or writers or whoever?

                                     LINDER
                         Artists? Darling, the only art left 
                         in America is business. You're in 
                         Picasso's house!

               Gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn't 
               heard any of it.

                                     MILO
                         Where's the bathroom?

                                     LINDER
                         The irreverence!

               Laughter.

               TRACK MILO as he wends his way through laughing, chatting 
               Guests, dread and determination on his face. He moves away 
               from us, enters the

               ENTRANCE HALL

               speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms.

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         You'll have to use one over there.

               He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door.

                                     MILO
                         There's like eight women waiting in 
                         line. They take forever.
                              (winces: painful 
                              bladder)
                         Please?

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Right here.

               He points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman 
               watches, Milo goes into the

               BATHROOM

               He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open 
               the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo 
               makes his move.

               DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far 
               end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably 
               appears.

               The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom 
               door, assumes Milo's still inside.

               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital 
               art, now a Bosch again.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS

               Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees 
               a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, 
               tastefully decorated rooms are blending together.

               He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. 
               Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly-
               appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich, 
               professionally-decorated taste.

               He's lost.

               He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.

               INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

               The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the 
               Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian.

               He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He 
               pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket.

               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts 
               toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he 
               sees:

               A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses 
               in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS

               A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees 
               Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a 
               direction, keeps moving.

               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he 
               slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music 
               echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled 
               with a Mondrian.

               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, 
               whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He 
               and Alice share a look as he moves off.

               We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through 
               Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he 
               hardly hears them.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT

               Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC 
               screen:

               LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East

               LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South

               ALTITUDE - 426 MILES

               He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next 
               satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up.

               Nobody's there.

               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS

               The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by 
               the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs 
               into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different 
               Mondrian, in a different room.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS

               Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He 
               moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.

               GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo still working...

               PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her 
               face sets grimly.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't 
               see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains 
               away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych.

               After a moment, Milo senses something.

               Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't 
               breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's.

               Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled 
               with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.

                                     GARY
                              (reading the screen)
                         "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working 
                         with you. I'd be lying if I didn't 
                         say I find you attractive. But in my 
                         heart I know that Alice..."
                              (he looks up)
                         You left my party to send E-mail?

                                     MILO
                         I couldn't do it at work cause of 
                         security or at home for -- obvious 
                         reasons.

               Gary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music 
               floats in from afar as the moment stretches.

                                     GARY
                         You could've handwritten it.

                                     MILO
                         I'm not much good at handwriting. Or 
                         parties.

                                     GARY
                         Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."

               This hangs there.

                                     MILO
                         Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude --

               The Second Houseman sticks his head in.

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Everything OK, Mr. Boyd?

                                     GARY
                         No problem.
                              (when he's gone)
                         Is there?

                                     MILO
                         Gary, I --

                                     GARY
                         You see what's hanging on the wall?

               He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed 
               commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood 
               program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed.

               Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.

                                     GARY
                         I hope you know what you mean to me. 
                         Not just because of what you're doing. 
                         Because of who you are.

                                     MILO
                         I do know, Gary. I feel the same 
                         way. I thought I was coming here for 
                         a job. But it's meant a lot more.

               Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys 
               it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured 
               by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses.

               Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the 
               art books, vaguely looks through one.

                                     GARY
                         When will you have a Beta version?

               Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.

                                     MILO
                         I'm pretty close. But when I wrote 
                         the last contact switches, it wiped 
                         out a piece of the content filer. 
                         You know what it's like, writing 
                         software.

                                     GARY
                         I do know. You focus on the big 
                         problem. But somewhere down the chain, 
                         something breaks down. Something 
                         gets destroyed. At first it's 
                         upsetting. You feel you've lost 
                         control.

               Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo.

                                     GARY
                         So you have to remind yourself: it's 
                         just the process. Something's always 
                         lost along the way to anything 
                         worthwhile. Some little bug, some 
                         glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in 
                         that, you're doing something other 
                         people could never do. They lack the 
                         imagination, the brain, the nerve. 
                         Let them fret about every unforeseen 
                         consequence. You have to solve the 
                         problem. That's who you are.

               Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a 
               pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?

               EXT./INT DRIVEWAY/MILO'S CAR - LATER

               In the car, Milo and Alice pull away from the lights and 
               limos in icy silence. Several beats.

                                     ALICE
                         Are you gonna tell me where you went?

                                     MILO
                         I went to see the Skywire model in 
                         Gary's office. You know. Just to 
                         hold it again.

               He looks at her. She stares ahead, out the windshield.

                                     ALICE
                         Are you having an affair, Milo?

               He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice.

                                     MILO
                         No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, 
                         just now. To tell her how I feel 
                         about you.
                              (looks at her)
                         You know I'm clueless, without you. 
                         You know I --

                                     ALICE
                              (fighting tears)
                         Just shut up?

               Or is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them? 
               He's afraid, now.

               EXT. INT. DAY CARE - DAY

               Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard.

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

               We hear the children's shouts OS. Short, with a fingerprint 
               kit, is dusting the keyboards. Len stands over him.

                                     LEN
                         Get the backslash, the colon, keys 
                         kids don't use but geeks do.
                              (looking around, 
                              perplexed)
                         What would Milo want in here, anyway?

                                     SHROT
                         They know. 'Just they don't trust me 
                         with it. So we'll get the evidence, 
                         first, ask questions later.

               EXT. LIBRARY PARK - EVENING

               By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa.

                                     LISA
                         Does he know you know?

                                     MILO
                         He suspects I know something. I think 
                         he was sort of -- explaining himself 
                         to me, in case I do.
                              (he breathes)
                         We have to go in tonight. I'm two 
                         hours from a Beta version.
                              (knows she won't like 
                              it)
                         But I've gotta go home for an hour.

                                     LISA
                         Why?!

                                     MILO
                         She called to apologize. I said I 
                         was pulling an all-nighter. She said 
                         then come home just to say Hi. Which 
                         I always do when we fight, it's 
                         suspicious if I don't.

                                     LISA
                         Please don't go.

                                     MILO
                         At this point the worst thing I could 
                         do is anything out of the ordinary.

               She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her 
               backpack.

                                     LISA
                         Here's the interface.

               He takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried.

               EXT./INT. MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.

               He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen 
               in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her 
               hair is askew.

                                     ALICE
                         I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook, 
                         since we're always afraid for you to 
                         eat in Chinese restaurants. I've 
                         been mincing things into teeny-tiny 
                         pieces all afternoon.

               He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or 
               just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture?

                                     MILO
                         Great!

                                     ALICE
                         Look at me! I'm gonna change.

               When she turns away, we see the fear on his face.

               INT. THE BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Alice pulls into a dress.

               IN THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a 
               wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too 
               fine to discern one ingredient from another.

               BEDROOM

               Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon...

               KITCHEN

               Milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label 
               on a jar, the label on a can...

               BEDROOM

               Alice applies blush-on.

               KITCHEN

               Milo goes through the spice cabinet...

               LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom.

                                     MILO
                              (he smiles)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.

                                     MILO
                         ...What?

                                     ALICE
                         I know you. You're gonna run back to 
                         work right after dinner. I want my 
                         kiss now.

               Either she's the most cold-blooded woman in the world, or...

               He takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard -- as if 
               his life depended on it. When he releases her, she pretends 
               to swoon. She backs toward the kitchen.

                                     ALICE
                         Be right back.

               KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

               Camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big 
               bowl as Alice spoons the food into it... She sprinkles on 
               some final ingredient, also minced.

               DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo's fingers drum the table top...

               KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Alice picks up the dish. We don't see her face.

               ON THE DISH - MOVING - CONTINUOUS (ALICE'S POV)

               We hold the dish out in front of us. The food shines in the 
               light, a poisonous yellow gleam. We move from kitchen to 
               dining room, slowly, deliberately...

               Milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile. 
               We come all the way to the table with the dish, where Alice 
               sets it down.

               She sits. Milo, still vamping, pours wine. He picks up his 
               fork. Stares at it.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo?

               His mind churns furiously.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         Don't we have any chopsticks?

                                     ALICE
                         Oh, right. Hold on.

               When she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the 
               tines of his fork against it, making score-marks, like those 
               used by allergists to test for sensitivity.

               He dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean. He stares 
               at it.

               INT. KITCHEN DRAWER - CONTINUOUS

               Alice roots through ladles, bottle openers, cheese graters, 
               spatulas. At the bottom of the drawer, she finds two pairs 
               of take-out chopsticks, wrapped in white paper.

               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo looks from his watch to his arm -- no reaction yet.

                                     MILO
                              (under his breath)
                         One more minute...

               But here's Alice. She slips into her seat.

                                     ALICE
                         Here we go.

                                     MILO
                         Great.

               He unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly.

                                     MILO
                         ...wanna savor this.

                                     ALICE
                         It's gonna get cold.

                                     MILO
                         Right. Wait. A toast.

                                     ALICE
                         You're just afraid to eat it.

               She smiles, picks up her glass.

                                     MILO
                         To the artist.

               They toast. She sips her wine. He sips his. He wants 
               desperately to glance at his inner arm once more. But she's 
               watching him, waiting for him to eat.

               He picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite. She 
               watches keenly. He brings the food to his mouth, passes it 
               between his lips, swallows.

               He closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact 
               bracing for a paroxysm.

               She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict on the 
               food, or for the first fatal spasm.

                                     MILO
                              (his voice cracks)
                         It's great. It's great.

               She grins. She takes a bite. The moment she looks away, he 
               turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear.

               The tracks are still flat, there's no redness. He shovels a 
               large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive. Then another 
               bite, greedy with life.

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT

               Shrot and Len are in a high-tech office. On a monitor, we 
               see a blown-up image of a fingerprint taken from Milo's 
               keyboard; Milo's name is printed under it.

               In a second window, other fingerprints flash by: thousands 
               of prints lifted off keyboards in the Day Care.

               Shrot waits for a match to click in.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Milo scrolls his Skywire code, concentrating intensely. Till 
               he feels some stickiness on his thumb and forefinger. He 
               rubs them together, peers at his keys.

               Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder.

               Fear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a 
               bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it 
               in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case.

               INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

               Milo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bumps 
               into Gary's Secretary.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Milo, hi! How was the party?

                                     MILO
                         Great! Great! Thanks for asking!

               He continues up the hall. He ducks into the service hall.

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot watches as

               The computer produces an alarm-like buzzing. The second window 
               locks onto the matching print. The prints flash in unison, 
               garishly confirming the match.

               INT. TUNNEL/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

               Milo races along the tunnel that leads from #20 to the Day 
               Care...

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot punches a number on the phone.

                                     LEN
                         You calling Phil and Randy?

                                     SHROT
                         I'm calling Gary.

               INT. STAIRWELL/DAY CARE BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo climbs the stairs, fumbles with the swipecard, enters 
               the Day Care.

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Len is at the console. On a security monitor, he has called-
               up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost 
               running into Gary's Secretary.

               Shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone.

                                     SHROT
                         He's left his office, we think he's 
                         gone back to the Day Care for some 
                         reason. Can you tell me why, Gary?
                              (he listens)
                         Whatever you say.
                              (hangs up angrily)
                         Wants to consult with Phil. Was it 
                         Phil's idea to run the fingerprints?

               Shrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out.

                                     SHROT
                         Come with me.

                                     LEN
                              (trying to catch up)
                         Where we going?

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo is under the table, detaching one of the the black 
               plastic data towers that contain the "primers," stored 
               surveillance material, etc.

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Phil hangs up the phone. He turns to Randy, who is with the 
               two men: the blond GUNTHER, the pale-eyed RIMAN.

                                     PHIL
                         He's in the Day Care.

               INT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo carefully detaches a second data tower.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care 
               across the quad. Len is ill-at-ease:

                                     LEN
                         Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop.

               In his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him.

               INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Gunther, Riman & Randy head down the service hallway, en 
               route to the bomb shelter stairs.

               INT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm 
               (wondering if he should just ditch one) gets as far as the 
               main, colorfully-carpeted room --

               Shrot is there, gun drawn. Len stands just behind.

                                     SHROT
                         What are you doing?

                                     MILO
                         You're better off not knowing.

               Shrot thinks he's being mocked, as usual.

                                     SHROT
                         What're you doing?!

               Milo sets down one of the towers.

                                     MILO
                         They're surveilling programmers from 
                         in here. They steal their code. 
                         Sometimes -- I know this sounds insane -- 
                         sometimes they kill one.

               Shrot looks skeptical.

                                     MILO
                         They let me break into 21. 'Cause 
                         there's nothing in there. You know 
                         they've been keeping things from 
                         you. 'Getting in the way when you 
                         try t'do your job. That's why you 
                         never told 'em your suspicions about 
                         me. Right?

               Shrot doesn't deny it.

                                     MILO
                         If you had I'd be dead now.

               Milo's sincerity is striking. Shrot cogitates.

                                     MILO
                         You've been following your gut all 
                         along. Please don't stop now?

               INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

               Gunther, Riman and Randy climb the metal stairs, turn at a 
               landing, climb some more.

               When they get to the next landing, Riman opens the door. 
               They enter

               THE DAY CARE - BACK ROOM

               Hearing voices inside, Gunther draws a gun; they move forward 
               stealthfully. They enter the

                                     RANDY

               Randy sees: Shrot and Len.

                                     SHROT
                         Who're these guys?

                         Where is he?

                                     SHROT
                         We're too late. Take a look.

               He shines his light under the table, where the towers have 
               been detached.

                                     SHROT
                         What's in here worth taking, anyway?

               EXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS

               Milo hurries away from the Day Care. He has just one data 
               tower, now, so he can move faster.

               INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Randy starts to push past Shrot --

                                     RANDY
                         He must be out there still --

               He gets to the front room, where the jettisoned data tower 
               still sits (but he doesn't see it).

                                     SHROT
                              (calling after)
                         Forget about it. His car's not in 
                         the lot, he's gone!

               Shrot watches anxiously to see if he's stopped Randy.

               EXT. OUTPOST - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Milo moves low among the high-priced cars, lugging the tower. 
               He gets to his Deux Chevaux, opens the trunk --

                                     VOICE
                         Hey!

               Milo turns. It's Desi, again.

                                     DESI
                         Wanna get a cheeseburger or something?

                         Maybe another time.

               As calmly as possible, he stows the tower, slams the trunk, 
               gets in the car.

               Randy hangs up the phone.

                         Wait a second. I'm the one who found 
                         out he was mucking around in here in 
                         the first place.

                         We're all grateful for that. Really. 
                         Go out the way you came in?

               When he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite 
               dish through the windshield.

               As the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a

               the shirt. But Gunther's concerned by Milo's behavior:

                                     GUNTHER
                              (staring at Milo)
                         Wait.

               As Milo watches the screens, a pixilated, ghostly image begins 
               to appear on all of them: the animated Skywire logo (lightning 
               strike, etc.).

               Brian lurches across to the laptop, ejects the CD-ROM. It's 
               beige-colored, says Outpost Word.

                         You should've called a few times to

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Gary and Phil watch as the Skywire logo gets steadily stronger 
               on Gary's TV's. Phil is confounded:

                                     PHIL
                         If Milo didn't launch Skywire, who 
                         did?

               We hear a low steady hum.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               have a plate on it. Panning along the cable, we widen to 
               show:

               INT. UNFINISHED STUDIO (#21) - CONTINUOUS

               In dim construction light, not far from the Sears generator, 
               Len sits on the concrete floor. The second data tower is 
               patched into a laptop. The distinct silver jewelcase lies by 
               the CD-rom drive. Shrot paces:

                                     SHROT
                         Now what are we doing? I don't get

                         I launched Skywire. Just pray the 
                         last set of coordinates Milo sent me 
                         connected us to Gary's satellite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FOUR TV SETS

               Each shows the standard Outpost desktop: Outpost logo, fonts, 
               colors. [This is the all-purpose interface Lisa created for 
               to Milo.] A window at the top shows a succession of Obituaries 
               with photos Lisa has downloaded from newspapers: "Programmer 
               Dies in Highway Crash;" "Programmer Among Cult Suicides;" 
               "Programmer Victim of Racial Killing," etc.) The obituaries -- 
               eight of them -- fade up and down in a continuous cycle. 
               Meantime:

               Lower on the screen, the material from the day-care data 
               tower appears, following the same succession we saw when 
               Milo brought up Teddy's data, i.e., footage of a young 
               Programmer at college, surveillance footage of him typing 
               away (from behind), medical records that describe his 
               vulnerability or a crime primer that describes his scenario. 
               Between the obits and the primers, cause and effect is 
               (eventually) established.

               The crowning note is the audio, Gary in VOICE OVER, gleaned 
               (by Lisa) from the audio version of his own book:

                                     GARY'S VOICE OVER
                         Most of us who write software achieve 
                         our greatest work before age 30. As 
                         I grow older I know how important it 
                         is to access fertile young minds!

               Gary watching.

               INT. KNQR - SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               We hear sirens grow near. Gunther watches the broadcast, 
               still gripping his gun.

                         You know the scenario for this.

               This sounds ominous. Lisa wonders what it means. Milo wonders 
               what it means. He swallows hard.

               1. MOVE PAST ROWS & ROWS OF PC's playing surveillance footage, 
               a crash-scene upload, and an obituary, in a college computer 
               lab. Students watch, agog.

                                     GARY'S VOICE OVER
                         We work hard to stay ahead because 
                         we know any kid working in his garage 
                         can put us out of business.

               2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned 
               necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop. 
               In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in 
               the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the 
               Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, 
               sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear).

                                     GARY'S VOICE OVER
                         The first rule of the software 
                         business is: those who don't innovate 
                         are doomed to die.

               3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians 
               flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. 
               At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over 
               the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks 
               as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a 
               STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a 
               STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision 
               behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, 
               a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage 
               for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost 
               '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day 
               Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy 
               moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic 
               hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data.

               Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration:

                                     GARY'S VOICE OVER
                         That's why we work so hard to invent 
                         or acquire great new applications. 
                         Consumers don't care where new ideas 
                         come from, just so long as they're 
                         offered at competitive prices. Isn't 
                         that what the free market's about? 
                         Sure, we like being #1, but it's 
                         pressure, too. This business is 
                         binary: you're a zero or a one.

                                     GARY
                         "I had no knowledge of these 
                         activities, but I have to ask myself 
                         if the competitive environment I 
                         encouraged in some small way 
                         contributed --"

                                     LAWYER
                         Gary?

               Gary looks up. The Lawyer nods soberly at the TV's.

               In one window, the Skywire code scrolls slowly past. In the 
               other, it says: "Here's the code for the operating system 
               that made this braodcast possible. Take it. Use it. Make the 
               new convergence technologies as free as the Web."

               Under the windows, these words scroll continuously: HUMAN 
               KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE WORLD.

               Watching, Gary knits his brow: he looks wounded.

               INT. COLLEGE COMPUTER LAB - CONTINUOUS

               In the lab that began the montage, move past rows of Students 
               scribbling madly as the code unfolds, or saving it to their 
               hard drives.

               Off-screen, a Student says, "Well, the genie's out of that 
               bottle."

                                                                SHORT FADE:

                                     CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)
                         Outpost was his baby, sure. On the

                         Personally.

               INT. SUNNYVALE LOFT - DAY

               Larry Lindholm sits on a couch watching TV. MOVERS are 
               carrying out computer equipment all around him. He tries to 
               ignore them.

                                     CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)
                         Conglomerates're lined up to finance 
                         the launch of the remaining 
                         satellites. They'll pay him a huge 
                         premium to get on-line.

                                     LARRY KING
                         That'd change with a criminal 
                         indictment.

                                     CYBER PUNDIT
                         There's no hard evidence he knew 
                         about this. Anybody who could 
                         implicate him seems to've vanished.

                                     LARRY KING (ON TV)
                         Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling 
                         this guy?

                                     CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)
                         Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you 
                         some slack in this world.

                                     LARRY KING (ON TV)
                         And the kid who wrote Skywire -- 
                         then gave it away? They're calling 
                         him the digital Robin Hood.

                                     CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)
                         Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.

                                     LARRY KING (ON TV)
                         We tried!

                                     CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)
                         You better believe everybody's trying 
                         to sign him up.

               As Larry (King) chuckles, Larry (Lindholm) looks up.

               Milo and Lisa wear backpacks. As Milo sluffs his off:

                                     MILO
                         Larry, Lisa.

               Larry switches off the TV as he comes to his feet. A Mover 
               passes by, hauling out a monitor. Larry explains:

                                     LARRY
                         Your app kind of blew mine out of 
                         the water.

                                     MILO
                              (he shrugs)
                         We'll come up with the next big thing.

                                     LARRY
                         ...You wanna work -- here?

                                     MILO
                         Got out of my other commitment.

               Larry hugs Milo. Turns to Lisa:

                                     LARRY
                         May I?

               He hugs Lisa, too. A Mover grabs Milo's backpack from the 
               floor.

                                     MILO
                         Hey, wait!
                              (when the Mover looks)
                         Not giving everything away.

               The Mover sets it down, moves on.

                                     LARRY
                         C'mon. Bring your stuff.

               Milo grabs up his pack, the three of them head away from 
               camera.

                                     LARRY
                         You guys'll be using Teddy's old 
                         space, is that okay?

                                     MILO
                         Cool.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

   them about witches and witchcraft (a caldron over a fire, with two
   witches on either side of it - A close-up of one of the witches -

   BROOKLYN - GENERAL OVERVIEW - EXTERIOR DAY

   A general overview of Brooklyn, near New York, seen from the roof
   of a very high building. Written in white letters on this
   overview, the following words :

                         This is a Hallowe'en
                       tale of Brooklyn, where
                        anything can happen--
                         and it usually does.

   Then :
                           At 3 P.M. on this
                         particular day, this
                             was happening-

   covered by a huge base ball, with «Brooklyn» written on it in
   black letters.

   BASEBALL GAME - SPECTATORS - EXTERIOR DAY

   Close-up of the face of man, screaming :

          BASEBALL FAN
          I'll knock your block off, you big stiff ! You're a bum !

   The camera moves away, so we can see the other baseball spectators
   behind the first one.

   BASEBALL FIELD - EXTERIOR DAY

   Then a very excited brass band playing. Then a few very excited
   spectators. Then another player throwing a ball.

   Finally we see a batter missing his ball. We hear the Umpire,
   standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection
   suit, yelling :

       THE UMPIRE
       Strike ! You're out !

   The batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and
   comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask
   away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on
   the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises
   slowly from the ground.

   Several very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove
   and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to
   join the fight. Several player, who were waiting for their turn to
   go on the field, also run to the fight. Then a view of the fight,

   seller, dropping his basket to join the fight. Then spectators
   jumping over the balustrades to join the fight. Then another view

   on the field and leaning on one elbow, and quietly munching some
   food.

   NEW YORK - A BRIDGE - EXTERIOR DAY

   We see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing
   underneath. Written in large white letters on the screen, the
   words :

                      While at the same time
                     across the river in the
                        UNITED STATE PROPER
                      there was a romance in
                              the air.

MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up on the sign «MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU», with people
passing underneath.

       AN EXCITED GIRL VOICE
       Elmer, here it is.

       A MORE QUIET MALE VOICE
       I knew you'd find it.

       ANOTHER MALE VOICE
       Boy, I could sure use a drink.

The camera gets down from the sign to floor level. Two journalists
are approaching, one equipped with a camera.

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER
       I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ?
They stop at the door of the room.

Larger view of the room, where several people are, either standing
in a queue, either sitting at a table and filling forms, either
chatting in groups of two or three

Back to the two journalists still standing a the door.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       Looks like the same suckers get married every day.

He looks around for a few second, then starts to move away.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       Come on.

The photographer makes him come back. He points to someone in the
room.

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER
       Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

In a line of people queueing in front of a counter, we see
Mortimer Brewster, with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses. He
turns around and notices the two journalists looking at him. He
raises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face. The
girl in front of him turns around to look at him. She has blonde
curly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather. She is
Elaine Harper. With both his hands, Mortimer turns her face back
toward the counter.

Back to the two journalists at the door of the room.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       Now what's he hiding from ?

He starts moving to get a better look at Mortimer.
Mortimer moves in front of Elaine, who smiles.

The two journalists are now in the room, and they look at
Mortimer.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER
       Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ?

Mortimer looks very embarrassed.

Back to the two journalists.


       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       No, it's not him. But what a scoop it would be ! The guy
       who wrote The Bachelor's Bible finally getting hooked
       himself. Nope. It's too good to be true. Come on, let's
       snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home.
       THE PHOTOGRAPHER
       Hey, let's stick around, and see who the guy is.

Back to the line of people waiting in front of the counter. The
marriage clerk is standing behind a set of metal bars. A couple of
people leaves the counter. It's now Mortimer and Elaine's turn.
The marriage clerk sings :

       THE CLERK
       "Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !"

He smiles to Mortimer and Elaine.

       THE CLERK
       Good morning, children. Your name, please ?

       ELAINE
       Elaine Harper.

She spoke in a very soft voice. The clerk put his hand around his
ear.
        THE CLERK
        Speak a little louder.

She speaks louder.

       ELAINE
       Elaine Harper.

       THE CLERK
       Thank you. Yours ?

Mortimer comes very close to the bars above the counter and
whispers.

       MORTIMER
       Mortimer Brewster.
The clerk puts his hand back around his ear.

The two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to
understand Mortimer's name

       THE CLERK
       How's that ?

Mortimer raises his glasses, but still whispers.

       MORTIMER
       Mortimer Brewster.

       THE CLERK
       Speak up, sonny. There's nothing to be afraid of.

Mortimer bends down, putting his chin at the counter level. Then
he stands up again, and opens the gate in front of the clerk. He
knocks his head on the bar above the gate. He straightens his hat,
and brings his face close to the clerk's one. He still whispers.
       MORTIMER
       I want to keep this undercover.

       THE CLERK
       Love her ? But of course you love her. You're going to
       marry her, aren't you ?

       MORTIMER
       No-no, you don't understand. Come here, come.

With his finger, he signals the clerk to come close to him.

       MORTIMER
       You see, I don't want this to get out for a while. I'm
       Mortimer Brewster.

       THE CLERK
       You're who ?

Mortimer stops controlling himself and starts yelling

       MORTIMER
       Mortimer Brew...

He doesn't finish telling his name, takes Elaine's hand, and runs
outside the room, dragging Elaine behind him.

The two journalists react to the news.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       That's him !

They start running after Mortimer.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

Still dragging Elaine, Mortimer runs in the corridor.
       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       (voice over)
       Mister Brewster !

Mortimer pushes Elaine into a telephone booth and enters behind
her. There is already a man in the booth who is using the phone.
With three people in the booth, Mortimer can hardly close the door
behind him.

The two journalists runs in the corridor.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST
       Oh, Mister Brewster !

But they pass the booth without noticing that Mortimer is inside.

In the booth, the man, still holding the phone receiver, tries to
protest the intrusion.

       THE MAN ON THE PHONE
       Now, look...
Mortimer takes the receiver from him and speaks into it.

       MORTIMER
       Goodbye, dear.

He hangs up the receiver, and then pushes violently the man
outside the booth. The man looks very angry, but doesn't try to
come back in the booth.

In the booth, a very exciter Mortimer is talking to Elaine.

       MORTIMER
       Don't you understand ? How can I marry you ? Me, the symbol
       of bachelorhood. I've sneered at every love scene in every
       play. I've written four million words against marriage !
       Not only hooked, but to a minister's daughter, and not only
       a minister's daughter but a girl from Brooklyn. And look at
       the way you look ! What is that sort of contraption you've
       got there ?

He taps on a pin on the lapel of Elaine's jacket.

       ELAINE
       That's a pin I borrowed from your aunts. You know what
       they're saying, "Something borrowed..."

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, I know that "Something borrowed, something blue."
       Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold.
       Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe I made fun for years.
       Is this what I've come to ? I can't go through with it. I
       won't marry you. And that's that.

He takes his glasses off. Elaine whispers :

       ELAINE
       Yes, Mortimer.
       MORTIMER
       What do you mean, «Yes, Mortimer» ? Aren't you insulted ?
       Aren't you going to cry ? Aren't you going to make a
       scene ?

       ELAINE
       No, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       And don't «No, Mortimer» me, either ! Don't you see
       marriage is a superstition. It's old-fashioned. It's...
       a... a... Ohh !...

He kisses her very passionately.

He stops kissing her, and gets out of the booth, dragging her
behind him. They enter the marriage bureau.

MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

They get back a the end of the line of people waiting to be
married.
The girl in front of Elaine winks to Elaine. Elaine winks back to
her.

A man in front of the girls turns toward Mortimer and smiles to
him, in a slightly idiotic way. Mortimer looks at him, a bit
surprised, and gives him a forced smile, showing his teeth.

BROOKLYN - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - EXTERIOR DAY

We see a street in Brooklyn, in front of nice house. Written on
the screen in large white letters :

                        And now, back to
                     one of Brooklyn's most
                      charming residential
                           districts--

BROOKLYN - CHURCHYARD - EXTERIOR DAY

A churchyard, with a close-up on a tombstone : «Jacob John
Vendemeer died 1654». Written on the screen in large white
letters :

                      --From her in you're
                           on your own.

We see the gate of the churchyard, with a plate that says : «This
cemetery was established in april 1654»

Along this gate, two cops are doing their beat. The older one,
Sargent Brophy, is talking to the younger one, Officer Patrick
O'Hara.

       BROPHY
       O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't seem to realize. I'm
       turning over to you the nicest, the best beat in Brooklyn.
       Now look at that old church. And them old houses.
       O'HARA
       Did George Washington ever do any sleeping around here ?

       BROPHY
       Of course he did. Well, this whole neighborhood just stinks
       with atmosphere. And look at that old house there.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Walking their beat, the two cops have come outside the Brewster
sisters residence.

       O'HARA
       Are the original owners still over there ?

       BROPHY
       Now, don't crack wise about the Brewster sisters. They're
       two of the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever
       walked the earth. They're out of this world. They're
       like... they're like pressed rose leaves.
They have come near a police call box. Brophy takes a key out of
his pocket to open the box

       O'HARA
       Pressed rose leaves ?

In front of the house, there is a «Room for Rent» sign. While
Brophy picks up the phone in the call box, O'Hara looks at the
sign.

       O'HARA
       The old girls must be kind of hard up, huh ?

       BROPHY
       No, no. Their old man left them fixed for life. And don't
       you call them «the girls», either.

Brophy starts talking in the receiver of the call box.

       BROPHY
       Brophy. Is Lieutenant around ?

       O'HARA
       Then, so why here do they rent a room for ?

       BROPHY
       They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came
       looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good
       meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets.
       That's just their way of digging up people to do good to.

We get a closer view of the front of the house. A large
rectangular stone, with «Brewster» engraved on it. A group of
children runs in front of the house.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

In the forefront of the room, Teddy Brewster is playing Mozart's
Turkish March on the harpsichord. He looks a bit like late
President Theodore Roosevelt. And he is dressed like the President
was dressed on the official pictures we've got of him... And, like
the President, he is wearing a pince-nez.

In another corner of the room, Abby Brewster is having tea with
Reverend Harper, Elaine's father. She looks like an old English
lady, a bit like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.

       ABBY
       Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer
       just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter
       to the theater every night.

       REVEREND HARPER
       It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic,
       but no man, no man with this published attitude on
       marriage...

Close-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table :
«Marriage, a Fraud and a Failure, by Mortimer Brewster».
       REVEREND HARPER
       ...should take any man's daughter anyplace...

He sneezes.

       REVEREND HARPER
       ...at any time.

He sneezes again, louder this time. Teddy stops playing and there
is a puzzled look in his eyes.

       TEDDY
       I must be catching cold.

       ABBY
       (to Teddy)
       No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed.
       (to Reverend Harper)
       Bless you.

Teddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out
and starts playing again.

       ABBY
       We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in
       love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about
       it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now,
       now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

The two cops, Brophy and O'Hara, are mounting the steps to the
Brewster sisters house.

       BROPHY
       Remember now, watch your language.

       O'HARA
       Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man.

       BROPHY
       You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing.

He rings the doorbell.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

At the sound of the doorbell, Teddy stops playing.

       ABBY
       Oh, will you excuse me ?

She gets up from her armchair.

       ABBY
       No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

She goes to the door and opens it.

       ABBY
       Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy.

The two cops get in.

       BROPHY
       Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

       ABBY
       Oh yes.

O'Hara closes the door.

       BROPHY
       This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat.

       O'HARA
       How are you doing ?

       ABBY
       May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara.

Teddy, with his teacup in hand, joins the group. He speaks with a
very serious expression on his face.

       TEDDY
       Gentlemen, what news have you brought me ?

Brophy salutes him and stands at attention.

       BROPHY
       Colonel, we have nothing to report.

Teddy gives an intrigued look to O'Hara, who doesn't seem to
understand. Brophy elbows him with the arm which is still
saluting.

       O'HARA
       Huh ?
He eventually understands what his Sargent is trying to tell him.

       O'HARA
       Oh no, absolutely nothing to report.

He salutes but with a less official attitude than his Sargent.
Teddy smiles.

       TEDDY
       Splendid ! Thank you, gentlemen.
       (very serious again)
       At ease.

Brophy puts his arm down. O'Hara looks at his Sargent with a
perplexed expression, and takes longer to put his arm down

       ABBY
       You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next
       door ?

       BROPHY
       Hello, Reverend. This is Officer O'Hara, the new man on the
       beat.

Teddy looks at O'Hara with a puzzled expression.

       O'HARA
       How do you do, sir ? It's nice to meet you.

O'Hara looks ill at ease under Teddy's stare.

       ABBY
       The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door.

O'Hara moves toward the pile of toys. Teddy's eyes are following
him with the same puzzled expression. O'Hara feels less and less
at ease.

       ABBY
       Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army
       and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed.

       REVEREND HARPER
       That's splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys
       for the kids at camp.

Teddy, who has started to mount the stairs to the upper level,
stops in his stride, pretends he is taking a sword out of a sheath
at his side, points this imaginary sword in front of him and
starts running up the stairs, yelling :

       TEDDY
       Charge !

When he arrives on the balcony, on which open the bedroom doors,
he rushes into his room and slams the door.

While Bophy and Reverend Harper remain unmoved, O'Hara, who is
standing by the grandfather's clock, jumps and looks at the clock,
which chimes once. The minute hand of the clock falls down to the
half-hour position. O'Hara is very disturbed and points his stick
to his Sargent, who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and
laughs with Reverend Harper and Abby.

       BROPHY
       It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the
       station. You get tired of playing cards.

Abby moves away from them to the grandfather's clock. She puts the
minute hand back into its original position. Brophy and Reverend
Harper joins her by the clock.

       BROPHY
       So these are the toys ?

O'Hara picks up the box in which the toys are stocked.

       ABBY
       How's Missis Brophy ?

       BROPHY
       Oh, she's better, thank you. But a little weak, still.

       ABBY
       Well, I'll better get some beef broth for you to take to
       her.

       BROPHY
       Oh, Miss Abby, please don't bother. You've done so much
       already.

       ABBY
       Oh, Stuff and nonsense ! I won't be a minute.

She moves away and exits into the kitchen.

       REVEREND HARPER
       Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness and absolute
       generosity are, it's because I've known the Brewster
       sisters.

On the balcony, Teddy gets out of his room with a bugle, and
starts playing it very loudly. O'Hara jumps and drops the box with
the toys on the floor. Reverend Harper and Brophy seem to be less
moved by the event.

Brophy stands back and points his finger up to Teddy.

       BROPHY
       Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore.

Teddy, still standing on the balcony, answers him leaning on the
balustrade.

       TEDDY
       But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of
       those supplies.

       BROPHY
       Now don't do that again. Do you hear me ?

Teddy goes back into his room, slamming the door behind him. The
grandfather's clock chimes once, and the minute hand falls back to
the half-hour position. O'Hara jumps and looks at the clock.

       BROPHY
       He used to do that in the middle of the night, and
       neighbors raised Cain with me. They're a little afraid of
       him anyway.

       O'HARA
       Look, Sarge, I promised you I wouldn't swear, but what the
       heck...

He stops in the middle of his sentence, gives a quick look to
Reverend Harper, and corrects himself.

       O'HARA
       ...What's going on here anyway ?

       REVEREND HARPER
       Oh, he's quite harmless.

       BROPHY
       He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. So what, there's a lot of
       worse guys he could think he was.

       O'HARA
       Huh ?

O'Hara gives a quick look toward the upper landing, and then nods.

       O'HARA
       That's right. I'll make a note of it. He's a very
       interesting character.

       BROPHY
       Isn't it a shame, Father, isn't it a shame, Reverend, that
       a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo ?

The front door opens and Martha Brewster comes in. Like her
sister, she looks like an old English lady. She is wearing a short
cape and a hat, and she carries a cylindrical can with a handle.

She closes the door.

       MARTHA
       Oh, well, now, isn't this nice !

She goes to Brophy and the Reverend.

       BROPHY
       Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.

       MARTHA
       How do you do, Mr Brophy ?

       REVEREND HARPER
       Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
O'Hara has picked up the toys and he joins the group.

       MARTHA
       Reverend Harper, how do you do ?

       BROPHY
       Oh, Miss Martha, this is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over
       my duties.

       O'HARA
       How do you do, ma'am ?

       MARTHA
       I'm very glad to know you.

Abby comes out of the kitchen, carrying a cylindrical can, similar
to the one her sister is carrying

       O'HARA
       Thank you.
Abby joins the group.

       ABBY
       Oh, Martha, you're back.

She gives the can to Brophy. Meanwhile, Martha has taken her cape
off.

       ABBY
       Here's the broth for Missis Brophy. Be sure it's good and
       hot.

       BROPHY
       You bet I will, and thank you very much.

Teddy is getting down the stairs, carrying a box full of toys
under his arm. He stops a few steps from floor level

       TEDDY
       The Army and Navy are ready for action.

He resumes his walking down the stairs.

       BROPHY
       Oh, Colonel, this is grand. It'll make a lot of kids happy.

Brophy takes the box from Teddy. Teddy looks into the box O'Hara
is carrying, and takes a model warship out of the box.

       TEDDY
       What's this ? The Oregon ?

       MARTHA
       Oh, Teddy, dear, put it back.

She has taken her hat off.

       TEDDY
       But the Oregon goes to Australia.

       ABBY
       Now, Teddy...

Teddy tucks the model ship under his arm. O'Hara looks at him with
puzzled eyes.

       TEDDY
       No, it goes to Australia.

       BROPHY
       These are lovely. Thank you very much.

       ABBY
       Not at all.

Brophy moves toward the front door. O'Hara follows him, still
looking at Teddy. Teddy doesn't seem to like the way he looks at
him, and moves the toy ship away from him.

       BROPHY
       The children will go crazy.

He has reached the front door. Abby has moved near the door, ready
to open it for him.

       ABBY
       Oh, now, don't mention it.

O'Hara salutes Teddy.

       O'HARA
       Well... So long, Colonel.

Teddy looks at him and then looks at Brophy, who doesn't salute
him. O'Hara elbows his Sargent with the arm which is saluting.

       O'HARA
       Hey, Sarge.

       BROPHY
       Hey ?

Brophy looks at Teddy and understands the situation. He also
salutes Teddy.

       BROPHY
       Oh, yes.

Teddy salutes them.

       TEDDY
       Dismissed !

Brophy and O'Hara bring their arms down.

       BROPHY
       Well, goodbye and thank you.
       ABBY
       Good bye.

Abby opens the front door. The two cops start going out, Brophy
first.

       ABBY
       Careful of the step here now with the toys.

       BROPHY
       Good night.

O'Hara goes out, and then comes one step back and shows his face
behind the door. He winks to Teddy. Teddy raises his eyebrows.

       TEDDY
       Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

O'Hara chuckles, then makes a strange face, and goes out.

       ABBY
       Goodbye.
She closes the door, and goes back to her sister and Reverend
Harper.

       ABBY
       Well...

       REVEREND HARPER
       Well, I must be going.

Teddy, still carrying his model warship, starts mounting the
stairs, stops after a few steps, takes his imaginary sword out,
points it forward and runs upstairs, yelling :

       TEDDY
       Charge !

He reaches the balcony, turns toward the balustrade and yells.

       TEDDY
       Charge the blockhouse !

He goes into his room and slams the door behind him. We hear the
grandfather's clock chiming once.

Reverend Harper looks up at the balcony, then turns to the
Brewster sisters with puzzled eyes.

       REVEREND HARPER
       Blockhouse ?

       MARTHA
       Oh, the stairs are always San Juan Hill.

       REVEREND HARPER
       Oh, I...

But Reverend Harper doesn't finish his sentence and sneezes very
loudly. He takes his handkerchief out of his pocket to put it
under his nose.

       ABBY
       Bless you !

       REVEREND HARPER
       Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasn't Teddy
       Roosevelt ?

       ABBY
       Oh, no !

She goes to the grandfather's clock.

       MARTHA
       Oh, he's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

Abby moves the minute hand of the clock back in place.

       ABBY
       Oh, do you remember, Martha ?
She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper.

       ABBY
       Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George
       Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested
       it.

       MARTHA
       And do you know what happened ? He just stayed under his
       bed for days and wouldn't be anybody.

Reverend Harper laughs.

       REVEREND HARPER
       Well, if he's happy, and what's more important, you're
       happy...

He starts walking toward the front door, followed by the Brewster
sisters. He reaches the door and opens it.

       MARTHA
       Oh, our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone.

They all go out.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

The three of them are coming out of the house.

       REVEREND HARPER
       Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.

       ABBY
       But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to
       Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on.

       REVEREND HARPER
       Splendid idea ! A very pleasant place.

       MARTHA
       Yes...

Reverend Harper put his hat back on his head, and starts walking
toward his own house.

       ABBY
       Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

The two sisters look at him. We see him cross the churchyard and
enter his house.

       ABBY
       You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see
       the light.

They start walking back to the door of their house.

       MARTHA
       I'm sure we needn't worry about him. He won't interfere
       with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

The two sisters enter their house. Martha closes the door.

       MARTHA
       Oh, did you just have tea ?

       ABBY
       Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too.

       MARTHA
       Ohh ! Why ?

They both turn their heads toward the stairs, because they just
heard Teddy's door slamming.

       ABBY
       Teddy ?...

She goes to the stairs, followed by Martha. Teddy is coming down.

       ABBY
       Oh, Teddy, good news for you. You're going to Panama and
       dig another lock for the canal.

She points her finger toward the cellar door. Martha seems
delighted by the news.

       TEDDY
       Delighted !

He rubs his hands

       TEDDY
       That's bully ! Just bully ! I shall prepare at once for the
       journey.
He starts mounting the stairs, stops and goes back a few steps
down, takes his imaginary sword out, points it forward, and runs
upstairs, yelling :

       TEDDY
       Charge !

Before Teddy slams his door, Abby put her hand on the face of the
clock to prevent the minute hand falling down.

       MARTHA
       Abby ! While I was out ?

       ABBY
       Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you. I didn't know when
       you'd be back, and Reverend Harper was coming.

       MARTHA
       But all by yourself.

       ABBY
       Oh, I got along fine.

       MARTHA
       I'll run right downstairs and see.

She goes to the cellar door.

       ABBY
       No, no, dear. There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

Martha looks around in the room, then looks at her sister with
questioning eyes.

       MARTHA
       Well ?

       ABBY
       Martha, just look in the window-seat.

She points to the large chest-bench under the window. Martha seems
delighted and both sisters go to the window-seat. They bend down
to raise the lid of the seat, when someone taps on the window
above the seat. The two sisters stand up and move the curtains
revealing Elaine's face.

       ABBY
       Oh ! It's Elaine !

Elaine raises the window and kisses the two sisters.

       ELAINE
       You, darlings.

She winks at them, and then runs away.

       MARTHA
       But, Elaine !
       ABBY
       What did she mean ? You don't suppose they've gone and...

Martha puts her hand over her mouth.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

A taxi cab has stopped in front of the Brewster sisters house. The
driver is half inside the back of his car, apparently looking for
something. Mortimer is already out of the cab. He is whistling. He
raises his hand and yells :

       MORTIMER
       Elaine !

Elaine is crossing the churchyard to go to her father's house. She
stops and turns around to look at Mortimer.

On one of the tombstones is engraved the name «Amanda Brewster»
and the dates : «1813-1863».

The Brewster sisters, who were bending out of their window to get
a better view of the scene, are coming back in, looking extremely
happy.

The cab driver gives his coat to Mortimer.

       CAB DRIVER
       Listen, buddy. This old cab has seen osculation but...

He whistles and goes back inside the back of the car to look for
other missing items.

       MORTIMER
       You ain't seen anything yet. You've got to drive us to the
       station.

The driver comes out of the cab, holding a hat.

       CAB DRIVER
       You'd better take her hat.

       MORTIMER
       Oh thanks.

The driver goes back inside the car.

       CAB DRIVER
       Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a... And her brooch.

He gives Mortimer the brooch.

       MORTIMER
       If you find her hairpins, you can keep them. Hold on to
       that.

He gives his coat back to the driver and runs away.

       CAB DRIVER
       Yeah !
Mortimer runs across the churchyard to meet Elaine.

We see the two Brewster sisters peeking behind the curtains of
their window.

       MARTHA
       There they are.

Mortimer gives Elaine her hat. She doesn't take it.

       MORTIMER
       Here's your hat.

       ELAINE
       Just throw it. I don't like that look in your eyes.

       MORTIMER
       What ? What's the matter ?

       ELAINE
       Father preached in sermon about it only last Sunday.
       MORTIMER
       He did ? He did ? What did he say ? What did he say ?

Elaine is trying to avoid Mortimer by going around a tree.

       ELAINE
       He was against it.

       MORTIMER
       Ah ! But that was only Sunday.

He chases her around the tree. They laugh. Mortimer starts
clowning.

       MORTIMER
       Please ! For heaven's sake !

       ELAINE
       But, Mortimer, right out here in the open with everyone
       looking ?

       MORTIMER
       Yeah ! Right out here in the open with everyone looking.
       Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

He starts chasing her again.

Behind their curtain, the two sisters are still peeking. They
laugh and then slightly move the curtains open a few inches to
have a better look.

Back to the tree. The couple is hidden by the tree. They separate
and move a little away from each other, each one of them appearing
on either side the tree.

Elaine drags Mortimer by the hand from behind the tree.
       ELAINE
       But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ?

       MORTIMER
       One thing at a time.

She starts running away from him.

       ELAINE
       Oh ! There's that look again !

Mortimer comes slowly from behind the tree, clowning.

       MORTIMER
       «There's that look again, Mortimer !» You better get used
       to it.

He becomes more serious and come closer to her.

       MORTIMER
       Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before
       this.
He kisses her very passionately.

       MORTIMER
       You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time.
       Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No,
       you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that
       cold of his into a pneumonia.

       ELAINE
       Oh, I can handle Father. He's a dear.

       MORTIMER
       Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ?

       ELAINE
       Niagara Falls ?

Mortimer nods.

       ELAINE
       Then that's why you stopped at your office.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara
       Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You
       should've seen my secretary's face when I made the
       reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train,
       the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning
       we go over the falls in a barrel.

Elaine kisses Mortimer very passionately.

       MORTIMER
       Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

       ELAINE
       I don't have to. I started packing the day after I met you.
She starts moving away. He holds her back.

       MORTIMER
       There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what
       I hate about women.

Mortimer kisses her.

Back to the cab driver who is pacing in front of his car. He rubs
his chin.

       CAB DRIVER
       I wonder what Mary's doing now ?

Mortimer and Elaine are still kissing. Mortimer lets go of Elaine.
He puts her hat on her head.

       MORTIMER
       Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry.

       ELAINE
       It'll be a few minutes before I'm ready. Father may want to
       pray over me a little.

She moves away.

       MORTIMER
       Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine...

She turns around.

       ELAINE
       Yeah.

       MORTIMER
       When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a
       tall, dark streak of light, it's me.

He starts running toward his aunts' house. Elaine runs to her
father's house.

She stops at the door of her house and starts whistling.

Mortimer, who had also reached his door, stops and turns around.

       MORTIMER
       What ? Now ?

He starts running toward her, but she stops him.

       ELAINE
       No, not now !

She opens her door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

The two sisters are eagerly waiting for Mortimer. Martha whispers.
       MARTHA
       Look surprised when he tells us.

Abby laughs. They hear a door slamming in the next room.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !

Mortimer rushes into the room and throws his hat on a chair.

       MORTIMER
       Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are
       married.

The two sisters hug and kiss Mortimer.

       ABBY
       Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it
       wonderful ? They're married!

       MORTIMER
       Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old
       frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ?

       ABBY
       Yes, of course.

Mortimer goes to the telephone, followed by his two aunts.

       ABBY
       Isn't it too, too wonderful ?

Mortimer sits at the small desk on which the telephone is, and
whistles while dialing.

       MARTHA
       And to think that it happened right here in this room !

She dabs her nose with her handkerchief.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's
       Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those
       roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good.
       Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian
       Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And
       throw in a flock of orange blossoms.

He puts the telephone receiver back on his hook, and he turns on
his chair to face his aunts, his arms resting on the back of the
chair.

       ABBY
       But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a
       bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of
       the neighbors in.

       MARTHA
       And, of course, a wedding cake.
       MORTIMER
       Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're
       going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting.

       ABBY
       Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since..

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her,
       huh ?

He stands up.

       MORTIMER
       What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting
       married, except me ?

       MARTHA
       Oh, we knew you'd find out about it in time.

Mortimer laughs and hugs his aunts.
       MORTIMER
       Come here. I've got the two nicest aunts in the world. Of
       course, you've got the nicest nephew in the world, too.

Martha moves away to the kitchen.

       MARTHA
       Well, I'll run along and get everything ready.

       ABBY
       Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend isn't too angry. You know
       how your books upset him.

       MORTIMER
       Well, I'm going to burn all my books. And I'll let the
       Reverend Harper light the first match. Oh, by the way, did
       I leave some notes here for my new book ?

       ABBY
       You mean «Mind Over Matrimony» ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes ! Shhh ! Where are they ?

       ABBY
       I hid them someplace...

Abby turns to go searching, and Mortimer pats her behind.

       MORTIMER
       Come on, come on. Let's go.

Abby turns back to him.

       ABBY
       Now you behave.
She goes away on her search.

       MORTIMER
       Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony. He is dressed in full
colonial costume, complete with pith helmet. He is carrying a
shovel and his bugle is stuck in his belt. He walks rapidly down
the stairs.

He stops a few steps from the ground floor, when he spots
Mortimer. He seems very happy to see him.

       TEDDY
       Hello, Mortimer !

They shake hands.

       MORTIMER
       How are you, Mister President ?

       TEDDY
       Bully, thank you. Just bully. What news have you brought
       me ?

Teddy takes off his pince-nez.

       MORTIMER
       Just this, Mister President. The country's squarely behind
       you.

       TEDDY
       Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful ?

He puts his pince-nez back on his nose, and shakes hands again
with Mortimer.

       TEDDY
       Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

Teddy walks to the cellar door. Mortimer bends slightly.

       MORTIMER
       Goodbye, Mister President.

Before he opens the door, Teddy turns to Mortimer.

       TEDDY
       A new lock for the canal, you know.

He opens the door, and starts walking down the steps to the
cellar. Before the door closes back, we can hear him singing :

       TEDDY
       «Oh, tell the news to Mother».

Abby is still looking for Mortimer's note, and, in a drawer, she
finds a piece of paper that seems to annoy her.

       ABBY
       Oh, dear.

       MORTIMER
       Did you find those notes ?

Mortimer senses there is something wrong in his aunt's voice, and
walks to her.

       MORTIMER
       What's the matter ?

She holds the paper for Mortimer to take it.

       ABBY
       There's a baby picture of your brother Jonathan.

Mortimer takes the picture and looks at it.

INSERT - Close-up of the picture. It shows a very ugly child with
a very strange face.

       MORTIMER
       You ought to put that in the fire with my books. My, what a
       face !

He gives the picture back to Abby.

       MORTIMER
       I remember now. He used to scare grownups with it.

Mortimer walks away from his aunt.

       ABBY
       Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember
       how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth ?

Mortimer is searching on the small telephone desk.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, Jonathan ? Oh, he's probably in prison or hanged or
       something by now.

He walks across the room and starts searching on the table.

       MORTIMER
       I saw a play, which had a character in it. Reminded me of
       Jonathan.

       ABBY
       No ? Really?

While talking, they both keep on searching everywhere in the room.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah. Oh, a honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits
       called «Murder Will Out».

       ABBY
       Oh, dear !
Abby goes into the kitchen.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up, the first
       thing you see is a dead body.

While talking, he keeps on searching and opens the lid of the
window-seat. He gives its insides a quick look and closes it back,
and then moves away.

       MORTIMER
       The next thing...

He stops in his tracks and looks back at the window-seat. He jumps
back to it, opens the lid and closes it very quickly. He then sits
on the seat with a frightened look on his face. Slowly, he kneels
down on the floor, and opens the lid again, but very slowly. He
talks to whatever, or whomever, is in the seat.

       MORTIMER
       Hey, mister.
He remains a few seconds seated of the seat, with a very puzzled
face.

We hear Elaine whistling. Mortimer tries to whistle back, but no
sound comes from his mouth. He tries again, but with no more
success. He seems in shock.

He looks at the kitchen, then at the seat. There is horror on his
face.

His two aunts come from the kitchen, singing and carrying things
for the celebration.

Mortimer shows a forced smile.

The two sisters puts things on the table, then they come to
Mortimer, who is still seated on the window-seat. Abby is carrying
a big bowl of rice, and the two girls start throwing rice on him.

       ABBY
       Happy bridegroom !

       MARTHA
       Congratulations, darling !

       MORTIMER
       Never mind that now. I know.

Mortimer takes the bowl from Abby's hands and put it on a small
table. He remains seated while his aunts are standing in front of
him.

       MORTIMER
       Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how
       we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium,
       Happy Dale ?

       ABBY
       Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

They move away to start setting the table.

       ABBY
       Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it.

       MORTIMER
       No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now,
       he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away.

       MARTHA
       But, there's no such hurry as yet, you know.

       ABBY
       No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his
       mind on anything else.

Mortimer stands up and comes to the table where his aunts are
working.

       MORTIMER
       Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've
       got an awful shock for you.

He takes Abby's hands in his.

       MORTIMER
       Teddy's killed a man, darlings !

Martha laughs.

       MARTHA
       Nonsense !

       MORTIMER
       (he yells)
       But there's a body in the window-seat !

       ABBY
       Yes, dear. We know.

Mortimer looks even more shocked than before. His two aunts keep
on setting the table as if nothing had happened.

       MORTIMER
       You know ?

       MARTHA
       Of course.

       ABBY
       Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

Mortimer wants to speak, but Abby stops him.

       ABBY
       Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever
       saw the gentleman.
       MORTIMER
       Forget ?

       ABBY
       We never dreamed you'd peek.

       MORTIMER
       What the... Who is he ?

       ABBY
       He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I
       know about him, except that he's a Methodist.

       MARTHA
       Oh ! He's a Methodist ? Isn't that nice.

       MORTIMER
       That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What
       happened to him ?

Mortimer is more and more shocked and his aunts, very calmly, keep
on putting plates and silverware on the table.
       MARTHA
       He died.

       MORTIMER
       Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and
       die.

       ABBY
       No, dear. He died first.

Mortimer takes his aunts' hands to stop them from setting the
table.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this.

He takes Abby's hands in his.

       MORTIMER
       Now look, darlings, how did he die ?

       ABBY
       Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died
       because he drank some wine with poison in it.

       MORTIMER
       But, how did the poison get in the wine ?

       MARTHA
       Well we put it in wine because it's less noticeable.
       When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

       MORTIMER
       You mean you...
       (yelling)
       You put it in the wine ?
       ABBY
       Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because
       Reverend Harper was coming.

Mortimer seems ready to faint.

       MORTIMER
       Ohh ! Look at me, darling.

He takes again Abby's hands in his.

       MORTIMER
       You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't
       want the Reverend Harper to see the body ?

       ABBY
       Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.

Abby goes back table-setting and Mortimer holds himself on the
edge of the table.

       MORTIMER
       Ohh ! It's first-degree.

       ABBY
       Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about
       it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own
       little secrets.

Martha walks to the kitchen door, but she stops and turns around.

       MARTHA
       Oh, Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz.
       She's much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the
       movies again.

       ABBY
       Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day.

       MARTHA
       Yes, but this time we'll go where we want to go. Junior's
       not going to drag me into another one of those scary
       pictures.

The two sisters enter the kitchen.

       ABBY
       No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures
       just to frighten people.

Mortimer remains alone in the room. He has the face of someone who
thinks he is having a nightmare and hopes to wake up soon.

He goes to the telephone desk, picks up the phone and dials «0».

       MORTIMER
       Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?...
       Are you sure ?...

He puts the phone down.
       MORTIMER
       Then I must be here.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Elaine is appearing of her room in her father's house. She has got
her purse and her gloves. She plays with a large artificial
flower. She whistles.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer, half-seated on the telephone desk, comes out of his
dream, and goes to the window. By signs only, he tries to explain
to Elaine that he's got a problem with the window-seat. We don't
see her, but we imagine she doesn't understand, because Mortimer
rushes to the kitchen.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer rushes into the kitchen.
       MORTIMER
       Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha !

He stops abruptly. A group of costumed and masked children are
gathered behind the window. Martha is distributing watermelons,
pumpkins and pies to them. The children are saying
incomprehensible words of thanking.

Martha closes the window on them, and switches on the lights.

       ABBY
       Oh, the dears. Isn't Halloween a wonderful time for them ?

       MARTHA
       Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

They both go back to their cooking work in the kitchen. Martha is
preparing some kind of desert in a bowl.

       MARTHA
       Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient. We'll let you lick
       the bowl out.

       MORTIMER
       Lick the bowl ? I don't want to lick the bowl. I want to
       know what we're going to do !

       MARTHA
       Well, we're going to celebrate, dear.

       MORTIMER
       Celebrate ? There's a body in the window-seat !

       ABBY
       Yes, dear. Mister Hoskins.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, I know what his name is. I just want to know what we're
       going to do. We can't turn you over to the police.

Mortimer paces the kitchen, while his aunts are busy cooking.

       ABBY
       Yes. You just should get stop worrying about it.

       MARTHA
       We told you to forget the whole thing.

       MORTIMER
       (yelling)
       Forget ? Look, my dear aunt Martha, can't I make you
       realize that something has to be done ?

Abby leaves the stove where she was working and comes to the
table.

       ABBY
       Now, Mortimer, you behave. You're too old to be flying off
       the handle like this.
       MORTIMER
       But, but Mister Hodgekiss...

       ABBY
       Hoskins, dear.

       MORTIMER
       But whatever his name is, you can't leave him in there.

       MARTHA
       We don't intend to, dear.

       ABBY
       No, Teddy's down in the cellar now, digging the lock.

Mortimer looks very shocked.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, you mean you're going to bury Mister Hodgekiss in the
       cellar ?

       MARTHA
       Oh, yes, dear. That's what we did with the others.

       MORTIMER
       Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...

He comes close to the table where Martha is working. And all of a
sudden, he seems to realize what she just said.

       MORTIMER
       Others ?

       MARTHA
       The other gentlemen.

       MORTIMER
       Oh ! When you say «others», do you mean «others» ? More
       than one «others» ?

Martha laughs.

       MARTHA
       Oh, yes, dear. Let me see now. This is eleven, isn't it,
       Abby ?

       ABBY
       Oh no, dear. This makes twelve.

       MARTHA
       Abby, dear, I think you're wrong. This one is only eleven.

       ABBY
       No, dear, because I remember when Mister Hoskins first came
       in, it occurred to me that he'd make just an even dozen.

Mortimer seems completely dejected and he sits down, not even
listening to his aunts anymore.

       MARTHA
       But, look, Abby dear, I really don't think you should count
       the first one.

       ABBY
       Oh, I was counting the first one, and that makes it twelve.

       MARTHA
       It does ?

Abby, who is sucking her finger, nods to answer.

       MARTHA
       Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is. I get them
       mixed up sometimes.

       MORTIMER
       Makes it twelve. Well...

The telephone rings. Mortimer puts his hand to his ear.

       MORTIMER
       Hello ?

He suddenly realizes that he doesn't have a telephone in his hand.

       MORTIMER
       Oh !

He rushes out of the kitchen.

       ABBY
       Well, whatever is the matter with Mortimer today ?

       MARTHA
       Why, Abby, what do you think happened to him ?

They walk out of the kitchen.
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer sits at the telephone desk and picks up the phone.

       MORTIMER
       Hello ?

We hear some whistling, coming from the telephone. Mortimer takes
the receiver a bit away from his ear, surprised. Then he takes it
back.

       MORTIMER
       Not now. Not now. For heaven's sake, keep your shirt on !

He slams the phone down on his hook. Then he realizes he has been
rude, and picks it up again.

       MORTIMER
       Oh... Oh, Elaine, I didn't mean...

He realizes there is no one on the phone, and puts it back down.
       MORTIMER
       Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve.
       (he yells)
       Twelve !

He jumps from his chair and rushes toward the kitchen. But, when
he sees his two aunts setting the table, he stops and goes to
them.

       MARTHA
       Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one.

       MORTIMER
       Never mind about that. Just sit down.

Martha sits down.

       MORTIMER
       Now, tell me, who was the first one ?

       ABBY
       Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist.

       MARTHA
       He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was.

       ABBY
       All his kith and kin were dead.

       MARTHA
       We felt so sorry for him.

       ABBY
       And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead
       in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We
       made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help
       other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would.
       MORTIMER
       Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this
       chair ?

Mortimer realizes it's the chair he's sitting on, and stands up
very quickly.

       ABBY
       And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama,
       and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim.
       And that meant he had to be buried immediately.

       MORTIMER
       So ?

       MARTHA
       So, we all took him down to Panama, and put him in the lock
       and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you
       see ?
       (she stands up)
       That's why we told you not to bother about it, because we
       know exactly what's to be done.
Mortimer is sitting on the table, and seems not to know what he
must do next. But he suddenly stands up.

       MORTIMER
       Wait a minute !

He rushes to his aunts.

       MORTIMER
       Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of
       them didn't walk in here and drop dead.

       ABBY
       Oh, no, dear. Of course not !

       MORTIMER
       Well, so, so...

Abby whispers something in Martha's ear. Martha looks at Mortimer,
smiles, and whispers back in her sister's ear.

       MARTHA
       Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       Wh... what?

       MARTHA
       Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the
       shelves in Grandfather's laboratory all these years ?

       ABBY
       You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things.
       You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

       MARTHA
       Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one
       teaspoonful of arsenic, then add half a teaspoonful of
       strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

       MORTIMER
       Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick.

       ABBY
       Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time
       to say : «How delicious !»

       MORTIMER
       He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ?

       MARTHA
       Abby, we mustn't be standing here gossiping all night.
       Well, we must get that cake frosted.

She moves toward the kitchen, followed by Abby.

       MORTIMER
       Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat
       a thing.
       ABBY
       Oh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite.

       MORTIMER
       That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine !

He stands up.

       MORTIMER
       Wine !

He wants to move away, but his foot get entangled in the back of a
chair, and he almost falls down.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Elaine appears at the window of her room. She is arranging the
artificial flower on the lapel of her jacket. She moves away from
the window.

The cab driver is still pacing on the sidewalk near his car.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer closes the drapes between the sitting-room and the next
room. He then goes to the cellar door and opens the door ajar. A
cat meows and comes out through the opening. We hear Teddy singing
down in the cellar.

       MORTIMER
       I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

He listens to the singing coming from the cellar.

       MORTIMER
       He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging
       locks.
He closes the cellar door.

       MORTIMER
       Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the
       headlines now : «Murder Incorporator Rides Again» right
       across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course.
       Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ?
       Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old
       Judge Cullman !

He starts moving across the room, putting his hand in the inside
breast pocket of his jacket.

       MORTIMER
       I wonder if I got his number.

He gets a couple of tickets out of his pocket. He sits at the
small telephone desk.

       MORTIMER
       What am I doing with tickets ?
He throws the tickets on the desk. He picks up the phone, and
starts dialing.

       MORTIMER
       Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number
       of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would
       you call me back ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The night has come. Elaine is walking very rapidly on the
sidewalk. She passes near the taxi. The driver opens the door for
her, but she keeps on walking.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is standing by the window-seat. All the drapes are
closed. He bends down.

       MORTIMER
       How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there.

He slowly opens the lid of the seat. When the lid is a few inches
open, he peeks inside.

       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       Hey, you !

When he hears Elaine's voice, Mortimer slams the lid down and sit
on the seat.

       ELAINE
       Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

She is standing by the half-open door, and she makes the gestures
Mortimer made when he had told her the same sentence, earlier in
the churchyard.

       MORTIMER
       What are you doing here?

       ELAINE
       What am I doing here ? Didn't you hear me whistle ?

       MORTIMER
       Whistle ? Oh, yes, yes. I heard you whistle. But...

He stands up and comes to her in the middle of the room. He gives
her a quick kiss.

       ELAINE
       Hey, how do I look ?

She pivots to show him the way she is dressed.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, you look fine, you look fine. Now, run on home. I'll
       call you up tomorrow.
       ELAINE
       Tomorrow ?

He pushes her toward the door.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, you know I always call you up every day or two.

She laughs.

       ELAINE
       Oh ! you and your gags ! Where's your hat ? Come on. The
       bags are in the taxi.

       MORTIMER
       Huh ? Taxi ? Huh, huh, huh ?

She is pulling him toward the door.

       ELAINE
       Yeah, come on !

       MORTIMER
       Oh, Elaine, I'm so sorry. But something's happened.

       ELAINE
       What'd you do, lose your nerve ? Hey, where's that look
       I was going to see so often ?

She takes his head to bring her mouth close to his ear, and then
she starts whistling. He moves away and rubs his ear.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, stop ! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer, what is wrong ? Look at your hair.
He bends down for her to see his hair better.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, my God, what color is it ? Quick ! Has it turned ?

       ELAINE
       Oh, darling, what's the matter ? What happened ?

She starts stroking his face. He bends down on her shoulder.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, Elaine, if I could only tell you, Elaine. You smell so
       nice.

The phone rings. Mortimer jumps up

       MORTIMER
       Oh ! Oh !

He pushes her out through the open door.
       MORTIMER
       You better go home !

       ELAINE
       But, darling, we were married today.

       MORTIMER
       All right, go home, go to bed, get some rest !

       ELAINE
       Rest ?

He slams the door on her, and rushes to the telephone. He sits
down at the desk and picks up the phone.

       MORTIMER
       Who ? Who ? Judge Cullman ?

The front door opens, and Elaine comes back inside the house.

       MORTIMER
       This is Mortimer Brewster. Look, Judge, I'll tell you why I
       called you. It's about Teddy.

Elaine crosses the room and sits on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       I've got to come over and see you right away. Oh, I'm
       afraid it won't wait until tomorrow, Judge. Yeah, you see,
       it's very, very important. We've got to do something about
       it immediately. But it's practically a matter of life
       and...

Mortimer turns his head and sees Elaine sitting on the window-
seat. He drops the phone on the desk, and yells :

       MORTIMER
       Elaine !
Elaine, frightened, jumps up from the seat. Mortimer rushes to
her.

       MORTIMER
       Will you get out of here ?

       ELAINE
       Mortimer, what in the world is going on around here ? I
       don't even know where I stand !

       MORTIMER
       Anywhere, but don't stand there !

He moves her away from the window-seat.

       ELAINE
       But, darling, Niagara Falls !

       MORTIMER
       If it does, we'll let it !
       ELAINE
       Now, wait a minute ! Listen. You can't marry me one minute
       and then throw me out the house the next !

       MORTIMER
       Oh, darling, I'm not throwing you out of the house !

He lifts her and actually throws her out of the house

       MORTIMER
       Will you get out of here ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine bumps into an old man, Mr. Gibbs, standing just outside the
entrance of the house. He is holding a newspaper in his hand.

She comes back to the door, but Mortimer slams it in her face.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer locks the door and goes back to the phone

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine is knocking desperately on the door. Gibbs is still behind
her.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer !

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is back sitting at the desk and talking into the phone.
In the background, we hear Elaine's pounding on the door.

       MORTIMER
       I'm sorry, Judge. But... a thing happened. But, Judge,
       about Teddy, you see...

       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       Mortimer !

       MORTIMER
       Hold it. You see, Judge, it's his bugle blowing. Yes, the
       neighbors have been complaining, and the police are all set
       to throw him into a state institution.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine seems quite angry.

       ELAINE
       How do you like that ?

Gibbs shows his newspaper to Elaine

       GIBBS
       I read an ad here about a room to rent.
       ELAINE
       Oh ! Shut up !

She walks away, leaving Gibbs at the door. She walks quickly by
the taxi. The driver opens the door for her, but she walks on with
quick steps.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is still on the phone.

       MORTIMER
       Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get
       Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes,
       it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll
       be over right as soon as I've made another call.

The front door bell rings.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Gibbs is standing by the door, ringing the bell.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby comes in the room from the kitchen. Mortimer is still on the
phone.

       ABBY
       Doorbell's ringing, dear.

She crosses the room to the front door. She opens the door,
revealing Gibbs.

       ABBY
       Oh, how do you do ? Come in.
The kitchen door has remained open, and we see Martha still
working on her cooking.

       GIBBS
       (voice over)
       I understand you've got a room to rent.

Hearing that, Martha drops her cooking and comes into the room.

       ABBY
       Yes... Do step in.

Abby opens the door wide for him to get in.

       GIBBS
       Well, are you the lady of the house ?

       ABBY
       Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please.

Martha has joined her sister.

       ABBY
       And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster.

Gibbs takes off his hat.

       GIBBS
       My name's Gibbs.

Quick shot on Mortimer, still on the phone. He gives a quick look
toward his aunts, but doesn't seem interested.

       ABBY
       Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the
       table for dinner.

She moves an armchair on the other side of the table.

       ABBY
       Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair.

Back to Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale
       Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

Back to Gibbs and the sisters.

       ABBY
       Is Brooklyn your home ?

       GIBBS
       I haven't got a home. I live in a hotel. Don't like it.
       MARTHA
       A... are your family Brooklyn people ?

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Hello ? Hap...

       GIBBS
       Haven't got any family.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Well, operator...

       ABBY
       All alone in the world ?

       GIBBS
       Yeah.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       No, no...

Abby looks at her sister with a knowing smile.

       ABBY
       Well, Martha....

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       No, Happy Dale... Yes.

       ABBY
       Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down.

She helps him sit down in the armchair, while Martha is bringing a
carafe of wine and a glass.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Dale. «D» like in «dig», you know, when you dig a lock.
       That's right. «A» like in «arsenic». Got that ?

Short close-up on the carafe of wine, now on the table.

       GIBBS
       Is there always this much noise ?

       MARTHA
       Oh ! He doesn't live with us.

Mortimer is standing, with the telephone set in one hand, and the
receiver on his ear in the other hand. He whispers.

       MORTIMER
       I can see the headlines now. Oh, please.
       (back to normal voice)
       Hello ?
Back to the table.

       GIBBS
       I'd really like to see the room. Well, I don't think I'll
       like it.

He stands up and takes his hat, which he had put on the table.

       ABBY
       The room's upstairs.

Abby is seated at the table, with Martha standing behind her. She
takes the carafe.

       ABBY
       Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ?

       GIBBS
       Never touch it.

       MARTHA
       Well, we make this ourselves. It's elderberry wine.
       GIBBS
       Elderberry ?

He puts his hat back on the table and sits down.

       GIBBS
       I haven't tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Oh...

       GIBBS
       Thank you.

Abby starts pouring the wine in the glass.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Operator ! Well, I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry !
       I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium ! Sanitarium !
       Sanitarium ! Sanitarium ! Yes, like a broken record !

Gibbs takes the glass from Abby.

       GIBBS
       Have your own elderberry bushes ?

       MARTHA
       No, but the cemetery's full of them.

Gibbs raises his glass.

       GIBBS
       Well, skoal.

In the background, Mortimer is yelling louder and louder. Gibbs,
who had the glass almost to his lips, puts it down. The two
sisters watch him with expecting eyes.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Hello, operator! No, operator, what's taking you so long ?
       It's only across the river ! I could swim it faster ! Yes !
       Hello ! Hello...

Gibbs, who had taken the glass back to his lips, put it down once
more.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       What ?... What, they're busy ? Busy ? They're busy and
       you're dizzy ! No, I'm not drunk, madam, but you've given
       me an idea !

A noise of chairs and various objects falling.

Mortimer comes to the table and takes the carafe and a glass.
Abby, concentrated on Gibbs raising the glass to his lips again,
doesn't see him, but Martha does, and seems very anxious about it.
She taps her two forefingers together.

       MARTHA
       Mortimer ! Ah-ah ah-ah !...

Mortimer keeps on pouring the wine in the glass

       MORTIMER
       Darling, don't «ah-ah ah-ah», I'm nervous. Don't do this.

Abby sees him. She turns around, and very calmly, holds the hand
which is holding the glass.

       ABBY
       Mortimer. Not that.

He puts the glass down, and suddenly realizes the situation. He
looks at Gibbs, who has taken the glass to his lips. He yells and
Gibbs, frightened, stands up and drops the glass on the floor.
Mortimer points his finger at him.

       MORTIMER
       Get out of here ! Do you want to be poisoned, do you want
       to be murdered, do you want to be killed ? Do you ?

Gibbs grabs his hat and runs to the front door. Mortimer runs
after him and falls over an armchair standing in his way. The two
sisters seem very upset.

Gibbs gets out and slams the door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Gibbs runs out of the house, and stops by the cab driver, who is
seated near his taxi, smoking a cigarette.

       GIBBS
       They... they're nuts !

       CAB DRIVER
       Hey, you're telling me !

Gibbs runs away in the street.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The two sisters are seated on the window-seat. Mortimer slowly
raises himself from the overturned armchair.

       MORTIMER
       Look, you can't do things like that !

He stands up and puts the armchair back on its legs.

       MORTIMER
       Now I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's
       not only against the law, it's wrong.

He walks slowly toward them.
       ABBY
       Oh, piffle !

Both sisters are sulking.

       MORTIMER
       It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.

He points to the front door and the departed Mr. Gibbs.

       MORTIMER
       He wouldn't understand. What I mean is... Well... This is
       developing into a very bad habit !

The telephone rings.

       MORTIMER
       Oh... Yes...

He goes to the desk, sits on the chair, and picks up the phone.

       MORTIMER
       Hello ?... Who ?... Oh, Happy Dale Sanitarium ? Oh, that's
       amazing, operator. Yeah... Happy Dale ? Oh, let me talk to
       Mister Witherspoon, please.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Witherspoon is sitting behind his desk, the telephone receiver to
his ear.

       WITHERSPOON
       Mr. Witherspoon speaking... Oh, how do you do, Mister
       Brewster ? How are you ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Mortimer is still at the desk, telephoning.

       MORTIMER
       Uh... uh... Well, Mister Witherspoon, do you... Oh, I'm
       fine, thanks. How are you ? Mister Witherspoon, do you
       remember that conversation we had about committing my
       brother Teddy to Happy Dale ?... You do ? Well, we want to
       commit him there immediately.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, that's too bad. Well, I'd hoped we
       wouldn't have him for some time yet. Well, you see, Mister
       Brewster, we have several Theodore Roosevelts at the
       moment, and it would lead to trouble. Oh, trouble... Oh,
       now, if he thought that... Look, Mr. Brewster, we're a bit
       short of Napoleons at present. The Bonaparte. And if...
       Oh... oh, I see. Of course. Well, if your mind is made up.
       Yes. Yes. Have you had the papers drawn up ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
       MORTIMER
       No, but I'm going to attend to it right now and call you as
       soon as I have them. Thank you, Mister... What ?... All
       right. Thank you, Mister Witherspoon.

He puts the phone down.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Witherspoon puts his phone down

       WITHERSPOON
       Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear, dear.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer goes back to his aunts, still sitting on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       Now listen, darlings. I've got to run over to Judge
       Cullman's, but, before I go, I want you to promise me
       something.

       MARTHA
       Well, we'd have to know what it was first.

       MORTIMER
       Well, I love you both very much. And you know I'd do
       anything in the world for you, don't you ?

       ABBY
       Yes, dear.

       MORTIMER
       All right, then I want you to do one little thing for me,
       like good girls.
       ABBY
       What do you want us to do ?

       MORTIMER
       Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let
       anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is.
       Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't
       concentrate.

He makes them stand up from the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world
       to happen to either of you.

       ABBY
       But, what on earth could happen to us?

       MORTIMER
       Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for
       me, won't you ? All right.
Abby nods.

       MORTIMER
       Where's my hat ? There it is.

He leaves them to pick up his hat.

       MARTHA
       But, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       What, darling, what ?

       MARTHA
       We were planning to hold services before dinner.

       MORTIMER
       Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ?

       ABBY
       Oh, and you could join us in the hymns !

       MORTIMER
       Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with
       you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But...
       remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back.
       You promise ?

Abby and Martha nod.

       MORTIMER
       Good.

He puts the hat on his head. The hat is ostensibly to large for
him. He opens the front door

       ABBY
       (voice over)
       Mortimer !

He was almost out, but he turns around.

       MORTIMER
       What ?

Abby points to the hat, but can't talk.

       ABBY
       Uh-uh-uh-uh !...

       MORTIMER
       Stop that «uh-uh-uh». What is it ?

       ABBY
       Mr. Hoskins' hat !

Mortimer raises his eyes, and tears the had off his head

       MORTIMER
       Ohhhh !...

He throws the hat away, leaves and closes the door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The cab driver is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk near his
taxi.

Mortimer comes running out of the house. The driver goes toward
him.

       CAB DRIVER
       Do you still want me to wait here ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes ! Call me a cab !

       CAB DRIVER
       Yeah. Okay, okay !

They run together and stop in front of the parked taxi. The driver
waves his arm.

       CAB DRIVER
       Hey, cab !... Here you are.

Another taxi stops near the first one. The driver wants to open
the back door for Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       Don't open it. I'll sit with you !

       CAB DRIVER
       Yeah, that's right. I can go faster that way. Sure.

Mortimer climbs in the front of the taxi, next to the driver. The
taxi drives away, and the first driver remains on the street,
touching his cap.

       CAB DRIVER
       Wait a minute ! What am I doing ? Hey !

He pats his own taxi, points his finger to it and waves for the
other taxi to come back.

       CAB DRIVER
       Come here !

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby picks up Mr. Hoskins' hat. She brushes it with her hand and
gives it to Martha.

       ABBY
       Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up.

       MARTHA
       Shame ! Such a nice hat.
She crosses the room and, takes a brush on a cupboard near the
window-seat, and starts brushing the hat.

       MARTHA
       You know, Abby, Mortimer didn't seem to be quite himself
       today.

Abby brings two candlesticks on the table

       ABBY
       No. Oh, well.

Martha opens the cupboard, which is full of man's hats. She puts
Hoskins' hat with the others, and then closes the cupboard

       MARTHA
       Well, what were you saying about Mortimer ?

Abby has lit the candles.

       ABBY
       Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset.

       MARTHA
       Why ?

       ABBY
       He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a
       little nervous.

       MARTHA
       Oh, yes. The poor dears.

She crosses the room to the door to switch off the lights

       MARTHA
       I'm so happy for Elaine. Oh, Abby ! If Mortimer's coming
       back for the services for Mr. Hoskins, we're going to need
       another hymnal. There's one up in my room.

Knocks at the front door. Through the frosted window-panels of the
door, we see the shadows of two men.

       ABBY
       Oh, I'll go, dear.

       MARTHA
       Abby, we promised Mortimer we wouldn't let anyone come in.

More knocks at the door. Martha peeks through the drapes of a
convenient window, a few steps above floor-level on the staircase.

       MARTHA
       Abby ! Two men, and I've never seen them before.

       ABBY
       Are you sure ?

       MARTHA
       Yes.
       ABBY
       Let me look.

Abby climbs the steps and comes near her sister to peek through
the drapes

       MARTHA
       You look.

The two shadows knock again.

       MARTHA
       Do you recognize them ?

       ABBY
       No, they're strangers to me.

       MARTHA
       Well, we'll just have to pretend we're not at home.

The front door opens. The tallest of the two men, dressed in black
and wearing a large hat, comes in first. The other one, shorter
and hatless, follows him.

We get a close-up of the face of the tall man, actually Jonathan
Brewster. It's full of scars and it makes him look a bit like
Boris Karloff in the Frankenstein films. He looks around the room.

       JONATHAN
       Come in, doctor.

Doctor Einstein, who was waiting at the door, comes into the room,
and closes the door behind him.

       JONATHAN
       This is the home of my youth. As a boy, I couldn't wait to
       escape from this house. Now I'm glad to escape back into
       it.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

He takes a small bottle from an inside pocket of his jacket, and
takes a sip at it.

       JONATHAN
       The family must still live here. I hope there's a fatted
       calf awaiting the return of the prodigal.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       A fatted calf ? Oh, Johnny, I'm so hungry.

He comes closer to the table.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Look, Johnny. Drink.

       JONATHAN
       As if we were expected.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes.

       JONATHAN
       A good omen.

Einstein pours some wine from the carafe in a glass. Jonathan
takes a glass already full on the table.

Abby gets down the few steps, followed by Martha.

       ABBY
       Who are you ? What are you doing here ?

The two men put their glasses down on the table

       JONATHAN
       Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha. It's Jonathan.

       MARTHA
       You, you get out of here !

       JONATHAN
       I'm Jonathan, you know. Your nephew, Jonathan.

He takes his hat off.

       ABBY
       Oh no, you're not. You're nothing like Jonathan, so don't
       pretend you are. You just get out of here.

She points to the door.

       JONATHAN
       I see you're still wearing the lovely garnet ring that
       Grandma Brewster bought in England. And you, Aunt Martha,
       still the high collar to hide the scar where Grandfather's
       acid burned you.

       MARTHA
       Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

       ABBY
       Have, have you been in an accident ?

       JONATHAN
       My face. Doctor Einstein is responsible for that. He's a
       plastic surgeon.

       MARTHA
       But I've seen that face before. Do you remember when we
       took the little Schultz boy to the movies and I was so
       frightened ? It was that face.

Jonathan turns around and look harshly at Einstein, who seems a
bit uneasy.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy. Don't worry. The last
       five years, I give him three different faces. I give him
       another one right away. That last face. I saw that picture,
       too, just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

Jonathan grabs Einstein's collar and squeezes it.

       JONATHAN
       You see, doctor, what you've done to me ? Even my own
       family think I'm...

Einstein has breathing problems because of Jonathan's squeezing.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Johnny, Johnny ! You are home in this lovely house.

Jonathan lets go of Einstein, who walks toward the two sisters.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You know how many times he tells me about... about
       Brooklyn, about this house, and about his aunts he loves so
       much ? They know you, Johnny. Please tell him so.

       ABBY
       Well, Jonathan, it's been a long time.

Jonathan sits down.

       JONATHAN
       Bless you. It's good to be home again.

Abby turns toward Martha, and then goes down the few last steps to
floor level.

       ABBY
       Well, Martha, we mustn't let what's on the stove boil over.

She picks up the glasses on the table.
       ABBY
       If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan. Unless you're
       in a hurry to go somewhere.

She goes to the kitchen with the glasses. Martha picks up the wine
carafe, to the disappointment of Dr. Einstein, and follows her
sister toward the kitchen. Before entering the kitchen, she puts
the carafe back on the shelf where it was before. She then closes
the kitchen door after her.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Well, Johnny, where do we go from here ? You know, Johnny,
       we got to think fast.

Close-up on the hands of Jonathan playing with a metallic brain-
teaser.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       The police, they got pictures of that face. I got to
       operate on you right away. We got to find someplace. We got
       to find someplace for Mister Spenalzo, too.
While talking, he has taken another sip from his bottle.

       JONATHAN
       Don't waste any worry on that rat.

Einstein stands up.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

       JONATHAN
       Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But, Johnny, we can't leave a dead body in the rumble seat.
       You shouldn't have killed him. Just because he knows
       something about us, what happens ?

Einstein mimes the breaking of a neck with his hands.

       JONATHAN
       We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down.
       Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That's your
       work, doctor. You did that to me.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, please, Johnny, take it easy. We'll find some place
       and I'll fix you up right away.

       JONATHAN
       Tonight.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

The two sisters are peeking in the room through a small
rectangular hole in the door of the kitchen.
       JONATHAN
       This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, Johnny. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

He comes close to Jonathan and shows him on his face what he is
going to do to it.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You see, I'm going to take this piece here and lift it
       up...

       JONATHAN
       Be careful about the stitches this time.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You leave that up to me. I'll give you nice little ears
       and...

       JONATHAN
       You were careless last time.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       And new stitches. And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt. That's
       my specialty. You see, I take it together like this...

       JONATHAN
       Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone.

The scene dissolves to :

JUDGE CULLMAN'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY.

The judge is sitting, studying some papers. Mortimer is standing
at his side.

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Poor Teddy. I imagine it's for the best.

He drops the papers on the desk and starts declaiming.

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Well... «Ours not to reason why, ours but to do...»

Mortimer is very irritated by the Judge's erratic attitude. He
puts a pen in his hand.

       MORTIMER
       Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there.

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic
       state...

Mortimer takes the pen from the Judge's hand and starts signing
the papers.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign
       here as next of kin, don't I ?

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Only last week I created a mild sensation at the Bar
       Association, when I said...

Mortimer dries the document, and shakes the Judge's hand.

       MORTIMER
       Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

He walks to the door of the office.

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week. I've been
       feeling rather lonely.

Mortimer comes back on his steps.

       MORTIMER
       No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely.
       Never !
       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Why, I... I... I...

Mortimer comes back to the Judge's desk.

       MORTIMER
       Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ?

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Why, no. I never indulge.

       MORTIMER
       Good ! Then you'll live longer.

He goes back to the door.

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       Of course a little wine now...

       MORTIMER
       No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine !

He goes out, slamming the door behind him. The Judge looks
pensively at the door Mortimer just closed.

       JUDGE CULLMAN
       I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

The scene dissolves to :

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The Brewster sister are sitting at the table with Doctor Einstein
and Jonathan. The dinner is finished, and both men are smoking.

       ABBY
       Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're
       going.

The two sisters stands up from the table.

       JONATHAN
       My dear, sweet aunties, I'm so full of your delicious
       dinner I'm unable to move a muscle.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, it's nice here.

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony. He is still wearing
his colonial costume. He has a book in his hand and a spare pith
helmet under his arm. He rushes down the stairs.

       TEDDY
       I found it ! I found it !

He stops suddenly in the staircase.

       TEDDY
       Gentlemen, be seated.
Jonathan and Einstein pretend they are standing up, but they
immediately sit back in their chairs.

Teddy comes down the last steps and goes toward the table.

       TEDDY
       Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography.

He puts the book on the table, in front of Einstein. It's open on
a page with a picture.

       TEDDY
       Here's the picture I was telling you about, General. Here
       we are, both of us. President Roosevelt and General
       Goethals at Culebra Cut. That's me, General, and that's
       you.

Einstein looks at the picture.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       My, how I've changed !

       TEDDY
       Well, you see, that picture hasn't been taken yet. We
       haven't even started work on Culebra Cut. We're still
       digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama
       and inspect the new lock.

He gives the spare helmet to Einstein.

       ABBY
       No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Oh, maybe some other time, Mister President. Panama is a
       long ways off.
       TEDDY
       Nonsense ! It's just down in the cellar.

Jonathan, who hadn't seemed to be much interested by Teddy's
conversation, suddenly looks up.

       JONATHAN
       The cellar ?

       MARTHA
       Well, we let him dig the Panama Canal in the cellar.

       TEDDY
       General Goethals ?

Einstein slightly raises the hand holding the cigarette to his
forehead.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, sir.

       TEDDY
       As President of the United States, Commander in Chief of
       the Army and Navy, and the man who gave you this job, I
       demand that you accompany me on the inspection of the new
       lock.

       JONATHAN
       Teddy ! I think it's time for you to go to bed.

       TEDDY
       I beg your pardon. Who are you ?

       JONATHAN
       I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

       TEDDY
       No, you're not Wilson. But your face is familiar. Let me
       see... You're not anyone I know now. Perhaps later, on my
       hunting trip to Africa. Yes, you look like someone I might
       meet in the jungle.

Jonathan starts standing up with a very menacing face.

       ABBY
       I think, perhaps, you had better go to bed, Teddy. He and
       his friend want to get back to their hotel.

Jonathan sits back in his chair.

       JONATHAN
       General Goethals, inspect the canal.

Einstein stands up and takes his helmet.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       All right, Mister President, we go to Panama.

       TEDDY
       Bully, bully ! Follow me, General.
He opens the door to the cellar, then turns toward Einstein, taps
on the helmet Einstein is carrying and then on his own helmet.

       TEDDY
       It's down south, you know.

Einstein puts the helmet on his head. The helmet is too large for
him, and gets down on his eyes.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Oh !

Teddy starts going downstairs. Before following him, Einstein
turns around to the others.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Well, bon voyage !

He waves them goodbye and then follows Teddy downstairs.

Jonathan has remained seated, with both his aunts standing on the
other side of the table.

       JONATHAN
       Aunt Abby, I must correct your misapprehension. You talked
       of our hotel. We have no hotel. We came here directly.

       ABBY
       This is not your home, and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

Jonathan stands up and looks menacingly at his aunts. While
talking, he moves closer to them. They look frightened.

       JONATHAN
       Doctor Einstein and I need a place to sleep. You remember
       that, as a boy, I could be disagreeable. It would not be
       pleasant for any of us if... but I don't have to go into
       details, do I ?

       MARTHA
       Perhaps we'd better let them stay here tonight.

Einstein appears at the door of the cellar.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny, Johnny. Come here. Quick.

He goes back down the stairs to the cellar.

       JONATHAN
       Oh, I forgot to tell you, Doctor Einstein and I are turning
       Grandfather's laboratory into an operating room. We expect
       to be very busy.

He goes to the cellar door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein is on the staircase, halfway down to the cellar. On the
wall behind him, we see the shadow of Teddy digging.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny, down here, what do you think I find ?

He takes off his helmet. Jonathan joins him on the stairs.

       JONATHAN
       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       The Panama Canal. And it just fits Mister Spenalzo. See the
       hole he's digging. Four feet wide, six feet long. He just
       fits ! You'd think he knew we were bringing Mister Spenalzo
       along. That's hospitality.

Jonathan smiles and looks upstairs.

       JONATHAN
       Rather a good joke on my aunts. They're living in a house
       with a body buried in the cellar.
Einstein laughs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, how do we get him in here ?

       JONATHAN
       Yes, we can't just walk Mister Spenalzo in through the
       door. We'll bring the car up between the cemetery and the
       house, and after they've gone to bed, we'll bring Mister
       Spenalzo in through the window.

He goes back up the stairs. Einstein follows him. The shadow of
Teddy keeps on digging.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny...

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Jonathan comes in through the cellar door, with Einstein following
behind him. His two aunts are still standing up in the room.

       JONATHAN
       We're moving the car behind the house. You'd better get to
       bed.

He crosses the room with Einstein following him.

       MARTHA
       The car is all right where it is until morning.

       JONATHAN
       I don't want to leave it in the street. That might be
       against the law.

He opens the front door, and gets out, still followed by Einstein.

       MARTHA
       Abby ! What are we going to do ?

       ABBY
       Well, we're not going to let them spend more than one night
       in this house, for one thing. But what would the neighbors
       think ? People coming in here with one face and going out
       with another.

       MARTHA
       And what are we going to do about Mister Hoskins ?

       ABBY
       Oh ! Mister Hoskins ! It can't be very comfortable for him
       in there. And he's been so patient, the poor dear. Well, I
       think Teddy had better take Mister Hoskins downstairs right
       away.

Teddy enters by the cellar door.

       TEDDY
       General Goethals was very pleased. He said the canal was
       just the right size.
From the table, he picks up the book he had shown to Dr. Einstein,
and starts looking at it.

       ABBY
       Teddy ! Teddy, there's been another yellow-fever victim.

       TEDDY
       Dear me ! This will be a shock to the General.

       ABBY
       No, Teddy, we must keep it a secret.

       MARTHA
       Yeah !

       TEDDY
       A state secret ?

       ABBY
       Yes, a state secret.

       MARTHA
       Promised ?

       TEDDY
       You have the word of the President of the United States.
       Cross my heart and hope to die.

He crosses his chest and spits on the floor. Then, he takes his
aunts in his arms.

       TEDDY
       Now, let's see. How are we going to keep it a secret ?

       ABBY
       Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the
       cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when
       everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man
       down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy.

Teddy crosses the room to the cellar door.

       ABBY
       And we'll come down later and hold services.

Teddy opens the door, and turns around.

       TEDDY
       Where is the poor devil ?

       ABBY
       (voice over)
       In the window-seat.

       TEDDY
       It seems to be spreading. We've never had yellow fever
       there before.

       MARTHA
       Abby. I've never even seen Mister Hoskins !

       ABBY
       Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just
       come right along and see him now. You know, he's really
       very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist.

Both sisters go to the window-seat and are ready to lift the lid,
when the drapes above the seat suddenly open wide, revealing a
very menacing Jonathan. The two sisters back off, frightened.

Jonathan slowly climbs in through the window, and stands up on the
window-seat.

       JONATHAN
       We're bringing the luggage through here.

He gets down from the window-seat. Then Einstein appears behind
the window, carrying a suitcase. Jonathan helps him to bring the
suitcase in the room.

       ABBY
       Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right
       up.

Einstein, still outside the window, gives Jonathan another
suitcase.

       JONATHAN
       I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along
       to bed.

       ABBY
       Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't
       go to bed this early.

       JONATHAN
       It's time I came home to take care of you.
Behind Jonathan, Einstein has come into the room and is closing
the window, and then the drapes.

       JONATHAN
       (to Einstein)
       Take the bags upstairs.

Einstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       For the instruments, I'll come back later.

       ABBY
       Good night.

Einstein slightly bows to Abby.

       JONATHAN
       Now, we'll all go to bed.

       ABBY
       I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights.

Einstein has already almost reached the balcony. Martha starts
climbing, with Jonathan behind her.

       JONATHAN
       Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

Everybody reaches the balcony. Einstein disappears at the end of
the balcony, and Martha enters her room. Jonathan turns around and
looks down at Abby.

       JONATHAN
       All right, Aunt Abby.

       ABBY
       I'll be right up.

       JONATHAN
       Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights.

Abby goes to the switch near the front door, and switches the
lights off. The room is completely dark.

Abby climbs the stairs, reaches the balcony, and walks slowly pass
Jonathan, who is still standing at the same place. Then, she
quickly enters the room she shares with her sister, who is holding
the door open for her.

Jonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to
the upper floor. He stops after a few steps, and sees the door of
his aunts' room opening slowly. Abby comes out.

       JONATHAN
       Aunt Abby.

Abby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door. Jonathan
resumes his climbing.
The camera moves down into total black darkness, and then into the
room, where we see some light underneath the cellar door. We hear
steps, and the door opens to reveal Teddy, still in his colonial
costume, but without the helmet. He stops a few seconds, then
starts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath
the kitchen door. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking, and
we guess Teddy has just opened it. Shuffling noises. Then we see
the shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy. We hear
the cat screaming, and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its
tail. When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the
cellar, we discover he is carrying a human body, which could only
be Mr. Hoskins' one taken from the window-seat. Teddy turns around
and starts going backward down the steps to the cellar. He stops a
few seconds to close the door. Then we hear noises of something
falling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and
fallen all the way down to the cellar.

Black screen during one second.

Einstein is going down the staircase, lit only by a match he is
holding in his hand.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       He's all right, Johnny.

When he gets on floor level, he meets Jonathan.

       JONATHAN
       I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But he's too heavy for me.

He burns his finger and blows the match. The scene becomes
completely dark. We see only shadows.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and
       pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ?

       JONATHAN
       All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around
       outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the
       window.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah.

Jonathan moves to the front door, opens it, stops to look around,
and then closes the door.

Einstein walks slowly in the room.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       It's dark in here.

He bumps into something. We hear the lid of the window-seat
creaking several times.
Einstein light another match, and we discover he has fallen into
the open window-seat, where he is now lying

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Where am I ? Oh, here I am.

He slowly gets out of the seat.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Who left this open ?

Jonathan taps on the window. Einstein blows the match and opens
the window.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Johnny ?

We see only shadows in the dark, but we guess Jonathan is handing
Mr. Spenalzo's corpse to Einstein, who will then put it in the
window-seat.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him.
       «Allez !» Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg
       somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now
       I got him.

       JONATHAN
       Be careful.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.
       Now I've got him !

Knocking at the door.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.
       I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick !

Some more knocking. We hear the creaking of the lid of the window-
seat, and we guess Einstein is closing it.

The front door opens slowly, and Elaine enters the house.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer ! Aunt Abby !

We see the frightened face of Einstein.

       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       Aunt Martha !

Jonathan enters through the front door left open by Elaine, closes
it and locks it.

       ELAINE
       (looking frightened)
       Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ?
       JONATHAN
       Who are you ?

       ELAINE
       I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

       JONATHAN
       What are you doing here ?

       ELAINE
       I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.

       JONATHAN
       Why did you say your name was Harper ?

       ELAINE
       Well, it is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very
       used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster.

Einstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on.
       JONATHAN
       Doctor !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       It's all right, Johnny. It's okay.

Einstein has his little bottle in one hand, and, with the finger
of the other hand, he tries to explain to Jonathan that the corpse
is safely in the window-seat.

Jonathan looks at Einstein, and then goes across the room to look
around. He even moves the drapes of a window to look outside.

       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here.

Jonathan keeps on checking around. He goes to the window above the
window-seat, and looks outside.

       JONATHAN
       We happen to live here.

He spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up.

       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and
       I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss
       Abby ? What have you done to them ?

Einstein tries to explain to Jonathan, without using words, that
the shoe belongs to the corpse in the window-seat.

       JONATHAN
       Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present
       Doctor Einstein ?
He puts the shoe on the table, then lifts the tablecloth to look
underneath it.

       ELAINE
       Doctor Einstein ?

       JONATHAN
       A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a
       magician.

       ELAINE
       Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris...

       JONATHAN
       (cutting her very harshly)
       I am Jonathan Brewster.

       ELAINE
       Oh ! You're Jonathan.

Jonathan comes close to her and looks at her in such a strange way
that she starts walking backward.
       JONATHAN
       You've heard of me ?

       ELAINE
       Yes, they talk about you.

       JONATHAN
       What do they say about me ?

Elaine stops walking backward.

       ELAINE
       Oh, just that there's another brother named Jonathan,
       that's all they say. Oh, that explains everything. Now that
       I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll
       kindly unlock the door.

They move to the front door, beside which Einstein is standing,
smiling. Jonathan unlocks the door. He opens it a few inches, but
stands in the way of Elaine, ready to got out.

       JONATHAN
       «That explains everything.» Just what do you mean by that ?
       Why do you come here at this time of night ?

       ELAINE
       Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up. I suppose it
       was you.

Jonathan slams the door and locks it.

       JONATHAN
       You thought you saw someone drive up ?

He walks menacingly toward her, and she starts walking backward
across the room.
       ELAINE
       Yes. Weren't you just outside ? Isn't that your car ?

       JONATHAN
       You saw someone at the car ?

       ELAINE
       Yes.

Einstein starts walking behind Jonathan.

       JONATHAN
       What else did you see ?

       ELAINE
       Oh, just that, that's all !

       JONATHAN
       I see. Is that why you came over here ?

       ELAINE
       Oh no, I came to see Mortimer. But if he's not home, I'll
       run...

She tries to run away, but Jonathan grabs her arms and holds it
very firmly.

       JONATHAN
       You've given two names.

       ELAINE
       You're hurting me !

       JONATHAN
       I think she's dangerous.

Teddy comes in through the cellar door. He has his helmet back on
his head and wears heavy working gloves.

       TEDDY
       No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral.

He crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs. Both Jonathan
and Einstein are now holding Elaine.

       ELAINE
       Teddy ! Teddy, tell these men who I am !

Teddy stops a few steps from floor level.

       TEDDY
       Oh, that's my daughter, Alice.

       ELAINE
       Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy !

       TEDDY
       Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the
       gentlemen.
He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs.

       TEDDY
       Charge !

He rushes into his room and slams the door.

       ELAINE
       Teddy !

Elaine starts screaming. Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her
mouth. Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights
off.

       JONATHAN
       Doctor, the cellar.

       ELAINE
       Let go of me ! Let go of me !

The cellar door is opened, and we see the shadows of the two men
dragging Elaine down to the cellar.
       MARTHA
       What's the matter ? What's happening down there ?

The lights are switched back on, and we see Abby and Martha on the
balcony, just coming out of their room. They are both dressed in
black funeral clothes.

       ABBY
       What's the matter ? What are you doing there ?

Jonathan is coming alone out of the cellar.

       JONATHAN
       We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room.

       ABBY
       We'll call the police.

She starts going down the stairs, followed by Martha.

       JONATHAN
       I'll handle this. Go back to your room.

Abby stops at the top of the stairs.

       JONATHAN
       Do you hear me ?

Knocking on the door, followed by the doorbell. The two sisters
starts going down the stairs.

       JONATHAN
       Don't answer that.

Another doorbell. The two sisters are running downstairs.

       JONATHAN
       Don't answer that !

Elaine rushes through the cellar door, screaming. She runs into
Martha's arms, followed by Einstein.

       ELAINE
       Let go of me !

More knocking and ringing at the door. Abby goes and opens the
door. Mortimer enters the house..

       MORTIMER
       Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ?

Elaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck. He gets rid
of her.

       MORTIMER
       Never mind that now, darling, please.

He starts climbing the stairs and looks, surprised, at Martha.
       MORTIMER
       What are you doing with your best clothes on ?

He suddenly notices Jonathan's presence and stops mounting the
stairs.

       MORTIMER
       Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks
       like a cigar-store dummy ?

       ABBY
       It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein.

       MORTIMER
       Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the
       house ? Who did you say it was ?

       ABBY
       It's your brother, Jonathan !

Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat, and starts talking to him. So do
Abby and Martha on either side of him. Since the three of them are
talking together, it is impossible to understand what they say.

       JONATHAN
       I've come back home, Mortimer.

At the voice of Jonathan, the three women stop talking

       MORTIMER
       What ?

       JONATHAN
       I've come back home, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       «I've come back home, Mortimer.» Listen, it talks !
       JONATHAN
       Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used
       to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The
       needles under your fingernails.

Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer, he...

       MORTIMER
       Wait a minute.

Mortimer walks closer to Jonathan.

       MORTIMER
       Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan !

       JONATHAN
       I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get
       that face ? Hollywood ?

Jonathan is ready to fight with his brother. Einstein grabs his
arm to stop him and Abby comes between them.

       ABBY
       Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute
       you've seen each other.

       MARTHA
       We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay.

       MORTIMER
       What ?

       MARTHA
       Just for tonight.

       MORTIMER
       Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm
       staying here from now on.

Elaine taps on Mortimer's arm.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer, what about me ?

       MORTIMER
       There's no room for anybody else in the house.
       (to Elaine)
       Please, darling, just a moment.
       (to Jonathan)
       So take that little squirt and beat it !
       (to Martha)
       Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he
       upstairs ?
He starts climbing the stairs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can
       sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       Nothing to...

He stops going upstairs

       MORTIMER
       Window-seat ?

He comes back downstairs.

       MORTIMER
       Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the
       window-seat.

He crosses the room to sit on the window-seat.
       MORTIMER
       I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer !

Mortimer stands up and goes to Jonathan

       MORTIMER
       Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's
       ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel.

Jonathan throws Mortimer's money on the floor. Mortimer tries to
step on it, but instead, he steps on Jonathan's foot.

       JONATHAN
       Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around.

Einstein pulls Jonathan's sleeve.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny. Mister Spenalzo.

Mortimer bends down to look at Jonathan foot, then he touches his
legs.

       JONATHAN
       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       What's going to happen to Mister Spenalzo ?

Mortimer takes a fork on the table and stabs Jonathan's leg with
it.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       We can't leave him here in the window-seat. Johnny ?
       JONATHAN
       Doctor, you know, Doctor, I've completely lost track of
       Mister Spenalzo.

       MORTIMER
       Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

       MORTIMER
       Don't you bring anyone else in here. Now, come on, beat it,
       both of you !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       It's all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I'll tell you
       about him.

Jonathan walks to the staircase, and starts going upstairs,
followed by Einstein. He stops a few steps before he reaches the
balcony.
       JONATHAN
       I'll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while.

He resumes his walking upstairs.

       MORTIMER
       How do you like that ? The guy stays away for twenty years
       and picks tonight of all nights to come back. Oh, Elaine,
       what are you doing here ?

She falls in his arms.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer !

       MORTIMER
       What's the matter, darling ?

       ELAINE
       I almost got killed.

       MORTIMER
       Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !

       ABBY
       Oh, no !

       MARTHA
       Oh, no ! It was Jonathan !

       ABBY
       He mistook her for a sneak thief.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, that.

Martha just found the shoe on the table and seems very intrigued
by it.
       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       It was worse than that. He's some kind of a maniac.

Abby looks at the shoe, and seems also very intrigued. Martha
whispers something to her.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       I know, darling, I know.

       ELAINE
       (voice over)
       Oh, Mortimer, I'm afraid of him.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget
       it.

Abby whispers back to Martha, who puts the shoe back on the table.
The two sisters move away.

       ELAINE
       We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls in
       a barrel, your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi's
       waiting, and now you want to sleep on a window-seat !

Mortimer hardly listens to her, but catches the last word.

       MORTIMER
       Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along
       home.

       ELAINE
       What ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do.

He sits at the desk and starts dialing on the telephone.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer ? But... but...

       MORTIMER
       No, no, please.
       (in the phone)
       Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

       ELAINE
       But, Mortimer, didn't you hear what I was just saying ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes, 2-7-0.

       ELAINE
       Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me !
       MORTIMER
       Please ! This is important !

       ELAINE
       That ?

       MORTIMER
       Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer
       Brewster.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Witherspoon is sitting behind his desk, the telephone receiver to
his ear.

       WITHERSPOON
       Yes, Mr. Brewster, yes.

He puts an effervescent pill in a glass of water.

       WITHERSPOON
       Well, I don't understand you.
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine is crying, standing near the desk, where Mortimer is still
on the telephone.

       MORTIMER
       (in the phone)
       Look, look, I...

He raises his head to look at Elaine

       ELAINE
       He was going to kill me !

       MORTIMER
       (to Elaine)
       Wait a minute, I can't hear the man.
       (to Witherspoon on the phone)
       What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late,
       but I want you to come down here and get my brother
       immediately ! I's got to be done.
       (to Elaine)
       Please, darling, please.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

       WITHERSPOON
       By the way, you've had the papers signed by your brother
       and the doctor, of course ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer seems surprised by the question.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor !
Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his
jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his
side.
        ELAINE
        Mortimer !

       MORTIMER
       (yelling to Elaine)
       Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ?
       (to Witherspoon on the phone)
       Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ?

       ELAINE
       You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi,
       your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them
       all over Niagara Falls !

She walks away

       MORTIMER
       (to the departing Elaine)
       Thank you, darling. Thank you.
       (to Witherspoon on the phone)
       Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While
       you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's
       signatures both.

The front door slams violently. Mortimer turns around.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine !
       (to Witherspoon)
       Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right
       away.

He puts the phone down.

       MORTIMER
       Elaine ? What's the matter with her ?

He stands up and runs across the room to the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, dear !

He kneels on the window-seat and looks through the open window.

       MORTIMER
       Elaine ! Elaine !

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Large shot of Reverend Harper's residence. Elaine enters the front
door, and slams the door behind her.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is still looking through the open window.

       MORTIMER
       Elaine !

He enters back into the room, and sits on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       (whispering to himself)
       Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor,
       Teddy, signature...

He looks at the seat.

       MORTIMER
       Hoskins !

He remains seated a few seconds in deep thought, then he gives a
quick look outside the window, stands up and starts lifting the
lid. The lid creaks. Mortimer seems very surprised by what he sees
inside the seat. He opens the lid completely and let it rest on
the bottom of the window.

       MORTIMER
       Ye gods ! There's another one !
He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen
door.

       MORTIMER
       Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here !

       ABBY
       (voice over from the kitchen)
       We're busy.

       MORTIMER
       No, you come in here now !

Abby, still in funeral clothes, enters the room through the
kitchen door.

       ABBY
       Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ?

       MORTIMER
       Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in
       the house while I was gone ?

       ABBY
       Jonathan just walked in.

       MORTIMER
       I don't mean Jonathan !

       ABBY
       And Doctor...

       MORTIMER
       And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the
       window-seat ?

       ABBY
       We told you. Mister Hoskins.

       MORTIMER
       He is not Mister Hoskins !

He opens the window-seat wide and let the lid rest on the bottom
of the window.

       MORTIMER
       There !

Abby walks to the window-seat and looks inside, surprised.

       ABBY
       Who can that be ?

       MORTIMER
       You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man
       before ?

       ABBY
       I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's
       getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house !

       MORTIMER
       Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of
       this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know
       it !

       ABBY
       Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an
       impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar,
       he's mistaken.

       MORTIMER
       You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window-
       seat.

       ABBY
       Yes, I did.

       MORTIMER
       Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister
       Hoskins !

       ABBY
       Oh, no.

       MORTIMER
       By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ?

Mortimer starts looking around the room.

       ABBY
       He must have gone to Panama.

       MORTIMER
       What ? You buried him ?

       ABBY
       No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the
       services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with
       Jonathan in the house.

Mortimer suddenly realizes the corpse could be a «friend» of
Jonathan. He quickly closes the lid.

       ABBY
       Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral.
       But I will not read services over a total stranger !

She walks back to the kitchen. Mortimer catches her.

       MORTIMER
       A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There
       are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned
       them !

       ABBY
       Yes, I did. But you don't think I'd stoop to telling a
       fib ! Martha !
She enters the kitchen.

       ABBY
       Martha ! Martha ! What do you think has happened ?

       MORTIMER
       «A fib !»

Mortimer starts dancing around the room. Then he hears a door
closing on the balcony, and he sits on the window-seat. We see
Jonathan on the balcony. He starts going downstairs. Mortimer goes
toward him.

       MORTIMER
       Jon... Oh-oh... Ah-ah...

       JONATHAN
       This may interest you, Mortimer. I've decided that we're
       staying. And I've also decided that you're leaving, and I
       mean now.

       MORTIMER
       Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question.
       Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear?

       JONATHAN
       I've led a strange life, Mortimer.

Abby comes in through the kitchen door, followed by Martha.

       ABBY
       Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see
       what's in that window-seat.

Jonathan and Mortimer both rushes across the room and sit on the
window-seat

       MORTIMER
       No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't...

He stops when he realizes that Jonathan is sitting with him. He
suddenly understands the situation, and shows a broad smile to his
brother. He then stands up

       MORTIMER
       Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat.

Jonathan's face shows that he is no more so sure of himself.

       MORTIMER
       Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

He kisses her on the forehead.

       MORTIMER
       I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving.
       And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion
       with him.
       (to Jonathan)
       Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So,
       I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence
       with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ?

Jonathan doesn't move from the window-seat.

       MORTIMER
       All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police.

He goes to the desk.

       JONATHAN
       Don't reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to
       Mister Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

Mortimer picks up the phone.

       MARTHA
       Spenalzo ?

       ABBY
       I knew he was a foreigner.

       JONATHAN
       Put down that telephone, Mortimer.

Jonathan puts his hand to his pocket, to take his gun. The
doorbell rings and we see a policeman's shadow through the frosted
glass. Jonathan stands up and Abby rushes to the door.

       ABBY
       Oh...

She opens the door on O'Hara. He is smiling and he's got his stick
in his hand.

       O'HARA
       Hello !
       ABBY
       Oh, Officer O'Hara !

       O'HARA
       I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness in the
       house...

       ABBY
       No...

He looks around.

       O'HARA
       Oh, you got company ? Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you.

He starts to walk back out, but Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER
       No ! Come in.

       ABBY
       Yes, do come in.
She closes the door behind him.

       MARTHA
       Come right in, Officer O'Hara. This is our nephew,
       Mortimer.

They shake hands, both smiling.

       O'HARA
       Oh, pleased to meet you.

       MORTIMER
       And glad to see you, fellow.

       ABBY
       And this is another nephew, Jonathan.

       O'HARA
       Pleased to make your acquaintance. Hey, your face is
       familiar. Haven't I seen a picture of you somewhere
       before ?

       JONATHAN
       I don't think so.

       O'HARA
       I'll be running along.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, come on. What's the hurry ? Why don't you stick around
       until my brother leaves.

       O'HARA
       I got to ring in, Mr. Brew... Say, you're not «the»
       Mortimer Brewster, the book-writer and the dramatic critic,
       are you ?
       MORTIMER
       Yes, why ?

       O'HARA
       Oh, what a break for me ! I'm a playwright.

       MORTIMER
       No ?

       O'HARA
       I'm working on a play now.

       MORTIMER
       You are ?

       O'HARA
       Yeah.

       MORTIMER
       Well, well, well ! Maybe I can help you with it.

       O'HARA
       Oh, would you ? Oh, what a break ! I get wonderful ideas,
       but I can't spell them.

       MORTIMER
       You can't ?... Oh, I can spell like the dickens.
       Constantinople ? Come on, come on, let's go into the
       kitchen.

       O'HARA
       All right.

       MORTIMER
       You can tell me all about it.
       (to Abby)
       Couldn't you whip up a sandwich for Officer O'Hara ?

       MARTHA
       I hope you don't mind eating in the kitchen, Officer
       O'Hara.

       O'HARA
       And where else would you eat ?

They all enter the kitchen, laughing, and leaving Jonathan alone
in the room. Mortimer lets them in, but comes back into the
sitting-room, closing the kitchen door behind him.

       MORTIMER
       (to the policeman and his aunts)
       See you in a moment.

He crosses the room toward Jonathan

       MORTIMER
       Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep
       O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get
       out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo.
       JONATHAN
       Mortimer...

       MORTIMER
       Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in
       Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo.

He opens the lid of the window-seat. But O'Hara comes into the
room and Mortimer quickly closes the lid.

       O'HARA
       Mister Brewster, my play takes place in...

Mortimer moves him back to the kitchen.

       MORTIMER
       I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with
       you. Just give me one moment.

Mortimer closes the door behind O'Hara and turns toward Jonathan.

       MORTIMER
       Now get going ! All three of you.

He enters the kitchen, and closes the door behind him. Einstein
arrives silently behind Jonathan and taps on this shoulder.
Jonathan turns quickly around. He then goes to the kitchen door
and comes back to Einstein.

       JONATHAN
       Doctor, this affair between my brother and myself has got
       to be settled.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But, Johnny, we've got trouble enough as it is. Come, let's
       go.

       JONATHAN
       We're not going. We're going to sleep right here in this
       house.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       What ? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the
       window-seat ?

       JONATHAN
       That's all he's got on us. We'll take Spenalzo and dump him
       in the bay. After that, we're coming back here. Then if he
       tries to interfere...

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, no, Johnny. No, please.

       JONATHAN
       Doctor, we've got a wonderful setup here. We can make a
       fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in
       our way. I never did like Mortimer.

He goes toward the kitchen door. Einstein catches up with him.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, Johnny, please, take it easy. Please !

       JONATHAN
       Doctor, you know when I make up my mind...

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah, I know, when you make up your mind, you lose your
       head. Look, Johnny, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

Jonathan takes Einstein's hand, twists it and brings Einstein down
on the floor.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Okay, Johnny. Okay !

Jonathan releases Einstein's hand, who stands up to massage his
hand.

       JONATHAN
       Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move
       fast.
Einstein takes the suitcase and walks to the cellar. Jonathan
opens the lid of the window-seat.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

In the kitchen, the Brewster sisters are moving around the room,
preparing food on the table. Both men are standing up near the
table. O'Hara, without his cap on his head, has a sandwich in his
hand.

       O'HARA
       Mister Brewster, you don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, I don't know.

O'Hara picks up a cup on the table.

       O'HARA
       No. My mother was an actress.

       MORTIMER
       Oh ? Legitimate ?

       O'HARA
       Of course she was. She was my mother.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, excuse me.

       O'HARA
       Peaches La Tour was her name.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door to the cellar is open. Einstein rushes up from the
cellar. He looks a bit frightened.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come quick !

Jonathan, who was looking down into the open window-seat, stands
up.

       JONATHAN
       What's the matter ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You know that hole in the cellar ?

       JONATHAN
       Yes.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Well, we got an ace in the hole.

Jonathan closes the window-seat, and walks toward the cellar.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
O'Hara is explaining something to Mortimer.

       O'HARA
       It's no fly-by-night idea. I've been working on this thing
       for twelve years.

Mortimer, who had just heard the creaking of the lid of the
window-seat, turns back toward the policeman.

       MORTIMER
       Well, you have ?

       O'HARA
       Yeah.

       MORTIMER
       Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute.

       O'HARA
       Oh, swell.

       MORTIMER
       I like the first act.

       O'HARA
       But I didn't tell you the first act, Mister Brew... I...

Before he can finish his sentence, Mortimer is already out of the
room.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer enters the empty sitting-room. He goes to the window-
seat, opens it and talks to the corpse.

       MORTIMER
       No, I thought I told you...
He closes the lid, kneels on the seat and looks through the open
window.

       MORTIMER
       Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan !

Jonathan enters from the cellar, followed by Einstein.

       JONATHAN
       Yes, Mortimer.

Mortimer turns around and looks, surprised, at his brother. Then
he comes into the room

       MORTIMER
       What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to
       beat it.

       JONATHAN
       We're not going.
       MORTIMER
       You're not going ?

       JONATHAN
       No.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No.

       MORTIMER
       You stay out of this. All right, you asked for it.

He goes to the kitchen door, which he opens slightly.

       MORTIMER
       Officer O'Hara ?

       O'HARA
       (voice over from the kitchen)
       Coming.

Mortimer comes back in the middle of the room.

       JONATHAN
       Now, if you tell O'Hara what's in the window-seat, I'll
       tell him what's down in the cellar.

       MORTIMER
       Cellar ?

       JONATHAN
       There's an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be
       very dead.

       MORTIMER
       What were you doing down the cellar ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But what is he doing in the cellar ?

       JONATHAN
       Now what are you going to tell O'Hara ?

O'Hara comes into the room from the kitchen.

       O'HARA
       Hey, your aunts heard my opening, it's swell. They want to
       hear the rest. Shall I bring them in here ?

He starts going back into the kitchen, but Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER
       No, no, no, no. You can't do that now. You'd better ring
       in.

       O'HARA
       Oh, the heck with ringing in ! You got me rolling now.
       I want to tell you the whole plot.

       MORTIMER
       You know, you can't tell me in front of those two fellas,
       they wouldn't appreciate it.

       O'HARA
       Huh ? Hey, lowbrows, huh ?

       MORTIMER
       Let's go some place we can be alone. I'll meet you there
       later.

O'Hara puts his cap back on his head.

       O'HARA
       Okay. Say ! How about the back room at Kelly's ?

       MORTIMER
       Kelly's ?

       O'HARA
       Yeah.

       MORTIMER
       Oh yeah, fine place for Bohemian atmosphere. Genius at
       work.

He escorts O'Hara to the front door.

       MORTIMER
       You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

       O'HARA
       Fine.

       MORTIMER
       Fine.

       JONATHAN
       Why don't you both go down in the cellar ?
       O'HARA
       That's all right with me.

O'Hara starts moving toward the cellar, but Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER
       No, no, no. There's a much more literary atmosphere in
       Kelly's, I assure you.

       O'HARA
       Okay.

       MORTIMER
       We'll meet later

       O'HARA
       This opening will kill you.

He opens the door and starts going out.

       MORTIMER
       You will.

       O'HARA
       I'm waiting to be born, you see, and the doctor comes in...

Mortimer, who was pushing O'Hara outside, suddenly slaps his
forehead with his hand.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, the doctor !

       O'HARA
       Yeah !

       MORTIMER
       Yeah. Now, Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

       O'HARA
       Okay. You won't stand me up, will you, Mister Brewster ?

       MORTIMER
       No.

       O'HARA
       This is a great play, you'll like it. I'll see you down
       there.

       MORTIMER
       Can't wait ! Can't wait !

Mortimer closes the door.

       MORTIMER
       Doctor, doctor. Where are those papers ? Oh, there they
       are.

He goes to the desk and picks up his papers. He then turns to
Jonathan and Einstein, still standing by the cellar door.
       MORTIMER
       Oh, oh-oh ! You're smug, aren't you? You think you've got
       it over me. But you haven't. You think I'm afraid to go to
       the police about Spenalzo because you've got hold of
       Hoskins. Well, I'm not !

He taps on his papers.

       MORTIMER
       The moment I get Spenalzo... I mean, the moment the doctor
       signs this, I don't care who knows about him, Hoskins, I
       mean. And you better feel the same way about Spenalzo. Yes,
       Spenalzo !

He starts running upstairs.

       JONATHAN
       Where are you going ?

       MORTIMER
       To the Doctor. Where do you... Oh !
Mortimer stops and starts running downstairs, and then to the
front door.

       MORTIMER
       When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me !

He goes out and closes the door. Einstein takes a sip at his
bottle.

       JONATHAN
       We'll wait for him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Did he look guilty !

The two sisters come out of the kitchen.

       ABBY
       Well, Martha, I think we can start the services now.

They stop when they see Jonathan and Einstein.

       ABBY
       Oh ! We thought we heard you leave.

       JONATHAN
       Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer.
       And speaking of services, Aunt Martha, will you make us
       some coffee while we take Mister Spenalzo down to the
       cellar ?

       MARTHA
       Oh, no. No, Jonathan. You've got to take him with you !

Jonathan opens the lid of the window-seat.

       JONATHAN
       There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs waiting for him.

       ABBY
       A friend of Mortimer's ?

       JONATHAN
       Take his feet, Doctor. Mister Spenalzo and he will get
       along fine together. They're both dead.

The two men bend down to take the corpse out of the window-seat.

       MARTHA
       Oh ! He must mean Mister Hoskins.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Mister Hoskins ?

The two men stand up and look at the sisters. Jonathan comes
closer to them.

       JONATHAN
       You know about what's down there ?
       ABBY
       Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one
       of our gentlemen.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Your gentlemen ?

       MARTHA
       Yes. And we won't have any strangers buried in our cellar.

       JONATHAN
       But Mister Hoskins ?

       MARTHA
       Mister Hoskins is no stranger.

       ABBY
       Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's
       crowded already.

       JONATHAN
       Crowded ? With what ?

       ABBY
       There are twelve graves down there now.

The two men look at each other. Jonathan seems the most surprised.

       JONATHAN
       Twelve graves.

       ABBY
       That leaves very little room and we're going to need it.

       JONATHAN
       You mean that you and Aunt Martha have murdered twelve...
       ABBY
       Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities.

       MARTHA
       Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.

       ABBY
       So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here.

They turn to Einstein, who has seated himself and is laughing his
head off.

       JONATHAN
       You've done all that right here in this house and buried
       them in the cellar ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       That's wonderful, Johnny !

He stands up.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       We've been chased all over the world, and they stay right
       here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do.

       JONATHAN
       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah. You got twelve, they got twelve.

Jonathan grabs Einstein by his shirt.

       JONATHAN
       I've got thirteen.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, Johnny, twelve. Don't brag.

       JONATHAN
       Thirteen.

They both starts counting on their fingers.

       JONATHAN
       There's Mister Spenalzo. Then the first one in London.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah.

       JONATHAN
       Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, two
       in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Phoenix ?

       JONATHAN
       The filling station.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Filling st... Oh, yes.

He mimes the gesture of one having his throat cut.

       JONATHAN
       Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes
       thirteen.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of
       pneumonia.

       JONATHAN
       He wouldn't have died of pneumonia if I hadn't shot him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, no, Johnny, you cannot count him. You got twelve, they
       got twelve. The old ladies is just as good as you are.

Both sisters seem very happy by Einstein's statement. They smile.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       They are, are they ? That's easily taken care of. All I
       need is one more. That's all. Just one more. And I've a
       pretty good idea who it is.

He looks menacingly at his two aunts, who do not smile anymore.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is walking along the gate of the churchyard, dragging Dr.
Gilchrist with him. Gilchrist is trying to tie his necktie while
walking. Apparently, Mortimer didn't let him dress completely when
he took him out of his home.

       MORTIMER
       I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor
       Gilchrist.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       This is most irregular, most irregular.

       MORTIMER
       I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see,
       you're the only one who can help me.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can't commit a man to an
       institution just on that.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure
       you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I...

They stop walking when they hear hymns sung by the Brewster
sisters.

       MORTIMER
       There goes Hoskins.
       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       Who ?

Mortimer looks embarrassed : he doesn't want to explain to the
doctor who Hoskins is.

       MORTIMER
       What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I...

He moves the doctor to the entrance of the churchyard.

       MORTIMER
       Now, you better wait.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       Here ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes, I'll bring Teddy out. Well, you see, I wouldn't want
       to alarm the old ladies, you know, seeing a doctor and
       everything. You wait here, huh ?
He helps him finish tying his necktie.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       In the cemetery ?

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, that'll be good.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       It's Halloween.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, don't worry about that. At Halloween, the pixies won't
       be out till after midnight. Now look, you wait here. Make
       yourself comfortable. Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right
       back.

He moves away to the house, and passes near the taxi, still
waiting.

       CAB DRIVER
       Hey, 22.50 !

       MORTIMER
       What ?

       CAB DRIVER
       22.50 !

       MORTIMER
       Oh, yes, looks good on you !

He hasn't stop walking, and goes into the house. The driver, who
had been following him, stops near the entrance of the house.

       CAB DRIVER
       Yeah ! Not the suit, the meter ! «Looks good on me.»
       22.50 !

A quick shot of Dr. Gilchrist waiting, frozen and slightly
frightened.

Then back on the entrance of the house, near which the driver is
still standing. Teddy and Mortimer come out of the house. Teddy is
back in his President Roosevelt costume.

       TEDDY
       Did you give him a twenty-one-gun salute ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

The driver catches up with them.

       CAB DRIVER
       Hey, you. Five more bucks and you'll own it.

Mortimer and Teddy don't stop walking. The driver follows them.
       MORTIMER
       Oh no, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

The two men reach the place where Dr. Gilchrist is waiting.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, Mister President, may I have the pleasure...

Teddy seems very happy to meet Dr. Gilchrist, and shakes his hands
vigorously.

       TEDDY
       Doctor Livingstone !

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       Livingstone ?

       MORTIMER
       (to the doctor)
       Well, that's what he presumes.
       (to Teddy)
       Mister President, the doctor would like to have a few words
       with you in private.

He bows slightly.

       TEDDY
       Certainly. Welcome to Washington, doctor.

He shakes his hand again, then puts his arm around the doctor's
shoulders and moves away with him into the churchyard.

       TEDDY
       Arlington is beautiful at this time of year, is it not,
       doctor ?

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       Yes, indeed.
The doctor looks back at Mortimer, seeming a little frightened.
Mortimer remains alone, with the papers in his hand. We still hear
the hymns sung by the Brewster sisters in the background.

       MORTIMER
       Well now, that's that. It gives me a chance to rest.

He sits down on a tombstone.

Reverse shot on Reverend Harper's house. Elaine opens the window
of her room.

Back to Mortimer seated on his tombstone. A little further behind
him, we see Teddy and the doctor talking.

       MORTIMER
       Well, so far, so good.

He stands up.

       MORTIMER
       Not so good.

He runs to Elaine's window.

The cab driver looks at the scene with intrigued eyes.

Mortimer is now outside Elaine's window.

       ELAINE
       Do you or do you not love me ?

       MORTIMER
       Oh, Elaine. Elaine, how can you say such a thing ? Darling,
       of course I love you.

       ELAINE
       Do you ?

Mortimer takes her in his arms.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, darling.

       ELAINE
       Hey, then why have you been treating me the way you have ?

       MORTIMER
       Oh, Elaine.

He moves slightly away from her.

       MORTIMER
       Elaine, Elaine, darling, I love you so much, I can't go
       through with our marriage.

She goes slightly back into her room.

       ELAINE
       Have you suddenly gone crazy ?

       MORTIMER
       No, no, I don't think so, but it's only a matter of time.
       Now, look, darling, you wouldn't want to have children
       with three heads, would you ? I mean, you wouldn't want to
       set up housekeeping in a padded cell.

       ELAINE
       What are you talking about ?

       MORTIMER
       Well, I don't quite know really. Look, I probably should
       have told you this before, but you see... well, insanity
       runs in my family.

We hear very clearly the Brewster sisters singing their hymns.

       MORTIMER
       It practically gallops.

       ELAINE
       Oh, darling, just because Teddy's a little strange, that
       doesn't mean...

       MORTIMER
       Oh no, darling, no, no. It's way back before Teddy. No,
       this goes back to the first Brewster, the one who came over
       on the Mayflower. Yeah. You know, you know how in those
       days the Indians used to scalp the settlers ? Well, he used
       to scalp the Indians.

Elaine bends out of her window to hug Mortimer.

       ELAINE
       Darling, that's ancient history.

Medium shot on the doctor and Teddy walking arm in arm among the
tombstones.

       TEDDY
       Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be
       elected. And that'll mean the last of the Roosevelts
       in the White House.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       That's what you think.

       TEDDY
       Of course, if the country insists...

Back to Elaine's room window. The young couple is still talking on
either side of the window.

       ELAINE
       Oh, darling, all this doesn't prove a thing. Look at your
       aunts. They're Brewsters, aren't they ? They're the
       sweetest, sanest people I've ever known.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah.

He turns around to listen to his aunts singing their hymns.

       MORTIMER
       Well, even they have their peculiarities.

       ELAINE
       What of it ? So your family's crazy. So you're crazy.
       That's the way I want you, the way I love you. I'm crazy
       too, but kiss me.

       MORTIMER
       No, no. I... Ohhh !

Mortimer hesitates a little and then gives a passionate kiss to
Elaine.

Back to Teddy and the doctor. Teddy is vigorously shaking the
doctor's hand.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       Goodbye, Ambassador. I've enjoyed this little talk very
       much. Anytime you're in Washington, drop in to see me at
       the White House.

He walks away, leaving the doctor very shaken by the experience.
The doctor runs to Mortimer, still outside Elaine's window and
kissing her passionately. The doctor clears loudly his throat to
attract Mortimer's attention.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       Those papers. Those papers.

       MORTIMER
       Go away.

Mortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes.

He pulls the papers from his jacket pocket, and gives them to the
doctor.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       I'll enjoy committing him to any place.

       MORTIMER
       You will ?

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST
       I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia !

       MORTIMER
       Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ?

Elaine suddenly slams her window down... on Mortimer's fingers !
Mortimer yells because of the pain. The doctor looks up from the
papers. Elaine also shut the inside shade down, shutting the room
completely from the outside world.

       MORTIMER
       No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers.
       Oh dear. Thank you.

Mortimer blows on his hurt fingers, then grabs the papers from the
doctor and runs away.

       MORTIMER
       Okay, thank you.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the empty window-seat, where just remains Mr.
Spenalzo's hat.

From the open cellar door, Martha is coming out, followed by Abby.
They are still dressed in their funeral clothes.

       ABBY
       All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this
       is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use
       doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be
       undone.

       JONATHAN
       (voice over from the cellar)
       Aunt Abby, go to bed !

       ABBY
       It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a
       foreigner.

Mortimer comes rushing into the room with the papers in his hand.

       MORTIMER
       Hello.

He blows on the papers to dry the ink of the signature.

       ABBY
       Mortimer, where have you been ?

Mortimer starts running upstairs.

       MORTIMER
       Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in
       his room ?

       MARTHA
       Oh, Mortimer, what is the matter with you ? Running around
       getting papers signed at a time like this.

       ABBY
       Martha and I are going for the police.

       MORTIMER
       Police !
He quickly get back downstairs

       MORTIMER
       Oh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police.

       MARTHA
       Oh, no ? You know what Jonathan's doing ?

       ABBY
       He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in
       together.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, darling, let him.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein just finished working, and he is cleaning the bottom of
his pants. We notice he is wearing Mr. Spenalzo's shoes. A shovel
is resting on the wall near him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake.
       The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal.

He stretches himself

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Oh, Johnny, bed feels good already. You know, we didn't get
       any sleep for forty-eight hours.

Jonathan walks behind him, carrying a shovel. He puts the shovel
down against the wall and start mounting the stairs

       JONATHAN
       You're forgetting, Doctor.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       What ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is trying to calm his aunts down

       ABBY
       Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this
       house before morning, we're going for the police.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that !

       ABBY
       Then you get the wedding silver.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, but remember, no police ! No police ! All right.

He starts mounting the stairs.

       MORTIMER
       There's a thing. Look, go to bed, will you ? Fine. Get out
       of those clothes ! You two look like a double blackout.

He reaches the balcony.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Jonathan is standing on the bottom of the cellar staircase.

       JONATHAN
       My brother, Mortimer.

He goes back down in the cellar toward Einstein, who has his
bottle in his hand.

       JONATHAN
       I just heard him upstairs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, no, no ! I am tired. You forget, I got to operate on
       your face tomorrow.
He sits down on the bottom steps of the stairs.

       JONATHAN
       (voice over. We just see his shadow on the wall behind
       Einstein)
       You are going to operate tomorrow, Doctor. But tonight we
       are taking care of Mortimer.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, but Johnny, not tonight ! I'm sleepy. We'll do it
       tomorrow. Or the next day.

       JONATHAN
       (voice over from the shadow on the wall)
       Look at me, Doctor. You can see that it's got to be done,
       can't you?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah, I know that look.

       JONATHAN
       (voice over from the shadow on the wall)
       It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Okay, okay, Johnny, okay. We'll do it. But the quick way,
       huh ? The quick twist like in London.

He mimes the breaking of a neck with his fingers, and then takes a
sip from his bottle

       JONATHAN
       (voice over from the shadow on the wall)
       No, Doctor. I think this calls for something special. I
       think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Not the Melbourne method, please ! Two hours ! And then
       when it was all over, what ? The fellow in London was just
       as dead as the fellow in Melbourne.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony, in his President
Roosevelt costume. He takes his bugle to his mouth, ready to play
it. Mortimer comes out of the room and lowers the bugle.

       MORTIMER
       No, no, no. Don't do that, Mister President.

       TEDDY
       But I cannot sign any proclamation without consulting my
       Cabinet.

Mortimer puts the papers in front of his eyes.

       MORTIMER
       This must be secret.

Teddy takes the papers and looks at them.
       TEDDY
       A secret proclamation ? How unusual.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, it's the only way we can outsmart the other fellow.

       TEDDY
       Who's the other fellow ?

       MORTIMER
       That's the secret.

       TEDDY
       Oh, I see ! Very clever. Well, if it's a a secret
       proclamation, it has to be signed in secret.

He folds the papers.

       MORTIMER
       Of course, Mister President.

       TEDDY
       I'll have to put on my signing clothes.

He starts to move back to his room. Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, you already have them on, Mister President.

Teddy looks at his costume.

       TEDDY
       So I have. Wait here.

He goes back into his room and closes the door. Einstein appears
at the bottom of the stairs.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Mister Brewster.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, what is it ? Mice ?

Einstein climbs the stairs very rapidly. He takes Mortimer by the
sleeve and whispers to him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Mister Brewster, you get out of this house.

       MORTIMER
       Can't you see I'm busy ?

He tries to get rid of Einstein's hand on his sleeve.

We hear the bugle playing the first notes of Beethoven's fifth
symphony.

       MORTIMER
       (singing the same tune)
       Ta-ta-ta taaa !

He knocks on Teddy's door. The papers are slid under the door.
Mortimer bends down to pick them up.

       MORTIMER
       Thank you, Mister President. Oh, what a load off my mind.
       Boy, could I use a drink ! Thank God for that.

He starts going downstairs. Einstein follows him and takes his
sleeve again.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       (whispering)
       Get out of here, will you, please ?

       MORTIMER
       Huh ? What did you say ? Speak up, sonny. I can't hear you.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       (still whispering)
       Johnny's in a bad mood. You get out of here !

       MORTIMER
       Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Please listen to me. Get out.

Mortimer gets rid of Einstein's hands on his sleeves.

       MORTIMER
       Stop all this ! What are you doing ? Look, Doc. Are you
       really a doctor ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, Heidelberg, 1919. You go...
He takes his sleeve again and tries to move him to the front door.

       MORTIMER
       Heidelberg ? How'd you... How'd you come to hook up with
       Jonathan ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       I tell you later about that, but you go now. Please listen
       to me.

They've reached the front door. Mortimer takes Einstein's hand out
of his sleeve.

       MORTIMER
       Tch-tch-tch ! Stop it, Doctor, now stop it !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You get out of here ! Look, look, when Johnny's in that
       mood, he's a madman. He's a maniac ! And then things
       happen. Horrible things.

He mimes the cutting of his own throat, and takes Mortimer's hand
to throw him out.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You get out of here !

       MORTIMER
       Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about
       Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of
       yourself. Now, get going, little fellow.

He opens the door to throw him out. He pats him on the behind to
move him, and discover the shape of the bottle under his hand.

       MORTIMER
       What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute.

He takes the bottle out of Einstein's pocket

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Oh no ! My schnapps !

       MORTIMER
       I could use that. I could use that.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       That's mine.

He tries to get his bottle back, but Mortimer holds on it.

       MORTIMER
       Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it
       before things start popping around here.

He moves away to the table, with the bottle in his hand. Einstein
joins his hand in a praying gesture.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You've just been married.
       You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now.
       Please.

Mortimer pours some of the schnapps in a glass.

Einstein slams the front door with a very nervous punch, and walks
toward Mortimer. He mumbles incomprehensible words, probably in
German.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Tell me, don't those plays you see all the time teach you
       anything ?

Mortimer is drinking. He lowers his glass.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've
       got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister
       Witherspoon.

He looks at his watch.
       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       At least people in plays act like they got sense.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever
       act like they got intelligence ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       How can somebody be so stupid ?

       MORTIMER
       You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me,
       brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself
       wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a
       play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be
       running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man...
       Now listen to this...

Behind Mortimer, the cellar door opens silently and Jonathan
enters slowly into the room, without Mortimer noticing him.

       MORTIMER
       Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought
       to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of
       the house. And does he go ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes.

       MORTIMER
       No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have
       sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The
       murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he
       does ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Well, I don't know.
       MORTIMER
       He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately
       pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it.

Mortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it. He puts
his glass on the table.

       MORTIMER
       Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be
       trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss
       him up with ?

He keeps on laughing while talking.

Close-up of Jonathan's face, smiling.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       (voice over)
       Oh, what ?

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       The curtain cord.

Jonathan looks in the direction of the window... and the curtain
cord.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ?

Behind the seated Mortimer, Jonathan is silently walking to the
window.

       MORTIMER
       Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his
       back toward the murderer.

Mortimer turns slightly on his chair, but without taking his eyes
off Einstein, and, of course, without looking at his brother
behind him, quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife.

       MORTIMER
       All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No !

Medium shot on Jonathan cutting the curtain cords.

       MORTIMER
       (voice over)
       No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even
       in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or
       hears anything. No. That's right.

Jonathan folds the jack-knife and puts it in his pocket. He
prepares the cords he has just cut. Einstein takes a napkin on the
table.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But what does he do ?

       MORTIMER
       Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This
       fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there.

Jonathan is now just behind Mortimer's chair, with the cord ready
in his hands.

       MORTIMER
       Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large
       as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged.
       The big dope !

He bursts out laughing... But only for two seconds, because
Jonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind, and Einstein
shoves the napkin in his open mouth. Einstein then helps Jonathan
to tie Mortimer's legs to the legs of the armchair. Then, with the
help of a knife, he puts all the napkin in Mortimer's mouth.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright.

Fade out, and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later.
The lights have been dimmed. Mortimer is completely tied on the
chair, and the gag is tied around his head.

       JONATHAN
       Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never,
       my dear brother, were you out of my mind.

Jonathan is lighting candles on the table.

       JONATHAN
       In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

He opens his instruments case. We see the surgery instruments
shining in the candles light.

Close-up on Mortimer's very frightened face.

Einstein sits down near the table. He seems depressed at the sight
of his surgery instruments.

Jonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket,
opens it, smells it and closes it, and puts it back in his pocket.

       JONATHAN
       The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle
       yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

He takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it.

Close-up on Mortimer's frightened face.

Einstein wipes his face with a napkin.

Jonathan takes a scalpel from the case and feels the sharpness of
the blade.

Einstein takes a bottle on the table and brings it to his mouth.
Unfortunately, the bottle is empty.
Jonathan takes a pair of surgery gloves from the box and puts them
on.

       JONATHAN
       Now, Doctor, we go to work.

Einstein stands up.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Johnny, for me, please, the quick way. Please.

       JONATHAN
       Doctor, this must be an artistic achievement.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Please.

       JONATHAN
       After all, we're performing before a very distinguished
       critic.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Johnny, please !

       JONATHAN
       Doctor !

Einstein takes his jacket off. He is almost crying.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       All right. Let's get it over with. No, but, Johnny, I
       cannot see this without a drink.

       JONATHAN
       Pull yourself together, Doctor.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       But I can't pull myself together without a drink. Johnny,
       you remember when we came in here, there was some wine. And
       then they took it. Where did they put it ?

A glint of hope appears in Mortimer's eyes at the mention of his
aunts' wine.

Einstein runs across the room to the shelves where the carafe of
poisoned wine has been put away.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Johnny, I found some wine. I found some wine.

He comes back to the table with the carafe and glasses.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Here, I'll split it with you. We both have a drink before
       we operate. Oh, I am so happy that we don't have to operate
       without a drink.

Einstein gives a glass to Jonathan. Mortimer, who recognized the
carafe, is smiling behind his gag. Jonathan smells the glass.
Einstein has his glass almost to his lips, when Jonathan stops
him.

       JONATHAN
       Doctor. One moment, please. Where are your manners ?
       (to Mortimer)
       Yes, Mortimer. I realize now that it was you who brought me
       back to Brooklyn. We drink to you. Doctor ! To my dear,
       dead brother.

They clink their glass in front of Mortimer's face. Einstein
raises his glass before drinking.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Prosit !

Teddy suddenly comes out of his room and plays his bugle very
loudly.

Both Jonathan and Einstein drop their glass on the floor.

Teddy then goes back into his room and slams the door. The grand-
father clock chimes once.
Mortimer seems very disappointed. He moves back and forth in his
chair, moaning.

       JONATHAN
       That idiot ! He goes next. That's all. He goes next !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Not Teddy ! Not Teddy ! Please !

       JONATHAN
       We'll get to him later.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Not Teddy, we won't get to him at all !

       JONATHAN
       Now, we have to work fast. The quick way.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Oh, the quick way, oh yes ! If it has to be, then the quick
       way. Yes, I'll help you with it.

They starts getting the instruments out of the case.

At the front door, we see the shadow of a policeman behind the
frosted glass. He rings the doorbell.

Jonathan and Einstein stop what they were doing. Einstein closes
the case and puts it under the table. He also puts all the
instruments lying on the table on the floor, behind the case.

Knocking on the door. The door being open, O'Hara enters the room.
He spots Jonathan and Einstein.

       O'HARA
       Hey, the colonel has to quit blowing that horn.
       JONATHAN
       It's all right, Officer. We're taking the bugle away from
       him.

       O'HARA
       I'd better talk to him myself. Where's the lights ?

He finds the switch by the door, and switches the lights on. He
goes to the stairs and starts mounting them, when he hears
Mortimer moaning. He goes down and walks toward Mortimer.

       O'HARA
       Hey ! You stood me up ! I've been waiting for you for over
       an hour at Kelly's. What happened to him ?

O'Hara is surprised to find Mortimer tied up on his chair. He
points his stick to Jonathan.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Nothing. He was explaining a play he saw the other night
       and that's what happened to a poor man in the play.
He walks away with his jacket in his hands.

       O'HARA
       Oh, I see. Did that really happen in a play you saw ? How
       do you like that ? You can't trust nobody no more. They
       practically stole that from the second act of my play. You
       know, in the second act, just... Well, maybe I'd better
       start at the beginning.

Mortimer is moving and moaning on his chair. He tries to explain
by movements of his face that he would like to have his gag taken
off.

Behind O'Hara, Einstein starts mounting the stairs, and Jonathan
stands up at the bottom of them.

       O'HARA
       Huh ? Oh, yes, sure.

He puts his hands to Mortimer's face to take off his gag.

Einstein runs upstairs, followed by Jonathan.

Suddenly, O'Hara removes his hands and smiles broadly.

       O'HARA
       Nooo ! You've got to hear the plot !

He takes his jacket off.

       O'HARA
       My mother's sitting there, making up, see. And, like a
       flash, suddenly, out of a clear sky, the door comes open
       and a man with a black mustache comes in.

On the stairs behind O'Hara, Jonathan takes his jack-knife out of
his pocket and opens it.
       O'HARA
       He turns to my mother and he says, «Miss Peaches La Tour,
       will you marry me ?» That's the first scene. My mother
       doesn't tell him they're married. That's the surprise !

Einstein, who has seen the knife, tries to stop Jonathan. But
Jonathan keeps on walking slowly downstairs.

       O'HARA
       Oh, What a kick ! All right. Twenty-five years pass. Well,
       in the meantime, there's me. Growing into a magnificent
       specimen. So what do I do ? I join the police force and
       become one of New York's finest. Well, I'm cleaning out a
       crooked laundry, see ?

Close-up on Jonathan's hand holding the knife, the blade of which
is shining in the light.

Mortimer stares at the knife

       O'HARA
       Little do I know it, but there is a dope fiend with a long
       knife crawling after me. I'm in great danger. It's getting
       you, ain't it ? I can see it in your eyes.

Actually, Mortimer's eyes are trying to attract O'Hara's attention
to Jonathan, just behind him now.

       O'HARA
       Well, you ain't heard nothing yet.

Einstein tries to stop Jonathan, but Jonathan pushes him away.
Einstein takes off one of his shoes, and hits Jonathan very hard
on the head with it. Jonathan falls on the floor.

       O'HARA
       All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The
       firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ?
       Mayor Fiorello La Guardia !

O'Hara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of
the stairs.

       O'HARA
       What's the matter with him ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep.

       O'HARA
       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       I personally, I like it very much.

       O'HARA
       It's probably over his head, huh ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yeah.
O'Hara looks at Jonathan's face.

       O'HARA
       Where have I seen that face before ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       No, please.

He kneels beside Jonathan's body, and O'Hara returns to Mortimer.

       O'HARA
       Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm
       walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a
       guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following
       me !

Knocks at the door. O'Hara turns to Einstein.

       O'HARA
       (to Einstein)
       Don't let nobody in.
       (to Mortimer)
       I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the
       corner.

Einstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of
the front door. He rushes to Jonathan.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Hey, Johnny, the cops !

Einstein tries to wake up Jonathan, but doesn't succeed. He picks
up his shoe and rushes upstairs.

       O'HARA
       So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I
       pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I
       says : «Come in !»

He takes out his gun and points it at the door. Brophy and another
cop, officer Saunders, come in. When they see O'Hara's gun
pointing at them, they raise their arms. O'Hara puts his gun back
in his holster and welcomes his colleagues.

       O'HARA
       Oh, hello, boys.

       BROPHY
       What the Sam Hill's going on here ?

       O'HARA
       Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster.
       He's going to help me write my play.

       SAUNDERS
       Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ?

He starts to untie Mortimer.
       BROPHY
       O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you
       ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you.

       O'HARA
       Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you
       guys here looking for me ?

Brophy goes to the telephone and starts dialing.

       BROPHY
       No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty.
       The colonel blew that bugle again.

       O'HARA
       Yeah, I heard him.

       BROPHY
       The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the
       warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace.

He sees Jonathan lying on the steps.
       BROPHY
       Now, who the heck is this ?

       O'HARA
       Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to
       sleep.

       BROPHY
       Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back.
       (in the phone)
       Brophy. Get me Mac.
       (to O'Hara)
       Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours
       overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found
       you.

O'Hara bends on Jonathan and shakes him

       O'HARA
       Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ?

       BROPHY
       (in the phone)
       Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt.
       We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him
       in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here.

He puts the phone down and turns to O'Hara, who has succeeded in
waking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet. Jonathan stares at
Brophy. He thinks Brophy is talking about him.

Mortimer looks at his left hand, which has just been freed by
Saunders.

       BROPHY
       The Lieutenant is on his way over.
       JONATHAN
       So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I
       suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the
       reward.

Brophy and O'Hara each take one arm of Jonathan.

       BROPHY & O'HARA
       Reward ?

       JONATHAN
       Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in !

Mortimer, who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is
still gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair, moans
and moves excitedly on his seat.

       O'HARA
       (to Jonathan)
       Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

       JONATHAN
       You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't
       you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar !
       Yes, thirteen.

Mortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag.
Since he cannot succeed to get off the chair, he stands up, still
gagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy,
carrying the armchair with him.

       BROPHY
       Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be
       friends of ours.

       JONATHAN
       I'll show them to you.

       BROPHY
       Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me !

Mortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan, and tries to say
something to Brophy through his gag. Saunders, behind Mortimer,
keeps on untying him.

       BROPHY
       (to Mortimer)
       Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care
       of him.

       JONATHAN
       (to O'Hara)
       You come down to the cellar.

       O'HARA
       (to Jonathan)
       Now, wait a minute.

Mortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to O'Hara and
Brophy, and moves excitedly around the two cops. He moves so much
that Saunders has stopped trying to untie him.

       JONATHAN
       Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried.

       O'HARA
       Oh, yeah !

       BROPHY
       Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara.

       JONATHAN
       Yes, come to the cellar.

He grabs O'Hara's hand and drags him to the cellar door.

       O'HARA
       Well, look, do I have to ?

Mortimer, still gagged, and still carrying his armchair like a
backpack, tries to follow them, but Saunders moves him away.
Mortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going
down to the cellar, with Saunders running behind him.

       O'HARA
       Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with
       him.

Mortimer bumps violently into Brophy, who tries to push him away.

       BROPHY
       O'Hara, go on down the cellar with him !

Mortimer then goes to O'Hara, but O'Hara doesn't realize Mortimer
is coming to him to prevent him going down to the cellar.

       O'HARA
       Now, please, Mister Brewster. I'll tell you the rest of my
       play later.

He pushes Mortimer away from him.

       BROPHY
       Go on down to the cellar with him.

       O'HARA
       Gee, do I have to, Sarge ? Look at that puss. He looks like
       Boris Karloff.

Hearing that, Jonathan screams, jumps on O'Hara and puts his hand
around his throat.

       O'HARA
       (to Jonathan)
       Don't !
       (to Brophy)
       Sarge !

The three cops and Jonathan starts fighting. A fist comes out of
the battle and hits Mortimer on the chin. He staggers back to the
center of the room, and falls on the floor.

We see Einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper
floor of the house. He slowly comes down the stairs.

Down in the sitting-room, the fight goes on. Saunders falls on his
back and Jonathan jumps on him. O'Hara, in his turn, jumps on
Jonathan. Behind them, Mortimer is slowly getting up and getting
rid of his ropes. Apparently, his fall has completely untied him.

Einstein, watching this heated fight, moves back to the upper
floor.

Mortimer gets rid of his gag, and slowly moves away from the
battle.

       BROPHY
       (voice over)
       Look out, Pat !... Look out, Pat !

       SAUNDERS
       (voice over)
       He's got a gun...

       BROPHY
       (voice over)
       I got him, Pat. Look out !

       MORTIMER
       Fight. Go on and fight.

Mortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a
step.

       MORTIMER
       That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.

       BROPHY
       (voice over)
       Pat ! Pat, look out!

Mortimer, still seated on the step, quietly gets his cigarette
case from his pocket, takes a cigarette, puts the case back in his
pocket, while we hears the noise of the battle still going on down
below.

       MORTIMER
       Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the
       bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.

He takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette.
Behind Mortimer, on the wall, we see the shadows of the men
fighting. Then we see various objects falling around Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       Don't... Don't bother me now.

O'Hara is projected on the wall below the staircase, near the
place where Mortimer is still quietly seated.
       MORTIMER
       Buddy, you could use this in the third act.

       O'HARA
       Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell
       you...

Jonathan breaks a chair on his back. O'Hara staggers slightly.

       O'HARA
       I'll see you later.

He goes back in the battle. Jonathan gives him a heavy punch and
O'Hara falls in the window-seat, closing the lid over himself in
his fall.

Back to Mortimer, still quietly smoking his cigarette, seated on
the same step. He takes papers out of his pocket.

       MORTIMER
       I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do
       I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight-
       fight !

O'Hara cautiously lifts the lid of the window-seat, but seeing a
chair flying in his direction, he slams it back shut. The chair
hits the window-seat and breaks off in small pieces.

Back to Mortimer on his steps. He puts the papers back in his
pocket.

       MORTIMER
       I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.

He puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the
telephone on the desk, but he cannot reach it.

       MORTIMER
       Telephone. Hey !

At this moment, Jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the
staircase. He grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the
cops, bringing it within easy reach of Mortimer's hand.

       JONATHAN
       I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the
       first one that comes near me !

Mortimer picks up the telephone handset, and starts dialing.

       MORTIMER
       Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.

Jonathan is watching the cops around him, and he is not looking at
all at his brother behind him. Without thinking about it, he lifts
the telephone a little higher.

       MORTIMER
       Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine.
Jonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his
head toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him
with his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick
up the telephone not to loose it.

       MORTIMER
       Oh ! Don't do that, please.

       BROPHY
       Get him, Pat.

Saunders comes on the other side of Jonathan and hits him with his
stick.

       MORTIMER
       (in the phone)
       Come on, doc...
       (to the cops)
       That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...

Jonathan falls heavily on the floor.
       MORTIMER
       Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?

O'Hara slowly lifts the lid of the window-seat.

Saunders bends on the motionless body of Jonathan

       MORTIMER
       Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

The doorbell rings, and we see the shadow of a hatted man through
the frosted glass. Mortimer looks at the door.

       MORTIMER
       Witherspoon !

       BROPHY
       Come in.

The visitor enters. It's Lieutenant Rooney, a plain-cloth
policeman. He closes the door behind him. Both Brophy and Saunders
stand at attention. Mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its
hook. O'Hara comes out of the window-seat, and, seeing his
superior, stands at attention. Rooney walks to the body of
Jonathan.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What has occurred ?

       BROPHY & SAUNDERS
       (speaking together)
       Well, we...

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Never mind ! Didn't I tell you I'd handle this myself ?

O'Hara comes out of the window-seat to join his colleagues.
       O'HARA
       Well, Lieutenant ! We were just acting in self-defense.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (pointing to the body of Jonathan)
       What happened ? He put up a fight ?

       BROPHY
       This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his
       brother. He tried to kill O'Hara.

       O'HARA
       All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Boris ?... Turn him over.

Saunders turns Jonathan over and both the lieutenant and Brophy
bends on the face of Jonathan.

       BROPHY
       Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.
Rooney stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Oh ! You «kind of think he's wanted somewhere» ? If you
       guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station,
       you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly,
       he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the
       prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

Still seated on his step, Mortimer smiles.

       MORTIMER
       That's my brother !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. «He
       looked like Karloff». Why'd you have to knock him off ?

       BROPHY
       He tried to get us to go down to the cellar. He says there
       are thirteen bodies buried down there.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar, and that don't tip
       you off the guy's come from a nuthouse ?

       MORTIMER
       Thanks, pal.

       O'HARA
       Say, lieutenant, about my not ringing in, I want to
       explain...

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Where have you been all night ? Don't bother to tell me.

       O'HARA
       Oh, I was right here writing a play with Mortimer Brewster.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Yeah ?

       O'HARA
       Yeah.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Well, you're going to have a long time on that play.

       O'HARA
       Yeah ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       You're suspended. Now go on. Report in.

Teddy comes out of his room, with his bugle under his arm, and
walks downstairs

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (voice over)
       Take this guy out in the kitchen and bring a pillow. I want
       to find out where his accomplice is.

       TEDDY
       (to Mortimer)
       What is the meaning of this commotion ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       The guy who helped him escape. He's wanted, too.

Teddy gives his bugle to Mortimer.

       TEDDY
       Here.

He joins the group of policemen.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Forty-eight hours I've been after these guys. Nothing to
       eat. No sleep. No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.
       With flatheads like you on the force. Falling for a story
       like that ! Thirteen bodies buried down in the cellar.

       TEDDY
       But there are thirteen bodies in the cellar !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Who are you ?

       TEDDY
       I'm President Roosevelt.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (whispering to Brophy)
       What the blazes is this ?

       BROPHY
       He's the guy that blows the bugle.
       SAUNDERS
       Howdy, Colonel.

Saunders and Brophy both salutes Teddy. Teddy salutes them back.
Rooney raises his hand to salute, but rapidly puts it down with a
disgusted expression on his face.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Well, Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.
       (pointing to Jonathan's body)
       Come on, get this guy out of here.

       TEDDY
       Dear me ! Another yellow-fever victim ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What ?

       TEDDY
       All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims.
       BROPHY
       No-no-no, Colonel. This is a spy. We caught him at the
       White House.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Take him out and bring him to. I want to question him.

Brophy and Saunders lift Jonathan and carry him to the kitchen.

       TEDDY
       If there is any questioning of spies, that's my department.

He follows the two cops. But Rooney stops him.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Hey, you, keep out of that.

       TEDDY
       You're forgetting that as President, I am also head of the
       Secret Service.

He follows the two cops in the kitchen. Rooney goes to the table,
takes the carafe and smells it. Mortimer watches him, still seated
on his step.

       MORTIMER
       Huh-huh-huh !

Rooney puts the carafe back on the table, and looks at Mortimer.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Who are you ? What's your name ?

       MORTIMER
       Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster. But I'm not quite myself
       today.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Oh, you're his brother. Now, look, Mister Brewster, no
       argument. He's got to be put away.

Mortimer stands up and goes down the steps toward the lieutenant.

       MORTIMER
       No, no, no arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute,
       take it easy. Read this.

He takes the papers from his pocket and show them to Rooney.

       MORTIMER
       Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight. I'm just waiting
       here for Mr. Witherspoon.

Rooney looks at the documents.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Well, as long as he's going someplace. He's scaring the
       neighbors, what with that bugle and all. And that cockeyed
       story about thirteen bodies being buried...
Rooney stops, looks around with a suspicious eye and takes his hat
off.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       You know, I've been without sleep for forty-eight hours.
       I'm liable to think anything.

       MORTIMER
       I know just how you feel.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       There's people dumb enough to believe a story like that.
       Last year there was a crazy guy, started a murder rumor. I
       had to dig up a half acre plot before I could prove...
       Ohh ! What's this ?

Rooney puts the papers down.

       MORTIMER
       What's the matter ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       These papers are no good.

       MORTIMER
       Why not ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       He signed it Theodore Roosevelt !

Rooney shows the papers to Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       He what ?...

Mortimer looks at the papers with horror in his face and takes
them back.
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The cab driver is seated with O'Hara and Witherspoon standing on
either side of him.

       WITHERSPOON
       Is your cab engaged ?

       CAB DRIVER
       Yeah ! I'm losing dough every minute. Got me offers ?

       WITHERSPOON
       I'm Mister Witherspoon of Happy Dale Sanitarium, I have
       come here to collect a Brewster. I would like you to drive
       us back to the sanitarium.

He walks to the entrance of the house. O'Hara stays with the cab
driver.

       CAB DRIVER
       I knew this would end up in a nuthouse !
Witherspoon comes back a few steps.

       WITHERSPOON
       We like to think of it as a rest home.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Witherspoon enters the room. We hear voices talking excitedly. And
we see people in some sort of a large alcove at the back of the
sitting-room, between the cellar-door and the grandfather clock.

       WITHERSPOON
       Mister Brewster ? Mister Brewster ?

Through the hole in the kitchen door, we see Brophy talking.

       WITHERSPOON
       Mr. Witherspoon is here.

Witherspoon slams the door.

In the alcove, Mortimer, Rooney and Teddy are having an argument.
Mortimer still has the bugle in his hand.

       MORTIMER
       Supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name
       Theodore Roosevelt on it. Think what that would mean to the
       safety of the nation !

Rooney holds the document for Teddy, who has a pen in his hand.

       TEDDY
       No, it's chicanery.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, wasting the time.

Saunders approaches his lieutenant.
       SAUNDERS
       He's come to. He's ready to talk.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Hold him till I get there.

       SAUNDERS
       Yes, sir.

He moves away back to the kitchen.

       MORTIMER
       Let me explain. The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt.

       TEDDY
       Code for Roosevelt ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes, don't you see ? Take the name Brewster. Take away the
       «B» and what have you got ?
       TEDDY
       Rooster.

       MORTIMER
       And what does a rooster do ?

       TEDDY
       Crows.

       MORTIMER
       It crows! And where are you hunting in Africa ?

       TEDDY
       On the veldt !

       MORTIMER
       There you are ! «Crowsveldt».

Mortimer gives a quick look at Rooney.

       TEDDY
       Ingenious ! My compliments to the boys in the code
       department.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Hey, that's all right ! Do that again for me.

       TEDDY
       Never mind ! Give me that pen. This is fun.

He signs the paper under Rooney's supervision.

       MORTIMER
       Now, now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

He runs to the table in the middle of the sitting-room, where
Witherspoon is standing. He goes around the table to shake hands
with him.
       MORTIMER
       Oh ! Oh ! Mister Witherspoon, I can't tell you how glad I
       am to see you. Mister Witherspoon... Before... Look... You
       will take good care of Teddy at Happy Dale ?

       WITHERSPOON
       Best of care of him, Mister Brewster.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, that's fine. And no wagon when he leaves.

       WITHERSPOON
       Why ? To take him away ? Oh, never, never. Taxicabs. We
       always... I have one waiting now.

       MORTIMER
       Yes, look, it means a great deal to me. You will personally
       see that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale ?

       WITHERSPOON
       He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.
       MORTIMER
       Oh, that's good.

       WITHERSPOON
       You know, I sometimes envy some of our patients, secretly,
       you know.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, you do ? It must be a nice place. Because I've never
       been to Happy Dale.

       WITHERSPOON
       You never can tell.

Mortimer looks surprised by Witherspoon's answer. Then he looks
also a bit horrified.

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, this is a particularly happy moment for me tonight,
       Mister... Mister Brewster. Yes, I've never met a dramatic
       critic and I had been so anxious to.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, the woods are full of them.

       WITHERSPOON
       I have here something that will explain what we're trying
       to do out there at Happy Dale.

He gets a booklet out of his pocket.

       MORTIMER
       Oh ! A pamphlet about Happy Dale ?

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, no-no, it's a play. Something I've been working on for
       some time now.
When Mortimer sees Witherspoon flipping the pages of his booklet,
a slightly frightened look comes to his face.

       WITHERSPOON
       It's a dramatization of many of the little incidents
       that have happened here at Happy Dale.

       MORTIMER
       Captain ! Captain !... Captain !

Rooney, who was checking the documents signed by Teddy, turns
around.

       WITHERSPOON
       Now, I want you to read this very carefully. I want you to
       be just as harsh as you like. I shan't mind, you know...

Rooney comes toward them with the documents in his hand.

       MORTIMER
       Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon.
Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile.

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my
       boy.

Witherspoon takes Rooney's arm. Rooney pushes him away.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What is this?

       MORTIMER
       No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This
       is... this is Captain Rooney.

       WITHERSPOON
       The police ?... Oh !

The two men shake hands, and Rooney gives the papers to
Witherspoon.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take
       him away, Super.

Teddy joins them.

       TEDDY
       I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

       MORTIMER
       Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of
       office is over.

       TEDDY
       Is this March the four ?
       MORTIMER
       Practically.

       TEDDY
       Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa !
       Well, I must get started immediately.

Teddy starts walking away, but he stops suddenly and gives
Witherspoon a suspicious look.

       TEDDY
       Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved
       out ?

       MORTIMER
       Who, Mister President ?

Teddy looks at Witherspoon with a disgusted face.

       TEDDY
       Taft !
       MORTIMER
       No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister
       Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa.

Teddy shakes hands with Witherspoon.

       TEDDY
       Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my
       equipment.

Witherspoon looks at Teddy walking away with a sweet smile.

       WITHERSPOON
       Happy man.

Teddy starts going upstairs and he meets Abby and Martha coming
down. They're dressed back in their usual clothes. Teddy shakes
hands with them.

       TEDDY
       Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to
       Africa. Isn't it wonderful ?

For the last time, Teddy takes out his imaginary sword, points it
forward and rushes upstairs.

       TEDDY
       Charge !

He gets into his room and slams the door behind him. Witherspoon
looks a bit surprised, and Mortimer holds the hands of the
grandfather clock. Abby joins him

       MORTIMER
       It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it.

Witherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes.
       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine walks across the churchyard toward the Brewster's house.
She is wearing a coat over her nightdress.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby and Martha are talking with Witherspoon.

       MARTHA
       You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (voice over)
       No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle
       again.

Both sisters turn toward Rooney.
       ABBY
       Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it.

       MARTHA
       We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be
       separated from Teddy.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       I'm sorry.

       ABBY
       Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law
       is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go.

       ABBY
       Well, if he's going, we're going, too !

       MARTHA
       Yes, you'll have to take us with him.

Mortimer smiles broadly.

       MORTIMER
       Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ?

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but
       it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy
       Dale.

Mortimer comes very close to Witherspoon, and tries, by mime only,
to induce Witherspoon to take his aunts.

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, no-no-no-no...
       MORTIMER
       (whispering)
       Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the
       others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange
       that.

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, no-no-no-no...

       MORTIMER
       Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up.

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine has now reached the Brewster house and opens a window. We
hear Lieutenant Rooney's voice.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (voice over)
       Now, let's be sensible, ladies...

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Rooney is talking to the Brewster sisters.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       ...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some
       serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders
       to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing,
       and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to
       get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

       ABBY
       Our cellar ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Yeah.

Mortimer seems a bit worried.

       MORTIMER
       Oh-oh !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Yeah, Teddy's been telling around there's thirteen bodies
       buried in the cellar.

       ABBY
       But there are thirteen bodies in our cellar.

Witherspoon, who was looking at something on the table, looks up,
very surprised by what Abby just said.

Behind the window and the drapes, where she is hiding and
eavesdropping, Elaine looks very surprised too.
Rooney smiles a little, and then becomes suddenly very serious.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What ?

       ABBY
       Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

Mortimer blows the bugle very loudly. Rooney puts his hands on his
ears. Then Mortimer rushes upstairs, yelling :

       MORTIMER
       Charge !

Mortimer reaches the balcony. Teddy comes out of his room, looking
intrigued

       MORTIMER
       (whispering)
       Isn't that amazing ?

       ABBY
       Now, Mortimer, you behave yourself. You know very well
       there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar.

       MORTIMER
       Certainly there's thirteen bodies down in the cellar. And
       there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain !

Teddy taps the side of his head with his finger, goes back into
his room, and closes the door. Mortimer tries to indicate by mime
that his aunts are crazy

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What is this ?

Very quick shot of Elaine peeking behind the drapes

       MARTHA
       You mustn't mind Mortimer.

Saunders comes to his lieutenant.

       SAUNDERS
       How about it, lieutenant ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       I'll be right there.

He moves away.

       MARTHA
       He's been a little strange all day.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Well, right now I wouldn't know what is and what ain't
       strange anymore. I'll better have a look in that cellar.

       MORTIMER
       I'll tell you what we'll do, Captain. I'll bring my bodies
       down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar,
       and we'll get them all together, and we'll send them to
       Happy Dale.

He sings the last words, trying again to mime to Rooney that his
two aunts are crazy.

       ABBY
       No, no, you wouldn't have to dig. The graves are all
       marked. We put flowers on them every Sunday.

Mortimer walks downstairs.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Flowers ?

       MORTIMER
       Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

He whispers to Rooney from the staircase.

       MORTIMER
       Humor them, humor them. Smile.

Rooney doesn't seem to understand what Mortimer is trying to tell
him. But Witherspoon is beginning to understand.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What ?

       ABBY
       There's one down there, a Mister Spenalzo...

       MORTIMER
       (whispering)
       Hasn't got it yet.

He resumes his walking downstairs.

       ABBY
       ...who doesn't belong here and who's going to have to
       leave.

       MARTHA
       But the other twelve are our gentlemen.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Your gentlemen ?

       MORTIMER
       Oh, you'd like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen.

       ABBY
       You mustn't mind him at all. He got married today.

       MORTIMER
       (singing)
       «There is a Happy Dale far, far away. There is a Happy"

While singing, Mortimer makes signs to Rooney and Witherspoon.
And, finally, Rooney understand what Mortimer is trying to tell
him, that his aunts are crazy.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (nodding)
       Yeah, yeah.

       MORTIMER
       He got it. It's amazing.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (to Witherspoon)
       Look, Super, don't you think you can find room for the
       ladies ?

       WITHERSPOON
       Just the ladies ?

He looks at Mortimer. Mortimer stops clowning, and becomes very
serious.

       MORTIMER
       Just the ladies, not me !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       How about it, Super ?

       WITHERSPOON
       Well, of course, they'd have to be committed.

       WITHERSPOON
       Well, Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they commit
       themselves also ? All they have to do is sign the papers.

       WITHERSPOON
       Certainly.

       MARTHA
       Oh well, if we can go with Teddy, we'll sign the papers.
       Where are they ?

Witherspoon takes the papers out of the inside pocket of his coat.

       WITHERSPOON
       I have them, ladies, I have them right here.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (to Witherspoon)
       Sign them up, will you, Super ? I want this all cleaned up.
       I'm going out to talk to that spy. Maybe I can understand
       him. Thirteen bodies down in the cellar.

Rooney, absent-mindedly, is ready to go down to the cellar, but he
checks himself and goes toward the kitchen instead.

       WITHERSPOON
       Ladies, if you will sign right here.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
Elaine opens a large trapdoor opening on a stairway going down to
the cellar. She starts going down that passage.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein walks on the balcony, carrying a suitcase, and starts
going downstairs. In the room, we can guess that the two sisters
are signing the papers.

       ABBY
       (voice over)
       Right here ?

       WITHERSPOON
       (voice over)
       Yes, please. It's on the right-hand side right there.

Martha and Abby are seated at the table, signing the papers.
Witherspoon and Mortimer, standing besides them, are helping them.

       ABBY
       I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here
       has changed so.

       MARTHA
       Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing.

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh... oh, dear, I'm so sorry. We've overlooked something.
       It's absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a
       physician.

Einstein has reached the bottom of the stairs and he is sneaking
out through the front door.

       MORTIMER
       A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some
       papers, please.

Einstein turns around.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Good night.

       MORTIMER
       Come here, Doctor Einstein.

       WITHERSPOON
       A doctor ?

       MORTIMER
       Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier
       this evening. Come on, Doctor.

Einstein drops his suitcase by the front door, and comes to the
table.

       MORTIMER
       Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor.
Einstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him. Meanwhile, Rooney and
Saunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room.

       ABBY
       Were you leaving, Doctor ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       Yes, please.

       MARTHA
       Oh ! Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN
       I don't think we go to the same place.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (speaking on the telephone)
       Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that's wanted in Indiana.
       His accomplice's description is one on the circular, on the
       desk. Read it to me, will you ?

Einstein leaves the table, and almost bumps into Saunders, who is
brushing his uniform. He listen to the description of himself that
Rooney is repeating from his colleague at the police station.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       (still on the phone)
       Yeah... About forty... Five-foot-three... One hundred and
       forty pounds... Pop eyes... Talks with a German accent...
       Poses as a doctor... Okay, Mac. Thanks.

He puts the phone back on its hook.

Witherspoon slaps Einstein on the back, and Einstein starts
raising his arms.

       WITHERSPOON
       It's all right, Lieutenant Rooney. The doctor here has
       completed the signatures.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Oh, that's great ! Thanks, Doc. You've done Brooklyn a
       great service.

He shakes Einstein's hand and slaps his back. Einstein cannot
believe his luck. He smiles and rushes to the door.

       ABBY
       But Dr. Einstein !

Einstein picks up his suitcase, and rushes out of the door, and
closes it behind him.

       WITHERSPOON
       (to Mortimer)
       Now, Mister Witherspoon...

       MORTIMER
       No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster.
       WITHERSPOON
       (laughing)
       It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

       MORTIMER
       Now, don't play games...

       WITHERSPOON
       You sign. You sign as next of kin.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, next of kin. Why didn't you say so ? I'm all confused.
       Don't mind me.

Teddy appears on the balcony, all dressed up in his colonial
costume, but without the helmet.

       TEDDY
       Mr. Witherport.

       WITHERSPOON
       Spoon.
Mortimer picks up a spoon on the table and gives it to
Witherspoon.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, here it is.

       TEDDY
       Come up and pack my duffel.

       WITHERSPOON
       Duffel ?

       MORTIMER
       Yes, duffel. Pack his duffel. He's President, you know ?

       WITHERSPOON
       Oh !

       TEDDY
       And bring along my bugle.

Witherspoon looks on the table, where the bugle is, and then at
Mortimer. Mortimer makes a little agreement sign.

       MORTIMER
       President.

Witherspoon picks up the bugle, and starts walking upstairs. He
stops after a few steps, as if he were hesitating.

       MORTIMER
       Don't charge !

Mortimer and Witherspoon are exchanging faces. Martha and Abby are
whispering into each other's ear.

       ABBY
       Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about
       something.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, now, darling, don't be worried.

He kisses Abby.

       MARTHA
       Me too, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER
       Well, of course, darling.

He kisses Martha.

       MORTIMER
       You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will
       you.

       MARTHA
       Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing,
       but that's just it. We don't want anything to go wrong.

       MORTIMER
       Well, what would go wrong ?

       ABBY
       Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ?

       MORTIMER
       Oh, no, they won't look up Dr. Einstein...

       MARTHA
       But it's not his signature, dear. It's yours.

       MORTIMER
       Mine ?

       ABBY
       You see, you signed as next of kin.

       MORTIMER
       Oh, what's wrong about that, darling ?

       ABBY
       Well... Martha, you tell him now.

       MARTHA
       Well, dear.

       MORTIMER
       What, dear ?

       MARTHA
       You're not really a Brewster.

Mortimer, who had a happy smile on his face until now, suddenly
looks very surprised.
       MORTIMER
       Huh ? What ? What ?

       ABBY
       Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about
       three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and
       such a good cook, we didn't want to lose her. So brother
       married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a
       chef on a tramp steamer.

       MORTIMER
       You mean... you mean I'm not really a Brewster ?... Oh !

He almost falls backward. Both sisters catch him up.

       MARTHA
       Oh, darling ! Don't feel so badly about it.

       ABBY
       I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine.

He yells several whooping cries and then kisses them both very
affectionately. Then he rushes to the window, jumps into the open
window-seat, opens the drapes and yells outside.

       MORTIMER
       Elaine ! Elaine ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? I'm not
       really a Brewster ! I'm the son of a sea cook !

We hear Elaine screaming. Elaine comes running upstairs from the
cellar.

       ELAINE
       Mortimer ! Mortimer ! Mortimer ! It's true ! It's true ! I
       saw them. Mortimer, it's true.

Rooney and Saunders come out of the kitchen.

       ELAINE
       It's true ! There are thirteen bodies down there !

Mortimer tries to make her shut up, and succeeds only by kissing
her very passionately on the mouth.

       ELAINE
       (mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)
       But I saw them

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What's all this screaming about ?

Elaine tries to put a few words but Mortimer keeps on kissing her.

       ELAINE
       (mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)
       But I saw them...

       MORTIMER
       It's way past her bedtime.
With his mouth still pressed on her, he lifts her and carries her
across the room to the front door.

       MORTIMER
       Quiet !

       ELAINE
       But, Mortimer...

       MORTIMER
       Goodbye !

He opens the door and rushes outside. The two sisters come to the
door, waving goodbyes to him.

       ABBY
       Bye.

       MARTHA
       Goodbye, darling !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       What is all this ?

       ABBY
       They're going on their honeymoon.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY
       Well, they're off to a flying start.

The two sisters burst laughing and turn to the door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer comes out of the house, still carrying Elaine with his
mouth pressed on her. O'Hara and the cab driver, who were chatting
together, jump up and look at the strange couple. Mortimer, still
carrying Elaine, moves along the house, with the cab driver
following him.

       O'HARA
       (finishing the story he was telling the cab driver)
       I pull my gun at...

       CAB DRIVER
       Hey !

       MORTIMER
       What ?

       ELAINE
       I really did see...

       CAB DRIVER
       Hey ! You'll own two cabs !

       MORTIMER
       Huh ?

       CAB DRIVER
       I mean the meter !

Elaine, eventually, comes out of her hysteria. She puts her arms
around Mortimer, and talks to him in a very sweet voice.

       ELAINE
       Oh, Mortimer.

They kiss very tenderly. The cab driver comes closer to the couple
and looks at their closed-eyes faces.

       CAB DRIVER
       (imitating Elaine's voice)
       Oh, Mortimer.

Mortimer turns to him.

       MORTIMER
       (to the cab driver)
       Oh, we're going to Niagara Falls. Call me a cab, dear.

       CAB DRIVER
       Yes, love.

The cab driver realizes his mistake and checks himself.

       CAB DRIVER
       But, Mister Brewster !

       MORTIMER
       No, no, I'm not a Brewster. I'm a son of a sea cook.

He laughs and lifts a very surprised Elaine on his shoulder, and
runs through the churchyard towards Reverend Harper's house.

       MORTIMER
       Charge !

The cab driver puts his hands to his face, then takes them away
and yells :

       CAB DRIVER
       I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot !

With one hand on his cap, and the other hand extended on his side,
he mimes a coffeepot.

In the background, we see Mortimer entering the house, with Elaine
still on his shoulder. The cab driver drops his arms and walks
back to his taxi.

            Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face:
            Tense, course features, thick beard... He's BUD CARTER, 31.

            AN INTERSTATE SIGN PASSES ON THE RIGHT: "WHISKEY BAY"

            Bud pulls onto a dirt road, into a TRAILER PARK and stops.

            INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - DUSK

            TITLE IN: Denham Springs, Louisiana. 1983.

            We're staring at three sacks of sample unmounted EMERALDS,
            set on a filthy counter.

                                SOUTHERN MAN'S VOICE O.S.

            hair, leading Bud through the sale...

                      Now them first two, you gonna get your
                      money's worth.
                          (re: COLUMBIA EMERALDS)
                      This one here's more expensive, but
                      that's 'cause there ain't a nigger flaw

                                BUD
                      That's nice.

                                GRACE
                      That's the real McCoy. That's what that
                      is.

                                BUD
                      Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The
                      market's got a hard-on for this shit.

                                GRACE
                      I hear that.
                          (across the room)
                      Jake, get on it.

            ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons
            at a table, riffing through Bud's cash.

            A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin,
            bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray
            clicks on the TV and opens a beer. 

            TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception.

                                NEWSCASTER
                      ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary
                      Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of

                      murder in the slaying of accused sex
                      offender, Jeffrey Doucett.

            Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a
            credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues
            throughout the scene... 

                                NEWSCASTER (TV)
                      ...District Court Judge Frank Salia,

            Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of
            emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut
            DIAMONDS.

                                BUD
                      What do you got there? Diamonds?

                                GRACE
                      That's thirty grand. Out the door. You
                      interested?

                      Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am
                      interested.

            And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent...

                      courthouse. However, missing from today's
                      hearing, was the arresting officer.

            Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last
            statement. He sneaks a look.

                      ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter.

            Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger
            photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM.

            EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME 

            Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.

            INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge

                      Doucett was being extradited to Baton
                      Rouge.

            Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV.

            Grace is bagging emeralds.

            Jake and Doug count cash.

            Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing.

            TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one
            phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns...

                                NEWSCASTER
                      The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood
                      waiting at the terminal. As Doucett
                      walked by, Plauche turned, raised a
                      handgun...and fired.

            Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward
            with the emeralds in a satchel.

                                GRACE
                      Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues.
                      Wholesale. Twenty large.

            Sudden GUNSHOTS and SCREAMS on the TV. Everyone turns...

            TV IN: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as POLICE wrestle Gary
            Plauche to the ground amid chaos.

                                NEWSCASTER
                      Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for

            TIGHT ON RAY'S EYES, intense, watching the footage. 

            As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat, WE SEE what Ray
            sees...

            TV IN: Bud, POLICE BADGE AROUND HIS NECK, arresting Plauche.

            ON RAY, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud.
            And again. EYES LOCK, THEY BOTH KNOW.

                                RAY
                      Motherfucker, he's a cop.

            Bud yanks a .45.

            And everything happens at once.

            A SUDDEN GUNSHOT and Jake FIRES again.

            Wood splinters as Bud FIRES back.

            Jake is HIT in the throat. A SECOND SHOT in the forehead - he
            SLAMS against the window, cracking it...

            Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew: TODD SHEPARD,

            Gunshots ECHO.

                                SHEPARD

            Marandino, behind the wheel, SLAMS his foot on the gas.

            A SHOT ZIPS across Bud's back; he SPINS off the table.

            On his knees, Doug is firing a .32. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM.

            Bud FIRES a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him.

            A HOLE EXPLODES beside Bud's head -- Grace FIRING a .45 -- as
            Ray SCREAMS and runs out the door.

            SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the
            mud.

            Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs.
            Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...

            Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard.

            Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45
            held tight, he runs out after Grace.

            ACROSS THE YARD

            the chase rages. 

            MOVING WITH GRACE

            as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of
            chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free...

            MOVING WITH BUD

            at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES
            Grace disappear in the shadows.

            Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes
            darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then
            turns the corner...

            GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!!

            The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground,
            with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up...

            Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.

            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - AFTER HOURS

            At a table, the METRO SQUAD: Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb
            are drinking. A bartender (SHERRY) is wiping down glasses...

                                COBB
                      Think I broke a knuckle on that guy's
                      tooth.

                                SHEPARD
                      He only had one tooth.

                                COBB
                      Well I got it, didn't I?

                                MARANDINO
                          (to the bartender)
                      Another round, Sherry.

                                SHERRY
                      Comin' up.

            Bud blows smoke, distant from the others.

                                MARANDINO
                      Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'.
                      'Been workin' this case for months. And
                      you ain't said shit.

                                BUD
                      They had a lot of weight. Too much.

                                COBB
                      It's a ring. Organized burglary. 

                                BUD
                      You saw them guys. You think that half
                      ass crew was organized?

                                MARANDINO
                          (laughs)
                      They shit their pants in unison.

                                COBB
                      What are you gettin' after, Bud?

                                SHEPARD
                      You think it was someone else's score. 

            Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on.

                                BUD
                      I think its a part of somethin' bigger.

            Bud takes his shot.

                                BUD
                      Tomorrow morning we put our friends under
                      the lamp. If they know this "someone
                      else", we'll know him too.

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - ESTABLISH - NEXT DAY

            A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway.

            INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY

            Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're
            looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM,
            where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler.

                                RAY
                      I told you... I keep tellin' you... I
                      don't know nothin'. That's it.

                                COBB
                      That's not it. We've been here all
                      morning. We'll stay here all night.

            Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino
            is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose).

                                MARANDINO
                      The stones you were fencin' belonged to
                      an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers".
                      The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both
                      owners can verify their belongings, and
                      have. 
                          (beat)
                      Who you fencin' for?

                                GRACE
                      Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit.

                                MARANDINO
                      Then your name's on a dozen other jobs,
                      just like it.

                                GRACE
                      That's bullshit.

                                MARANDINO
                      No, that's a promise.

            Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview...

                                COBB
                      We got a series of burglaries in the
                      area. All over the last six months. All
                      still open. You don't talk, it's on you.

                                RAY
                      Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that.

                                COBB
                      Any idea who does?

                                RAY
                      No! Okay? Fuck no.

            Bud sets down his coffee, calm.

            INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM

            Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated.

                                MARANDINO
                      ...Answer the question.

                                GRACE
                          (exploding)
                      MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S
                      JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS!

            The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against
            the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down.

                                BUD
                      Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb
                      to be any more than a courier. I know
                      you're coverin' for someone else. NOW
                      TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!

                                GRACE
                      I ain't a rat!

                                BUD
                      YOU AIN'T A RAT?!

            Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS.

                                MARANDINO
                      Easy, Bud. Go easy.

                                GRACE
                          (to Marandino)
                      STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM!

            Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off.

                                BUD
                      LOCK THE DOOR!

            Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder,
            nearly rips it off his face.

                                BUD
                      I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll
                      throw you in an eight by nine and have
                      you fucked in the ass by every inmate in
                      the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE
                      REST OF YOUR LIFE!

            Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks.

                                BUD
                      GIVE ME A NAME!

                                GRACE
                          (hacking)
                      He's from Whiskey Bay--!

                                BUD
                      --GIVE ME A NAME!!

            EXT. CLAYTON STREET - NIGHT

            Raining.

            An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home.

                                BUD V.O.
                      Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one.

            INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

            Bud's in the front seat, looking through a file. Shepard at
            the wheel. Coffee cups and junk food litter the dash.

                                BUD
                      Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a
                      jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives.
                          (turns the page)
                      Seven and a half out of a twelve year
                      stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola.
                      A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with
                      a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with
                      a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released
                      from Oxford, 1981.

                                SHEPARD
                      Jacket's the size of the bible.

            Through the windshield, across the street, a tract home
            they're watching.

                                BUD
                      His stay at Marion, they kept him in "H"
                      block.

                                SHEPARD
                      H block? That's home to forty top murder
                      one inmates...

                                BUD
                      Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had
                      twelve years.

            Bud likes it.

                                BUD
                      He ain't just woodwork.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
            Night passes and the dawn arrives...

            EXT. WHEELER'S HOUSE - DAWN

            Front door opens and the shadowy figure of JESSE WHEELER,
            whose face we cannot see, emerges.

                                SHEPARD
                          (waking Bud)
                      Target's out.

            Jesse fires up his '74 battered green PICK-UP TRUCK. He backs
            from the driveway and proceeds down the street.

                                BUD
                          (into radio)
                      Alright. Give him room.

            Bud's car starts and we move off with them...

                                BUD
                          (into radio)
                      We're mobile.

            EXT. STREETS - MINUTES LATER

            In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance.

            They pass an alley where a waiting BUICK falls in behind the
            Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside.

            INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:

            We see the truck slowing, angling into a TEXACO STATION.

                                SHEPARD
                      He's turnin' off.

                                BUD
                      Let's take him in the car.
                          (into radio)
                      Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your
                      backgrounds.

            INT. JESSE'S PICK UP - MOMENTS LATER

            Jesse stops at a pump. Suddenly, Bud appears at the window
            and jams a SHOTGUN against Jesse's head.

                                BUD
                      Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow
                      your head clean off.

            Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's BADGE swings from his
            neck. Jesse's eyes resign to relief. Bud SEES this...

                                BUD
                      Shut the car off slowly.

            With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from
            all directions, Jesse turns off his engine.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE - MORNING

            Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in
            unison around the house.

            Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard...

            Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays
            quietly inside. No one in the windows. 

            Shepard signals to Marandino...

            INT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE

            THE FRONT DOOR IS KICKED DOWN. Shepard and Marandino spill
            in, guns ready...

                                SHEPARD
                      POLICE! WARRANT!

            A pregnant woman in the kitchen... LYNN WHEELER, 30s. She
            SCREAMS, curses. Hurling dirty dishes fly like frisbees. 

                                LYNN
                      GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!

                                MARANDINO
                      MA'AM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!

                                SHEPARD
                      WE GOT A WARRANT!

                                LYNN
                          (more dishes)
                      FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

            Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor. A GUSH OF
            FLUID soaks through her dress. 

                                LYNN
                      Help... My baby...my baby...

            Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud
            lowers Lynn to the floor.

                                BUD
                          (to Cobb)
                      CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!

            BEDROOM - TIME CUT

            A door slams open to reveal...

            A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall.
            Windows taped over. Walls painted black.

            Military surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets.
            Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets.

            Bud in the doorway. Shepard joins him.

                                BUD
                      Toss everything.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

            Several COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open
            cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor...

            GARAGE

            Cobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench.

                                COBB
                      Alright, I want everything seized!

            Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold,
            blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere.

            LIVING ROOM

            COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25
            below a chair cushion.

            BATHROOM

            COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he
            removes a dripping .357.

            KITCHEN

            Several STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table.

            ATTIC

            Floor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES.
            ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES.

                                MARANDINO
                      Motherfucker's got a general store.

            LIVING ROOM

            Cops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a
            mounted A.C. He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a
            ziploc bag filled with DIAMONDS.

                                SHEPARD
                      God damn...there's some weight.

            KITCHEN

            Bud takes a seat at the table...

            For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold
            eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a
            boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS.

                                BUD
                      I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of
                      the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct.
                          (smiles)
                      So how you like Baton Rouge?

            Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly.

            Cabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor.

                                JESSE
                      What happened to my wife?

                                BUD
                      Water broke. She's en route to the
                      hospital.

            COP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if
            he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on...

            Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own...

            Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From
            inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS.

                                BUD
                      This is new.

            Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE."

                                BUD
                      What's the cyanide for, Jesse?

                                JESSE
                      Extracting impurities.

            Bud, right with him, grins.

                                BUD
                      Impurities from what?

            Jesse, calm. Deadpan.

                                BUD
                      You're in a bad situation here, pal.

                                JESSE
                      I'll make bond.

            Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it.

            BEDROOM

            Shepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans
            down to peer under the bed... 

            ...stops, stunned when he SEES: a row of live Goex charges in
            packing, boldly marked: EXPLOSIVES

                                SHEPARD
                          (top of his lungs)
                      OUT! EVERYONE OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            MIKE BRADDOCK (40s), Captain of Detectives, enters his
            office. Bud tows, carrying files.

                                BRADDOCK
                      What more do you want? You got a two time
                      felon on multiple counts. You got
                      robbery, B&E, you got an all-you-can-eat
                      felony fuckin' possession. All on top of
                      an organized burglary ring.

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. PROCESSING ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            ON A CAMERA FLASH. Mug shots of Jesse's front and profile.

                                BRADDOCK V.O.
                      The man's in custody, Bud. Fucked for
                      life. It's finished.

            Jesse's inked fingers are rolled onto an exemplar sheet.

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

                                BUD
                      There's more, I know it.

            Bud slaps a file on Braddock's desk, to a crime scene photo:
            An Asian JUDGE sits dead in the front seat of his car.

                                BUD
                      Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge
                      gets popped with a .357. Well I got a
                      Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it
                      through ballistics.

                                BRADDOCK
                      And?

                                BUD
                      It's a solid match! Dead on. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got
                      that burner. It don't prove a thing. 

                                BUD
                          (drops another file)
                      A stack of bonds taken from the home of a
                      Baptist Minister... 

            The crime photo: A black MINISTER and wife shot in bed.

                                BUD
                      Murdered. He and his wife. Looked like a
                      robbery gone to shit then; I want it
                      opened back up.

            INT. ANTE ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            A nude Jesse steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam.

                                BUD V.O.
                      I still got tests pending. More guns.
                      More cases. This guy ain't crazy, Mike.
                      He's a ticket to somethin' big. Somethin'
                      happening now.

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            Meanwhile...

                                BRADDOCK
                      So who's backin' him?

                                BUD
                      I don't know; I do know they'll post his
                      bond. That's why I need a price they
                      can't come up with overnight.

            Braddock listens. Bud keeps it on track...

                                BUD
                      I'm right about this, Mike.
                          (leans close)
                      When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years
                      and he ain't upset... It's like when your
                      wife is accusing you of fuckin' the
                      neighbor, but she don't know you're
                      fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty
                      calm about it, right?

            Braddock smiles slightly.

                                BUD
                      It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The
                      guns, the other shit, the time... He can
                      have that conversation. And he is. And he
                      ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact,
                      'cause we're fallin' short.
                          (the bottom line)
                      This guy knows things. He knows where
                      bodies are.

            Braddock, thinks; Then--

                                BRADDOCK
                      I'll bounce it up to the D.A.

            Bud grins, SLAMS his hand on the desk.

            INT. HOLDING AREA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

            Two GUARDS escort Jesse. He's bound in chains, orange scrubs. 

            INT. HOLDING CELL

            End of the hall. A BLACK PRISONER waits, arms slung over the
            crossbars with a cigarette. Jesse is brought forth.

            A Guard unlocks the cell. The Black Prisoner steps back,
            joining TWO OTHERS: All black, looming in the darkness.

            Jesse steps in. Guards unlock his shackles. Chains hit the
            floor. Behind him, the bars slam home.

            SILENCE...LONG, DRAWN SILENCE. THEN:

                                JESSE
                      My name is Jesse Wheeler... I'm now in
                      charge of this cell. Any y'all don't like
                      it, step your black ass forward, line up.

            A MOMENT. Cued by Jesse's challenge, each of the prisoners
            slowly rise, vehemently approaching...

                                                          CUT ABRUPT TO:

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

            And the phone RINGS...

                                BUD
                          (answers)
                      Yeah... 

                                MALE VOICE (OVER)
                      Bud? Charlie Bowers.

            WIDEN. Bud's house is sparsely furnished. Books on firearms
            and police work in stacks. As he reaches for a file...

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      Charlie... You had an inmate in '75,
                      named Jesse Wheeler.

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. OFFICE, MARION PENITENTIARY, ILLINOIS - NIGHT

            CHARLIE BOWERS, on an official phone. At Jesse's name, he's
            DEAD QUIET...

                                BUD
                      Charlie, you there?

                                CHARLIE
                      What's your interest in this guy, Bud?

                                BUD
                      Well, we got him on weapons and burglary.
                      But I got a feelin' there's more.

                                CHARLIE
                      Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots.
                      Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few
                      run-ins with him myself.

                                BUD
                      What else?

            INT. BEDROOM, BUD'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Bud lies in bed, wide awake. The PHONE CONVERSATION carries
            over...

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      You could say this is where he peaked.

            KITCHEN - DAWN

            Coffee pours into a mug. Then a shot of Irish Whiskey.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      He's a white supremacist. The worst kind,
                      if there is one.

            Bud, dressed now. The table is covered with various reports
            and photos from Jesse's file. BUD'S EYES guide us through...

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      Came in on armed robbery and assault...

            Bud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      But word in the system said, he's a
                      contract killer for the Aryan
                      Brotherhood.

            Photos of Jesse's tattoos: SUN-WHEEL on the shoulder; HELL
            HOUNDS around the biceps, THOR'S ELAPID covering his back.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      In here, the guy became an organizer...

            INT. BUD'S CAR, TRAVELING - MORNING

            Bud's face goes in and out of light and shadow.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      Controlling hits and movements inside the
                      system. Prison to prison. State to state.

            INT. LOWER FLOOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - MORNING

            Bud is walking with MURPHY, captain of the guards...

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo
                      Nazis, he unified the front...

            Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      All them prison gangs in the world...
                      Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it.
                      The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse
                      Wheeler was their ring leader.

            The PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently:

                                BUD
                      So what the fuck happened?

                                MURPHY
                      Processing ain't open till morning. We
                      threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we
                      even turn around, it's like we're back in
                      the fuckin' Alamo.

                                BUD
                      He attack the guards?

                                MURPHY
                      Guards are fine. But he took on three
                      niggers like they stole from him.

            Murphy stops outside a solid steel door.

                                MURPHY
                      I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it
                      happened, our block was the quietest it'd
                      ever been. Wish we had ten just like him.

                                BUD
                      Open the door.

            INT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS

            Bud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT.
            We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light.

                                BUD
                      Heard you refused a public defender.

            Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow.

                                BUD
                      At the gas station...When you were
                      arrested, I put a gun to your head.   
                      You expected someone else.

                                JESSE
                      You don't look like cops.

                                BUD
                      And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells
                      me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the
                      fridge, explosives...tells me you're
                      scared.

            Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him.

                                BUD
                      I know who you are.

                                JESSE
                      If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in
                      here alone.

            Bud smiles and walks to the door.

                                BUD
                      One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this
                      morning.
                          (grins)
                      There is no bond.

            HOLD on Jesse.

            Bud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud
            steps calmly out to the hall...

            The door shuts with a BOOM, locking Jesse in. And the nail in
            the coffin resonates.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

            Dim and desolate.

            INT. LOBBY, GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

            Grace buys a ticket, crosses the lobby to the men's room.

            INT. MEN'S ROOM

            Grace at the sink. He pats running water on his damaged face
            and straightens the bandage. 

            A TOILET FLUSHES

            the stall door opens and a man emerges. Lean and fierce, like
            an electric charge... CATFISH STANTON, 30.

            Grace FREEZES at the sight of Catfish, tightening his belt.
            Lets the water run...

                                CATFISH
                      Grace? That you?

                                GRACE
                      Hey there, Catfish...

            Catfish steps close, reaches a hand to Grace's face.

                                CATFISH
                      'The hell happened?

            Grace flinches. Catfish pauses, then SNIFFS his hand.

                                CATFISH
                          (smiles)
                      Oh... Excuse me.

            Catfish steps to the sink. Begins washing his hands.

                                CATFISH
                      So where you off to?

                                GRACE
                      Goin' to visit my mother. She's real
                      sick.

                                CATFISH
                      That's too bad. So you'll be gone a long
                      time then.

                                GRACE
                      Yeah...

            Another MAN suddenly enters. Large and imposing, neck tattoos
            ...BUZZ MCKINNON, 32.

                                GRACE
                          (swallows hard)
                      Buzz.

            Catfish turns off the water. THE BATHROOM IS SUFFOCATED WITH
            SILENCE.

                                GRACE
                      What can I do y'all for?

                                CATFISH
                      How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked
                      up? And you ain't?

                                GRACE
                      Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't
                      know nothin' about that. 

            Catfish GRINS. It's harsh. Blood curdling.

                                CATFISH
                      I heard different.

                                GRACE
                      Well there ain't no "different" to hear,
                      Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither
                      of 'em.

                                CATFISH
                      But you did talk to someone.

            Buzz moves. Grace turns to look...

            ...In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up: ONE QUICK POP. A .45
            with a thick, barrel silencer. The mirror shatters. Grace's
            knees hit the floor. His head hits the sink, HOLDS. As blood
            runs from one small hole.

            Catfish straightens up in the next mirror. Tucks his shirt.
            Grace's body sags to the floor. Catfish and Buzz walk out.

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            LOUD BUZZER. Two GUARDS #1 and #2 march Jesse down the tier.
            On his left, PRISONERS in cells, TURN, STARE and WHISPER. 

            Jesse arrives at a cell.

                                GUARD #1
                          (calls out)
                      Open ninety-six!

            BARS slide back. Jesse walks in. His CELL-MATE steps
            cautiously from the shadows... 

            IT'S RAY. Pale and nervous. Jesse stands over him. The
            brothers' eyes connect. And there's a moment...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. EXERCISE YARD, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard
            towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.

            Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.
            He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.

                                RAY O.S.
                      This place is bad...

            Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as
            he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder... 

                                RAY
                      There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a
                      sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I
                      talked.

            Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.

                                RAY
                      Just the other day... some spic fish got
                      hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they
                      beat him and stabbed him till there
                      weren't nothin' left. And the guards let
                      it happen.

            Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.

                                RAY
                      His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like
                      somebody painted 'em.

            Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.

                                JESSE
                      They come at you?

                                RAY
                      Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can
                      feel it fuckin' coming.

            Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the
            yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp
            looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.

            The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained
            face as the bar lands with a CRASH.

            INT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY,
            LATER 

            A long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate.
            Ray, behind Jesse. Says low:

                                RAY
                      Hey, Jesse... 
                          (silence)
                      Sorry I put you back here. I never meant--

                                JESSE
                          (turns)
                      "Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry.
                          (pause)
                      I took you into my home. I tried to clean
                      you up. And you steal from me...? You
                      take my fuckin' diamonds? 
                          (dead to rights)
                      'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my
                      son. 

            Ray swallows hard. Nothing he can say.

            INT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            CLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets,
            paperwork and photos.

                                BUD O.S.
                      Alright, let's work this...
                          (beat)
                      In prison, Wheeler is credited for the
                      expansion of the Brotherhood. When
                      Federal split up members, they had to
                      reorganize. So they tattooed their blood
                      types and serial numbers on one another.

                                COBB O.S.
                      Recede and multiply.

                                BUD O.S.
                      Exactly...

            REVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a
            table, used as a converted eating area. 

                                BUD
                      Put 'em in prison, they get stronger.
                      Everywhere you send one, they recruit in
                      numbers. Within five years, their numbers
                      were over ten thousand.

                                MARANDINO
                      Wheeler directed all that, huh?

            Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file.

                                BUD
                      What do you got there, Shep'?

                                SHEPARD
                      Interpol wired us files on three known
                      Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana:
                      Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this
                      man... Lucian Adams.

            He opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51.
            Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features. 

                                SHEPARD
                      High priest of the Aryan National Party.
                      His "ministry" of Christian Identity and
                      Paramilitary Order has stood for over a
                      decade. Check this out...

            Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot)
            Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound.

                                SHEPARD
                      Wheeler was just seventeen when he met
                      Lucian at the Patriotic Congress.

                                MARANDINO
                      No shit.

                                SHEPARD
                      Today, Lucian's one hell of an
                      entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores.
                      Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks
                      runnin' all across the God damn country.

            Bud's been quiet; says now:

                                BUD
                      Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I
                      need an angle.

                                COBB
                      For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news
                      would spread like wildfire. The AB's
                      gonna know about it. They'd gonna know
                      about it nationally.
                          (re: his coffee)
                      Pass the sugar.

            Marandino does.

                                BUD
                      That's if he was a surface informant. I
                      don't want him to testify. I want to keep
                      him on the street.
                          (to the group)
                      Look, this guy's been in it a long time.
                      He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his
                      hands free. I can feel it.

                                MARANDINO
                      Braddock ain't gonna go for this.

                                BUD
                      I'll handle that.

            Everyone looks to Bud.

                                BUD
                      We got one chance here. 'Cause if this
                      falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more
                      dead than alive.

            INT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING

            A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see.  

            Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN
            PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit.

            Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly
            sit across from the Wheeler brothers.

                                CZAPP
                      How you doin', Ray?
                          (off Ray's look)
                      We was just over there wonderin' why you
                      ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to
                      your kin.

                                RAY
                      I was gonna.

                                CZAPP
                          (grins)
                      I'm sure you was.

            Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up.

                                CZAPP
                      Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you...

                                ROACH
                      Fuckin-A, heard a lot.

                                CZAPP
                      Name's Czapp... You can call me,
                      "Bossman."
                          (beat)
                      I kept an eye on your brother the past
                      few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray?

                                RAY
                          (low)
                      Yeah...

                                JESSE
                      My brother ain't none of your business.

                                CZAPP
                      Ain't none of my business, "Bossman." And
                      everything in this fuckin' place is my
                      business.

            Ray nervously glances down at several Aryans watching...

                                CZAPP
                          (to Jesse)
                      Listen to me, you sonofabitch. I'm gonna
                      make one God damn thing God damn clear.
                      Your reputation is smoke. Whatever they
                      say you is or once was, I don't give a
                      flyin' fuck. 'Cause it's my say-so now.
                      And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs.

            Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table:

                                CZAPP
                      Y'all got that?!

            Suddenly Jesse SPRINGS. A headbutt EXPLODES Czapp's nose and
            throws him back.

            Czapp's head hits linoleum, echoing with a CRACK!! He lies
            still. Bloodied and unconscious.

                                ROACH
                          (stumbles away, shocked)
                      Fuck...

            A DEAFENING SILENCE SPREADS OVER THE CAFETERIA.

            Jesse calmly resumes eating. Czapp's blood covers his face.

            SUDDENLY AN ALARM BLARES. GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy.

            INMATES HIT THE DECK, arms behind their heads. All except
            Jesse, who continues to eat.

                                MURPHY
                      WHEELER!!! Stand the fuck up! Hands
                      behind your head! 

            Jesse rises.

                                MURPHY
                      Hands behind your head! Get on the
                      fuckin' floor!

            Jesse puts his hands behind his head, but does not kneel.

            Restraints are slammed on Jesse's wrists. And we...

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

            INT. ISOLATION, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATE NIGHT

            The door unlocks and drags open. Jesse turns, blinking
            painfully into the light ...Sees an imposing DUTY GUARD.

                                DUTY GUARD
                      Phone call.

            INT. GUARD STATION

            Jesse is led in. Duty Guard hits an extension button on a
            desk phone and offers the receiver...

            Jesse doesn't move.

                                DUTY GUARD
                      It's a secure line.

            Duty Guard walks out. Alone now, Jesse picks up the line...

                                JESSE
                          (into phone)
                      Yeah.

            A low, whiskey voice is HEARD over the line: LUCIAN ADAMS.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      Been a long time...

            Jesse shuts his eyes. There's a moment before he opens them.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a
                      lot of heat on this one.

                                JESSE
                      I don't want my brother touched.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                          (laughs faintly)
                      I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm
                      callin' about you...

            Jesse turns SLOW to find the Duty Guard watching him from the
            hall. Lights a cigarette, stares.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      You should have come to me sooner, Jesse.
                      None of this would have happened.

                                JESSE
                      I'm askin' you, Lucian. My brother ain't
                      a problem.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      Your brother's a fuck up.

            And Jesse's quiet... Dead quiet...

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      And Jesse... We may know what you can do.
                      But you know what we can do. Understand?

            Jesse hesitates, then Lucian hangs up. DIAL TONE.

            INT. BRADDOCK'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

            Room strewn with piles of casework. Bud, agitated, paces.
            Braddock, behind a desk. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're reachin', Bud. The leverage ain't
                      there.

                                BUD
                      It's there. It's gotta cook a little
                      longer, that's all.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Jesse won't so much as blink at doin'
                      life. The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the
                      ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure.
                          (beat)
                      There's no deal to be had.

                                BUD
                      C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on.
                      Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that,
                      he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't
                      tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.

            Bud pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                BRADDOCK
                      We need somethin' more.

                                BUD
                      Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it.

            INT. VISITOR'S GATE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security
            check. INFANT SON in her arms.

            VISITING AREA

            Wives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners.

            TABLE

            Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across
            from Jesse...

                                LYNN
                      Life. You know how fuckin' long that is,
                      Jesse?

            Lynn's hands are shaking.

                                LYNN
                      So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run?
                          (upset)
                      Your friends are comin' by the house.
                      Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin'
                      for the God damn phone to ring.

            Jesse is silent.

                                LYNN
                      You said we were done with this. That
                      they were out of our lives.

            The baby begins to CRY.

                                LYNN
                      We have no money, Jesse. Which means we
                      have no fucking food. ...Say something,
                      would you?

                                JESSE
                      It's gonna be okay.

                                LYNN
                      I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life...

            The baby WAILING now.

                                LYNN
                          (quietly crying)
                      ...For our baby.

            TIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless.

            As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away
            from his son, and glances up...

            Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching
            them...

            BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare.

            INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER

            A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She
            wipes her eyes, holding the baby.

            The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled
            clothes.

                                BUD
                      Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly
                      introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.

                                LYNN
                      I know who you are.

                                BUD
                      You have a ride home?

                                LYNN
                      We took the bus.

            Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter.

                                BUD
                      Take a cab.

            Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn.

                                BUD
                      'You need anything...anything at all. Be
                      sure to call me.

            They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an
            unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... 

            Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And
            the card.

            INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            A Guard buzzes Jesse through.

            PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out.
            Jesse walks past, enters...

            HIS CELL

            ...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk.

            Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He
            gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray...

                                JESSE
                      Ray...

            No response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder. 

                                JESSE
                      Raymond, take a look.

            Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded
            his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant.

            THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR...

            Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes.
            Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive
            frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying... 

                                                               TIME CUT:

            EXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

            Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance.

            INT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK

            Jesse sits in shadow. Alone. And it's still...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            AFTER HOURS

            Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound...

            His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN,
            rushing into his cell...

            A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in
            the jaw with a CRACK!!

            On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's
            head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

            A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot
            bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

            With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes
            MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

            The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down
            and Jesse sinks into their grip.

            HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS.

            More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his
            cell and take him down the tier.

            Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress
            overturns. Shelves crash.

            INT. TIER

            PRISONERS move to their bars, SHOUTING and JEERING as Jesse
            is wrestled down the STAIRS to...

            THE LOWER TIER

            Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a
            door into...

            A TUNNEL

            between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's
            dragged into darkness getting darker.

            A DOOR SLAMS OPEN...

            INT. READY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON

            ...THERE'S A FLASH OF LIGHT. We're in a windowless room.

            And Bud pouring coffee for two...

                                BUD
                      Want a cup of coffee?

            Jesse is handcuffed to the table. Guards are breathing hard.

                                JESSE
                      MOTHERFUCKER! This how you do things?

                                BUD
                      Yeah... When I want to talk to someone,
                      without giving the impression he's
                      cooperatin'.

            Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics. The Guards file out
            and shut the door.

            Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as
            he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...

                                BUD
                      You got a problem.

                                JESSE
                      Yeah, what's that?

                                BUD
                      To start with, you're lookin' at two
                      hundred years.

                                JESSE
                      I've done the time. I'll do it again.

                                BUD
                      I know you can do it. But can your
                      family?

            Jesse's face is tense. Unyielding.

                                BUD
                      Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're
                      sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St.
                      Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin'
                      it, "suicide". You and I both know that's
                      a load of shit.
                          (beat)
                      You do the time-- sure. And you never see
                      your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit
                      him. Your wife...plans...everything...
                      Gone.
                          (beat)
                      'Less you talk...to me.

            Jesse silent, a dark internal pause. He meets Bud's eyes
            across the table; then...

                                JESSE
                      Do you hate?

                                BUD
                      What?

            Jesse's sudden directness has caught Bud off-guard.

                                JESSE
                      Who do you hate the most? Blacks you
                      throw in prison?

                                BUD
                      ...I dislike what they represent in the
                      system. Not as a whole.

            And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."

                                JESSE
                      And you believe that by overthrowin'
                      Aryan nationalism and integratin'
                      races...polluted creeds, with us...You
                      believe you're solvin' somethin'?

                                BUD
                      I believe we survive by integrating
                      safety. Understanding hate, and how to
                      stop it.

                                JESSE
                      It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to
                      tolerate it.
                          (leans in)
                      Maybe you forget that, to justify what
                      you do for a living...

                                BUD
                      Are we still in prison, or we back at the
                      compound, havin' mass?

                                JESSE
                      You don't get it.

                                BUD
                      No, don't dictate to me what put you in
                      here, or question my intentions with your
                      overcooked revolution!
                          (beat)
                      'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I
                      even got to you! That's why you distanced
                      yourself. That's why you're out there
                      crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life
                      that ain't AB.

                                JESSE
                      In who I am, there's pressure! I work for
                      you, I won't need a lawyer, I'll need a
                      priest! My outside finance is gone... My
                      wife and son, their heads wind up
                      somewhere their bodies ain't! So tell me,
                      why the fuck should I get involved with
                      you?!

                                BUD
                      How about personal warranty?

                                JESSE
                      Warranty?!

                                BUD
                      Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of
                      the problem so long, you've forgotten
                      what the fuck that is!
                          (boaring in)
                      "Finance..." Your wife came here on a bus
                      to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is
                      that your outside fuckin' finance?!

            Beat. Jesse, taken back.

                                BUD
                      Let me give you a little insight, pal. As
                      to what I know... And what you think you
                      know.

            Bud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy B&W
            SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS in front of Jesse.

                                BUD
                      This is today...

            Photo #1: Outside Jesse's House. A distressed Lynn and the
            baby being led into a car by Catfish.  

                                BUD
                      Is that your house? That's your wife,
                      right? Who's this guy?

            Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish.

                                BUD
                          (off Jesse's look)
                      Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your
                      family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.

            Photo #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the
            baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on.

            Jesse finally averts his eyes... 

                                BUD
                      Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her
                      face. And your son. They look safe to
                      you?  
                          (a moment)
                      I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's
                      got! And the longer you're in here,
                      they're up for grabs.  

            ON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN...

                                BUD
                      So either you let that happen... Or I get
                      the judge to allow bond. This never sees
                      trial. And you work for me. 

            And that's where it hangs...

                                                                  BLACK.

                                JUDGE V.O.
                      Jesse Wheeler. Please rise...

            FADE IN:

            INT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY

            Jesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench,
            presides over this arraignment hearing:

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      You stand accused of forty counts of
                      burglary, twenty nine counts of felony
                      theft, possession of illegal firearms,
                      possession or dealing in unregistered
                      weapons, possession of a controlled
                      substance, manufacture and possession of
                      incendiary devices, and seventeen counts
                      of receiving stolen goods... How do you
                      plead?

            CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively
            dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:

                                KIERSEY
                      Not guilty, Your Honor.

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      Let's hear the arguments for bail.

            The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:

                                DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                      Your honor, this man is an habitual felon
                      as well as a flight risk. Our office has
                      overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is
                      not only guilty, but also a serious
                      threat to the community. The State
                      recommends that bail be denied.

                                KIERSEY
                      Your honor, my client deserves a
                      reasonable bail. He has every intention
                      of appearing and answering to all these
                      false charges. In addition, he is the
                      sole provider for his wife and newborn
                      child, who would suffer undo hardship if
                      this man were incarcerated.

            CUT TO Judge Ponder:

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      Bond is set at one million.

            THE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles:

                                KIERSEY
                      Congratulations.

            REVEAL BUD -- seated in back, watching the proceedings.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Lynn, asleep in bed... 

            INT. HALLWAY

            Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When
            Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back.

            AND THE PHONE RINGS...

                                JESSE
                          (answers)
                      Yeah...

            STATIC; he listens, then:

                                JESSE
                          (into phone)
                      Okay.

            EXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR
            waiting idyll on a dirt road. 

            INT. CAR - PRE DAWN

            A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights
            spin on and the car pulls away... 

            EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN

            Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out
            and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.

            On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm
            Mississippi. His back is to us. 

            Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.

                                MAN'S VOICE
                      How's your family?

            We realize now...It's Bud.

                                JESSE
                      Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't
                      here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I
                      did, 'cause certain people crossed the
                      line. They didn't keep their word.

                                BUD
                      Well my word counts.

            They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...  

                                BUD
                      I want a body, Jesse.

                                JESSE
                      How many you want?

            Bud finally looks at Jesse.

            EXT. BORROW PITS - DAWN 

            A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.
            Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.

            Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-
            LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.

            The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.
            Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.

            SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.

                                COBB
                      'The fuck is that?

            Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.

                                BUD
                      Yard dog. Relax.

                                SHEPARD
                      Where's this motherfucker taking us?

            Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.

                                JESSE
                          (directly to Bud)
                      Dig here.

            Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".

                                                                TIMECUT:

            EXT. JESSE'S BORROW PIT

            Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.

                                MARANDINO
                      Bud! We hit something!

            Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.

                                BUD
                      Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!

            Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.

            INT. STATE POLICE AUTOPSY ROOM - MID MORNING

            The "cold room". Bud and Braddock watch as two PATHOLOGISTS
            hose down the drums. The stench is horrible.

                                BRADDOCK
                      How long they been down there?

                                BUD
                      Jesse tells me six months.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by
                      now. Fuckin' worm food.

                                BUD
                      We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy
                      who put 'em there.

            BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.

            Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And
            immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.

            The room recoils from the fumes.

            INT. KITCHEN, JESSE'S HOUSE - DAY

            Lynn is putting dishes away. The baby nearby, sleeps quietly
            in a swing. Lynn gazes out the window...

            EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE

            Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...
            When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street. 

            Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.  
            It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.

                                CATFISH
                      'Bout time to get a new truck there,
                      Jesse.

            Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.

                                CATFISH
                      Good to see you out. A free man now.

                                JESSE
                      What's goin' on, 'Fish?

                                CATFISH
                      On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good
                      Lord ridin' shotgun, through another
                      glorious Louisiana mornin'.

            Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach. 

                                CATFISH
                      Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.
                      Fact, a lot of people are.  

            Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.

                                JESSE
                      You tell him I'll come by.

                                CATFISH
                          (no longer smiling)
                      That's good. I'll see you real soon then.

            As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being
            taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE.

            PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long
            lens camera, triggers snapshots. 

            INT. DINER - DAY

            Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons.

            Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with   
            MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney
            General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.

                                BUD
                      Hey, Mike.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch.
                      He's down from Washington. With the
                      Attorney General.

                                FITCH
                      Martin. Just call me Martin.

            Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case
                      for a Federal sponsor.

                                BUD
                      How long you been with the Attorney
                      General, Fitch?

                                FITCH
                      Just over a year.

            Bud looks at Braddock.

                                FITCH
                      I want to assure you my education and
                      experience is more than adequate to
                      handle a case of this potential.

                                BUD
                      Is that right...

            Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Why don't we get to the particulars?

                                FITCH
                      Right. Alright.
                          (clears throat)
                      To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need
                      something substantial. A bait. In the
                      Justice Department, we have this mission
                      statement... We decide who the target is,
                      what's the threat assessment, the cost
                      value, over what time table it's gonna
                      take place... Which target do we go after
                      first. We don't want to miss a big target
                      hitting a smaller target, you understand?

                                BUD
                      No.

                                FITCH
                      Well, exposing bodies has limitations.
                      Those people are dead. We can't retrieve
                      their lives.

            Bud blinks.

                                BRADDOCK
                      He means there might not be enough to
                      back Jesse.

                                BUD
                      Keep him on the street without
                      protection, he winds up dead.

                                FITCH
                      What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.
                      He'll need to present something that
                      separates him from those we're going to
                      arrest. If Jesse can't offer something
                      continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of
                      much help.

            Bud stares at Fitch. 

            A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. 

                                WAITRESS
                      Ready to order?

                                FITCH
                          (cuts in)
                      Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort
                      on the side.

                                WAITRESS
                      You'll take what?

                                FITCH
                          (curt)
                      It's a dressing. 

                                WAITRESS
                      Well...we got ranch, thousand island and
                      oil. Which one you want?

            Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:

                                BUD
                      Lost my appetite.

            And walks out.

            EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY

            Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They
            say nothing till they reach the car.

                                BUD
                      I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds
                      want to help, that's fine. But not him.

                                BRADDOCK
                      What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's
                      not your partner, Bud. This case is
                      beyond our capacity. It requires
                      resources we don't have.

            Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.

                                BUD
                      They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They
                      send us some kid with a year under his
                      belt?! He don't even know what state he's
                      in... You want him in charge?!

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're God damn right I do! You're out on
                      a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job
                      to make sure you get back!

                                BUD
                      This is bullshit.

                                BRADDOCK
                      That may be. What it ain't, is open for
                      discussion.

            Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.

            INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING

            A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a
            stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.

                                JESSE
                      Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I
                      could tell y'all things. Names.
                      Locations. What boat is movin' what
                      drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get
                      cut up and why. ...But what I got to know
                      is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear
                      your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's
                      right by me and keep my head from gettin'
                      shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,
                      you need me. You ain't got enough cops
                      with enough sense or enough time, to
                      clear them crimes that already been
                      committed and will be.
                          (pause)
                      Y'all need me... I got the devil's
                      address.

            REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

            Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.
            Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the
            wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.

            Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps
            forward, laughs nervously...

                                FITCH
                      Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,
                      for that. And thank you, everyone for
                      attending...
                          (tight)
                      Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve
                      a matter of custody--

                                FBI #1
                      We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.
                          (to the room)
                      It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those
                      bodies were transported over state lines.

            An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:

                                ATF #1
                      Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This
                      man's house was a factory, for Christ's
                      sake. ATF is taking this.

                                DEA
                      Those murders were drug related. DEA's
                      got to do follow ups.

                                SECRET SERVICE
                      He was printing counterfeit money. 
                      That's Secret Service.

            ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch
            tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...

                                JESSE
                      There's a hit list.

            Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...

                                FITCH
                      Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone
                      quiet!

            And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:

                                FITCH
                      A what?

                                JESSE
                      A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might
                      be one or two less now, I ain't sure.
                      Some could've already been gotten.

                                BUD
                          (to Braddock)
                      Now we're talkin'.

            FBI #2 approaches Jesse...

                                FBI #2
                      Why these twelve, Jesse?

                                JESSE
                      Different reasons. It ain't so much why
                      or what they done that matters. Pick any
                      one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on
                      salary.

            Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.

                                JESSE
                      And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...
                      You're Mr. Nokes, right?

            Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent 
            figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...

                                JESSE
                      First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?

                                NOKES
                      That's right.

                                JESSE
                      Well, last time I seen it...you was
                      number two on that list.

            It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.

                                NOKES
                      Can you fill us in on the rest of those
                      names, Jesse?

                                JESSE
                      Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta
                      make clear 'fore that happens.

                                NOKES
                      What's that?

                                JESSE
                      I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've
                      listened to these suits here, on who's
                      gonna take me in...
                          (beat)
                      I will die, go to hell and take all y'all
                      cocksuckers with me, if he--
                          (motions to Bud)
                      --tells me to.
                          (beat)
                      I want y'all to know that.

            Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a
            CHILL falls over the room.

                                NOKES
                          (to Bud)
                      How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?

            Bud simply nods.

                                NOKES
                      I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will
                      come out of our budget. Anyone has
                      pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.
                      I'll loan him out.

            Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a
            comfortable level...

                                NOKES
                      And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm
                      number two on that list. Who the fuck is
                      number one?

            The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            EXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY

            Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through
            sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.

            EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY

            Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates.

            A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second
            camera pans on Jesse, staring...

            MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. GUARD STATION - SAME

            A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits
            in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open.

            INT. JESSE'S TRUCK

            pulls down the private road.

            Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant
            VICTORIAN HOME. 

            Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing,
            shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.

                                BUZZ
                      Jesse.

            Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.

                                JESSE
                      I'm here to see Lucian.

            Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet.

                                CATFISH
                      He's busy right now; You can come in and
                      wait.

            INT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY

            CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER

            as Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room:

                                MALE VOICE
                      This operation of your's has become big
                      business. You need relationships now more
                      than ever...

            THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a
            leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. 

            Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.

                                MORRIS
                      ...We've done business successfully
                      before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger
                      scope now. I'm here today because I want
                      to represent you exclusively. You need
                      someone lobbying at a state level, as
                      well as in Washington. My organization
                      can provide both. We've got contacts that
                      you don't have and other people can't
                      get. Now, I'm aware that you have
                      multiple businesses... However you need
                      one go-to guy, so that all your ventures
                      stay coordinated and all transactions and
                      contracts are realized. I am that person,
                      Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

            LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.

                                KIERSEY
                      What's this going to cost us?

                                MORRIS
                      As a retainer, I want an advance of three
                      hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten
                      percent of whatever economic benefit I
                      bring to this organization.

                                KIERSEY
                      Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of
                      line.

                                MORRIS
                      If you want a quality global economic
                      plan, that's what you pay for-- 

                                LUCIAN O.S.
                      We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's
                      what it's worth.

            Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.

                                LUCIAN O.S.
                      The advance is a drop in the bucket. The
                      real money is the percentage. It's in
                      your interest to see it my way.

            Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:

                                MORRIS
                      You've got a deal.

            INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY

            Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then
            shrugs on his coat and leaves... 

            Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...

            INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE

            ...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable
            room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS.

            Jesse is not invited to sit.

                                LUCIAN
                          (to Kiersey)
                      Give us a minute.

            Kiersey walks out and shuts the door... 

            ON LUCIAN

            he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.

                                LUCIAN
                      You have a son now, right?

                                JESSE
                      Yeah...

            As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK
            SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.
            And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,
            "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.

                                LUCIAN
                      What'd you name him?

                                JESSE
                      I named him Ray.

            Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens
            cuff-links.

                                LUCIAN
                          (over his shoulder)
                      Heard the cops smacked you around inside.

                                JESSE
                      'Wasn't too bad.

            Lucian checks his hair.

                                LUCIAN
                      You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways
                      than one.

                                JESSE
                      Looks like you done just fine without me.
                      Business rollin' through the door.

            And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...

                                LUCIAN
                      Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time
                      to raise a family.
                      Time to straighten things out. 
                          (pause)
                      I gave you that time... Then safe jobs
                      start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans.
                      Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys,
                      they think it's niggers, gone widespread
                      on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all
                      professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.
                      Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.
                          (locked on Jesse)
                      I knew right then and there, only a white
                      respectable burglar could've done this.

            Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...

            ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of
            controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of
            tension fall heavily on the room.

                                LUCIAN
                      Jesse... With all the work you been
                      doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe
                      jobs, behind my back...
                          (predatory)
                      Where's the tribute to the greater cause?

            Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the
            desk...

            He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS.

                                JESSE
                      Like I said, I just needed time.

            Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.

                                LUCIAN
                      Well, even prophets stumble once in a
                      while.

            Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:

                                LUCIAN
                      It's a shame about your brother.

            As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between
            them...

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT

            Jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. Lynn
            in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. They're driving under
            the cover of darkness... 

                                LYNN
                      I don't understand. Why do we have to
                      leave the state? You're not tellin' me
                      something. You're not tellin' me a lot.

                                JESSE
                      It ain't safe here no more. You wanted
                      out? This is out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

            Marandino looks through BINOCULARS: As an electric fence
            slides back. Jesse's truck approaches, drives through.

            EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

            A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like
            rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a
            nearby car with Shepard and Cobb.

            Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they
            walk toward the plane...

            Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.

            OUTSIDE THE PLANE

            Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls
            her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them
            we cannot hear...

            Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the
            door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off...

            Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST...
            Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE... 

            ON JESSE

            now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...

                                JESSE
                      Lucian took the stones. Talked about
                      jobs. High-end, boxcar.

                                BUD
                      Your family's safe now.
                          (beat)
                      Let's go to work.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. JEWELRY STORE BASEMENT - NIGHT

            Several AB SOLDIERS stand watch as Jesse pushes a heavy, 10"
            drill through a jeweler's vault door... Jesse throws tumbler
            and relock mechanisms aside, reaches in... jewels, gems.

            EXT. PARKING LOT - BETWEEN CARS - NIGHT

            Bud and Jesse parked next to each other, trading info.

            E/I. VARIOUS HIDEOUTS - NIGHT

            AB counterfeiting bills... Printing press and metal plates...
            Hands stain bills with coffee grounds and cigarettes, then
            industrial dryers... Jesse at a table behind tall stacks of
            cash, inspecting, approving...

            INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

            Bud with Jesse. Info, names and written amounts.

            INSERTS: HANDS file serial numbers off guns... HANDS building
            silencers... loading guns in suitcases below false bottoms...

            EXT. PAY PHONES - NIGHT

            Jesse on the line... Bud on the other end, taking notes...

            INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

            AB Soldiers unload crates from trucks, "Chrysler Corp."...
            "Remington Firearms"... Antique furniture... Machinery...

            INSERT: A MONEY MACHINE counts large denominations of cash.

            EXT. BELOW AN OVERPASS - NIGHT

            Parked under the interstate. Bud looks over Jesse's info.

            EXT. NEW ORLEANS PORT - NIGHT

            A large fishing boat arrives. Numerous Fisherman load marlin
            onto refrigerated trucks... Catfish, Buzz, numerous AB start
            up the trucks... Jesse hands the Head Fisherman a canvas bag
            of cash... 

            PULL BACK to reveal Shepard, Cobb and Marandino on the roof
            of a neighboring port, snapping photos. Taking notes.

            E/I. ISOLATED BARN - NIGHT

            Trucks arrive. AB bring the marlin inside... Atop a crate,
            Jesse slices a marlin open, revealing kilos of cocaine. More
            marlins are cut. More cocaine.

            INT. METRO OFFICE - DAY

            Bud on the typewriter, hammering out Jesse's contacts and
            movements. Files piling on his desk.

            INT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT

            An organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest
            sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall.

            Bud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge.

                                                         MONTAGE OUT/TO:

            EXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY

            Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table.

                                KIERSEY
                      There's a variety of matters to discuss
                      today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial
                      starts next week. One of the jurors
                      reached out. He's asking six thousand up
                      front plus a job at four hundred a week.
                      That guarantees a hung jury with a push
                      for an acquittal.  

                                LUCIAN
                      Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the
                      trucking firm.

                                KIERSEY
                          (as he writes)
                      Construction on the building Morris
                      brought us, in south-east Florida, is
                      complete. Every unit sold. We should see
                      revenues of one point four million over
                      our original projections. 

            Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.

                                KIERSEY
                      Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle
                      East. They put a final offer on the
                      table. They'll fund our operation in
                      Louisiana if we agree to act on their
                      behalf. Political targets mostly, on the
                      basis of our approval...
                          (beat)
                      I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a
                      sample of their resources.

                                LUCIAN
                      "Final offer?" Demands... 
                          (beat)
                      Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for
                      it. By the time they realize, we'll have
                      our return.
                          (laughs to Jesse)
                      You believe they're travelin' all the way
                      to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LUCIAN'S BACK YARD - LATER

            Jesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive
            countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby.

                                LUCIAN
                      I want you runnin' point on this one...  

                                JESSE
                      I'll be honest, I was hopin' for
                      somethin' bigger.

                                LUCIAN
                      What do you got in mind?

                                JESSE
                      How 'bout a few of them heads off the
                      list?

                                LUCIAN
                      We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz.
                      What do you want to go back to that for?

                                JESSE
                      The money's worth twice this. Bring back
                      a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart,
                      it's thirty, right?

            Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny.

                                LUCIAN
                      Tell you what. Do this other thing we got
                      lined up...
                          (beat)
                      Then I'll give you that taste.

            EXT. HENDERSON INDUSTRIAL ZONE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

            Dark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

            HEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of
            government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES
            ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case:

                                FITCH
                      There's pressure from Washington. They
                      send compliments for Jesse's work. But
                      our primary concern is that list. I need
                      names we can protect.

                                BUD
                      We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.

                                FITCH
                      If Jesse can just get a direct order...
                      from Lucian to him, on a wire--

                                BUD
                      --A wire?! He just went back to work, you
                      want him to wear a fuckin' wire?
                          (beat)
                      Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's
                      phone, that's what you should do.

                                FITCH
                      He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get
                      would be inadmissable.

                                BUD
                      It's information, Fitch. 

            Fitch, annoyed, but staying on track.

                                FITCH
                      Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on
                      the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay.
                      He's disconnected from everything, like a
                      ghost. 

            Bud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A violent rainfall.

            AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the
            deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead.

            EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade
            is pulled back, allowing entrance...

            Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by
            a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS
            exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a
            converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE.

            Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge
            through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. 

            Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI
            AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS...

            Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth.

            Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with
            cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)
            reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... 

            ...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a
            moment.

                                JESSE
                          (low)
                      Catfish.

            Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a
            smile:

                                CATFISH
                      Go 'head. Count it.

            The Shiite leader, NASEEM, sees the strife.

                                NASEEM
                      There a problem?

                                JESSE
                      No problem. Money's all there.

            Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews
            watch closely...  

            ...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.

                                CATFISH
                      'The fuck you lookin' at...?

            The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go
            back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...

                                JESSE
                          (low)
                      Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This
                      ain't the time.

                                NASEEM
                          (to Catfish)
                      Yes, listen to your boss.

                                CATFISH
                      What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best
                      watch your ass, sand nigger.  

                                NASEEM
                      Piece of shit--!

            Everyone reaches for their guns. Threats SHOUTED in Arabic
            and English.

                                JESSE
                      Take it easy! Take it easy! 

            SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding
            the scene. Everyone turns.

                                A VOICE
                          (over a loud speaker)
                      ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!

            Omar reaches for the bag of cash...

            BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.

            And World War III erupts.

            AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout
            locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

            Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

            SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown
            apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

            ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

            Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then
            swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into
            the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

            Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is
            spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

            Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and
            PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

            Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and
            Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car
            CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

            Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.
            WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

            Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the
            stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

            The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it
            through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

            JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the
            construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

            ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...

            AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF

            lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering
            traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. DESOLATE FIELD - LATE NIGHT

            The moon hangs low as Jesse parks the Freight truck among
            tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.

                                                                TIMECUT:

            As Catfish exits the truck...

            ...Jesse takes Catfish's gun, grabs him by the neck and SLAMS
            him against the cab. FACE TO FACE.

                                JESSE
                      You're a piece of work, Catfish.

            Buzz grabs at Jesse; Jesse HURLS him to the ground.

                                CATFISH
                      Them niggers crossed the line...I had to
                      burn 'em--

                                JESSE
                      --You had to keep your mouth shut! On a
                      job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I
                      say!

                                CATFISH
                      'The fuck off me--!

            Jesse slams him back again. HOLDS his throat.

                                JESSE
                          (low, deadly)
                      Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave
                      you where I find you. Got that?

            PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes. 

                                JESSE
                      Unload the fuckin' truck.

            Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread
            truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join.

            INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS
            work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive...

                                FITCH
                      Keep your voice down! This was out of my
                      control!

                                BUD
                      I'm telling you, your agents best pull
                      their shit together! Who the hell y'all
                      trying to protect?!

                                FITCH
                      Look, Carter. This is a joint task force
                      with multiple agendas, that run up the
                      chain of command through me. Intel came
                      forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem
                      Kazuri - an international arms dealer -
                      would be present at this meet. ATF was
                      tasked to observe and report. 

                                BUD
                      That ain't what they did--!

                                FITCH
                      --No! Because your informant--

                                BUD
                      My informant, that's right!--

                                FITCH
                      --Your informant and his psychopath crew
                      greased half our political interests --
                      over a bag of fake cash! You weren't
                      informed, so what?

                                BUD
                      Well I better be informed! 'Cause this
                      ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all
                      got a collaborative agenda in the works?
                      I want to see it. These other agencies,
                      what time-lines they lookin' at? What
                      deadlines and why?

                                FITCH
                      Above your pay-grade--

                                BUD
                          (overlapping)
                      And is there a purposeful lack of
                      communication between competing agencies,
                      who are right now charting future
                      mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!

                                FITCH
                      That's not your concern, Carter!

            Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room...

                                BUD
                      We're not talkin' about me!!

                                BRADDOCK
                      Bud!

                                BUD
                          (spins)
                      What?!

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're over-involved here.

            And Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the
            eyes, so there's no doubt...

                                BRADDOCK
                      I'll handle this.

            Bud, red with anger, walks out. 

            Braddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved...

                                FITCH
                      Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been
                      berating my agents for the last hour.

            Braddock pours a cup of coffee.

                                FITCH
                      We're trying to band-aid a situation
                      here, and frankly, Carter's preference
                      for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all
                      be in my report...

                                BRADDOCK
                          (interrupts)
                      "Isn't helping?"

            A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in...

                                BRADDOCK
                      "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what
                      happened here, Fitch. We work for the
                      same cause doesn't mean we work for you.
                      What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse
                      back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter
                      delivered the biggest informant in the
                      history of this state to your lap, and
                      you and the people you work for are gonna
                      let it go to shit.
                          (beat)
                      You can expect that will be in my report.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

            STEELWORKERS warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs.
            The seven story furnace is deafening.

            ENTRY AREA

            Lucian is met by Kiersey. They walk together through glassed
            in hallways to a closed office door. 

            Lucian keys in, REVEALING a disheveled Morris seated in a
            chair with two large AB Soldiers on either side.

            INT. STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN

            Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris.

                                MORRIS
                      Look. I had no previous knowledge of any
                      business with Muslims. So if stealing me
                      here in the middle of the night, is some
                      kind of accusation--

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I
                      do find it interesting that right about
                      the time I employ you, my operation
                      starts having problems.

                                MORRIS
                      Yes, but--

                                LUCIAN
                      That is interesting...isn't it?

            Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely.

                                LUCIAN
                      I want to know if this was an isolated
                      incident. If the ATF impeding on my work
                      is the result of a deeper threat.

                                MORRIS
                      What are you suggesting?

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm suggesting you contact your friends
                      in Washington.

                                MORRIS
                      With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's
                      not what I was retained for.

                                LUCIAN
                      Well now it is.

                                MORRIS
                      That sort of information requires
                      clearance I don't have. If I start
                      sniffing around, people are going to ask
                      questions.

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm
                      getting impatient.

            Morris gets stone quiet. Lucian hands him a phone.

                                LUCIAN
                      You don't leave here till I get answers.

            And like that, this conversation is over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LIQUOR STORE + PHONE BOOTH - DAWN

            Off a deserted street. A DENSE FOG resides, far as the eye
            can see. And Jesse, in a PHONE BOOTH, drops a dime and
            dials...

                                LYNN V.O.
                          (clearly asleep)
                      Hello...

                                JESSE
                      It's me.

                                LYNN V.O.
                      You okay?
                          (off Jesse's silence)
                      Honey, you alright?

                                JESSE
                      I'm okay. Just need to hear your voice.
                      How's little Ray...?

                                LYNN V.O.
                      I'll put him on.

            SILENCE for a moment...then a quiet baby's voice. 

                                LYNN V.O.
                      It's daddy on the phone, say hello.

            Emotion rises to Jesse's face. He holds it in, barely.

            ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET 

            a lone CAR is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past... 

            ...Jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it. 

                                LYNN V.O.
                      Jesse?

            He hangs up. 

            A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He
            slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his
            truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's
            locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck.   

            THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness
            -- steps Bud -- ready to pounce... 

                                BUD
                      Where the hell you been?
                          (Jesse's look)
                      Two days missin', you broke protocol.
                      Three, and you're a flight risk.
                      Agents'll hunt your ass down.

                                JESSE
                          (anger spiking, pacing)
                      I can't keep doin' this. I can't fuckin'
                      breathe. Even the shadows got eyes.    

                                BUD
                      This is the job. If I don't hear from
                      you, I can't protect you.   

                                JESSE
                          (in his face)
                      Protect me?! I about got my head fuckin'
                      shot off, 'cause your guys was
                      "protecting" me!

                                BUD
                      Those ain't my guys!

                                JESSE
                      I don't give a fuck-- I don't want your
                      protection! I want out!

                                BUD
                      There is no "out." Not for either of us.
                      Not till it's done...
                          (low, definitive)
                      Get me that list.

            Jesse STARES -- a malevolence in his eyes that freezes Bud to
            the spot. Then, Jesse climbs in his truck and drives off.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Bud pacing; Braddock sits at his desk.

                                BUD
                      I'm losin' him, Mike...

                                BRADDOCK
                      Just relax. We gotta let things settle,
                      that's all. 

                                BUD
                      It ain't gonna settle, it's gonna blow. I
                      can feel it.  

                                BRADDOCK
                      What do you want me to do?

                                BUD
                      Push 'em back. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      Who?

                                BUD
                      The Feds. All these suits, fuckin'
                      outsiders. Everyone. Get me some room.
                      Some time to reel this thing in. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      I'll talk to Nokes. 'See what I can do.

                                                                  BLACK.

            INT. OFFICE, STEEL MILL - DAY 

            Morris (a nervous wreck, unshaven) sits across from Lucian.
            Kiersey at an adjacent table.

                                MORRIS
                      There's an investigation underway, funded
                      by the U.S. Attorney. And you're the
                      target.

            Morris opens his briefcase and hands over a pair of dossiers.

                                MORRIS
                      They're receiving assistance from both
                      the ATF and FBI, who are stationed right
                      here in Henderson.

                                LUCIAN
                          (pause)
                      How long they been active?

                                MORRIS
                      My sources tell me three months.

            Lucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier.

                                LUCIAN
                      Three months...

            Lucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of AB activity
            goes by in a blur. Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring. 

                                KIERSEY
                          (reading)
                      This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the
                      helm. He's been after us for years.

                                LUCIAN
                      Who they got for a mouthpiece?

                                MORRIS
                      A "mouthpiece"?

                                LUCIAN
                      Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the
                      fuck's giving 'em information?

                                MORRIS
                      I couldn't dig that deep. But it's
                      someone close.
                          (pause)
                      I suggest you gentlemen disband.

            INT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse, alone in the dark, seated on the couch... There's a
            SOUND outside... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Jesse moves soundlessly through the house, gun ready, toward
            the back door.

            JESSE'S POV: as the door opens slow, HE/WE SEE ON THE PORCH: 

            LUCIAN

            seated comfortably in a chair... 

                                LUCIAN
                      Couldn't sleep.

            Jesse looks to the darkness. Dogwood trees. Thick growth.
            EERIE SILENCE...

                                JESSE
                      Got somethin' on your mind? 

                                LUCIAN
                          (without looking at him)
                      There's been an adjustment to the list,
                      Jesse...

            Jesse's silent. YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE...

                                LUCIAN
                      We got this...heathen. A whore of an
                      Irishman...down in Baton Rouge.
                      He's protected. Got a lot of guys around
                      him. That's why it pays. That's why
                      nobody wants the job... That's why we're
                      here talkin'.

                                JESSE
                      Who is it?

            Lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address
            written on back. 

            Jesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform. 

                                LUCIAN
                      This cop... he's got a mouthpiece...
                      somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who.
                      In the meantime, shut him down.

            ON JESSE, a frozen moment. He forces out the words:

                                JESSE
                      It's done.

            With that, Lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into
            darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            JESSE'S TRUCK heading up the INTERSTATE, crossing into EAST
            BATON ROUGE, then driving through dark RESIDENTIAL STREETS of
            Bud's neighborhood...

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK - LATE NIGHT

            He pulls to the curb, parks. Jesse racks a MOSSBERG SG, loads
            it with solid shot, then lays the gun on his lap. 

            THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Bud's house in the distance.

            And Jesse sits there, several moments...WAITS...BREATHES...
            Then he exits the truck...

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse moves -- fast, soundless -- toward the house. With his
            shotgun, scales the fence, as we--

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. DOWN THE STREET, BY JESSE'S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

            A VAN arrives, stops. No headlights, two hundred yards from
            the house. INSIDE THE VAN: Catfish and Buzz. Several AB
            SOLDIERS in back, armed to the teeth.

                                BUZZ
                      That's his truck.

                                CATFISH
                          (nods)
                      Let's see what he does.

            The motor ticks and ticks and...

            EXT. SIDE YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            It's dark, quiet; but the muted glow of a tv in the living
            room. JESSE MOVES IN SHADOW, shotgun leading... He stops.
            LISTENS... 

            WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HARD WATER FROM A SINK OFF-SCREEN

            ...Jesse moves toward it...

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Catfish, Buzz, the soldiers watching Bud's house intently.

                                CATFISH
                      The fuck's takin' so long? 
                          (beat)
                      I would've shot that pig dead already...
                      'made a pulled-pork sandwich.

                                BUZZ
                      Give him a minute. That's a cop, lives
                      there. 

                                CATFISH
                          (checks his watch)
                      I'll give him two.

            Catfish, loading his gun, as--

            EXT. YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Through a window, WE SEE Bud washing dishes. Then, slipping
            INTO FRAME...

            JESSE

            watching him. Pulse pounding, his mind on overdrive, trying
            to untangle identity and consequence... Then...

            He taps the window, and Bud looks up...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            THE BACK DOOR

            Bud opens it:

                                BUD
                      Jesse. 'The hell you doin' here?

                                JESSE
                      You been made, Bud. We gotta skin out.

                                                                BACK TO:

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Catfish, anxious now, racking his gun again and again.

                                CATFISH
                      Somethin's wrong... 

                                BUZZ
                      Relax, Catfish. You said two minutes.

                                CATFISH
                      Fuck you, man! This don't feel right.

                                BUZZ
                      Just give it a second. 
                          (to soldiers in back)
                      A few more seconds, right guys?

            Catfish, breathing hard, bent on bloodshed...

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT 

            Bud quickly dials the phone --

                                SHEPARD V.O.
                          (over phone, answers)
                      Yeah.

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      Hey. Meet me at the office in ten
                      minutes. Cobb and Marandino too.

                                SHEPARD V.O.
                          (over phone)
                      Why, what's up?

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      I'll explain later. Just get there. Now.

            QUICK CUTS as Bud hangs up, shoves a .38 in his waistband.
            Slams a clip and holsters a 9MM.

                                BUD
                          (to Jesse)
                      Let's hit it.

            Bud and Jesse start for the door...

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT 

            AB Soldiers loading their guns. 

            CATFISH

            starts the engine; POV THRU THE WINDSHIELD: Jesse and Bud,
            leaving the house.

                                CATFISH
                      That's them! Together, you see?!

                                BUZZ
                      I see 'em--

                                CATFISH
                      You see?! They're fuckin' dead!

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse hurries down the lawn. Bud to his Chevy.

            SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF TIRES BURN... CATFISH'S VAN SEARS DOWN
            THE STREET...

            ...THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AS AB SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE FROM SUB
            MACHINE GUNS. 

            Jesse drops behind a neighbor's sedan.

            Bud dives behind the Chevy. ROUNDS SLAM through sheet metal,
            interior, and out the other end. 

            AB Soldiers exit the van, spread and keep FIRING. Jesse's
            sedan takes hits. WINDOWS AND TIRES EXPLODE. 

            Bud and Jesse aim over their roofs. Take and RETURN FIRE. 

            Catfish emerges, kneels and pumps SHOTS into Bud's Chevy.

            The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART -- Shattered glass covers Bud.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SHEPARD'S CAR, TRAVELING - LATE NIGHT 

            Shepard at the wheel. We hear dispatch on the police scanner:

                                DISPATCHER V.O.

                                SHEPARD
                      What the fuck?

                      --Units please respond...

            Shepard hits the BRAKES, peels a hard U-turn and SLAMS the
            gas toward Bud's house...

                                                                BACK TO:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Buzz rounds the van and OPENS FIRE.

            Jesse and Bud cover. Their eyes connect. Bud signals towards
            the house. Jesse nods...

            ...then lays cover fire with the Mossberg. AB #3 is spun and
            thrown. 

            Bud, under fire and firing back, races back into the house.

            Jesse keeps FIRING.

            I/E. BUD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

            Bud YANKS an M-16 from the closet and slams the door.

            OUTSIDE

            Jesse, on his knees, pulls a secondary .45 from his waistband
            and fires over the hood of the sedan.

            CATFISH FIRES HIS SHOTGUN AND JESSE'S HAND EXPLODES IN HALF.

                                JESSE
                          (crumbles hard)
                      Fuck!

            Jesse hits the dirt, WRIST PUMPING BLOOD.

            AB #4 and #5 move in for the kill, when out of nowhere --
            SHEPARD'S CAR SPEEDS ON SCENE -- His door kicks out; SHEPARD
            PUMPS SHOTS, EXCHANGING.

            Buzz comes up from behind, aims -- BULLETS FLASH AND PUNCH
            THROUGH SHEPARD.

            INSIDE THE HOUSE 

            Bud swings the M-16 through the glass and BLASTS AWAY,
            killing AB #4, as Jesse staggers toward the house, holding
            his wrist...

            ...and DIVES inside, then kicks the door shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

            Catfish, Buzz and AB Soldiers flank the house.

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

            On the floor, Jesse rips out his belt, a tourniquet around
            the armpit. He holds it with his teeth and ties his arm.

            Bud reloads and slides Jesse a .357 Python. Jesse takes it up
            with his good hand.

            Suddenly in the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES DISCHARGE.
            THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS EXPLODE. Bud ducks, scrambles, as
            rounds splinter the wall. 

            A BACK KITCHEN DOOR is bashed open and AB #5 steps in,
            BLAZING SHOTS.

            Bud lets fly -- FIRING. Big bore rounds punch through AB #5.
            His insides hit the wall. 

            WE NOW HEAR DISTANT POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING...

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET - SAME

            A LONG-HAIRED AB on the lawn fires dozens of shots from an  
            M-1.

            Catfish and Bud exchange CROSSFIRE as...

            ...Buzz starts up the van and Catfish jumps in, followed by
            Long-Hair...

            I/E. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET

            Bud runs out to the street, M-16 FIRING at the fleeing van.

            Bullets shatter the back window as the van speeds around the
            corner through garbage cans and a residential fence...

            ON BUD

            standing there. He turns, and STOPS when he SEES...

            SHEPARD

            inert, bullet-ridden.

                                BUD
                      Shepard!
                          (runs over)
                      No...

            Bud holds his partner, horrified. Around them, bodies on the
            lawn. Disabled vehicles. Doom overlays the property.

                                                                TIMECUT:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

            Pandemonium as the street is clogged with POLICE VEHICLES and
            MEDIC UNITS. Braddock arrives with Cobb and Marandino.

            Bud moves alongside a PARAMEDIC wheeling a gurneyed Jesse,
            with a pressure bandage and splint, onto an ambulance.

                                BUD
                          (turns to Braddock)
                      We run 'em now, Mike. Right fuckin' now!

                          (nods)
                      What do you need?

                                                               SMASH TO:

            E/I. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - PRE DAWN

            A huge BATTERING RAM knocks it right off the hinges. SWAT,
            Bud rush in with rifles...

            ...Room by room. Everyone clears. The house is empty.

                                SWAT #1
                      Nothing.

            E/I. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

            SWAT TEAMS have secured the premises. Two HELICOPTERS sweep
            the grounds via SPOTLIGHT. A manhunt for Lucian Adams.

            INSIDE, Cobb on his radio: 

                                COBB
                      No one here, Bud...

            INT. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Bud listens on his radios as SWAT OFFICERS file out of the
            vacant house.

                                COBB V.O.
                          (radio filter)
                      Empty. 

            Bud stands there, infuriated...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. TRAUMA CENTER, OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

            Jesse, unconscious in bed, with IV lines re-infusing plasma.
            Bud is with a DOCTOR, who washes his hands in a sink...

                                DOCTOR
                      His bleeding's under control. There's
                      tissue damage. Projectile fragmentation
                      in the right forearm. We have most of it
                      removed. Two fingers are gone. A portion
                      of the palm. There's no chance of
                      reconstruction.
                          (Bud's silence)
                      I'll be monitoring his vitals.

            Doctor walks away. Bud turns as a NURSE dims the lights and
            pulls the curtains, obscuring Jesse...

            I/E. OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

            Bud, absorbed, walks past crowded emergency room activity...

            OUTSIDE

            Braddock is waiting. 

                                BRADDOCK
                          (stares for a moment)
                      You have to let go now.

            Bud says nothing.

                                BRADDOCK
                      It's over.

                                BUD
                      It's not.

                                BRADDOCK
                          (in his eyes)
                      The cover's blown. Lucian's gone. There
                      ain't nothin' left on this one.

            Bud, hearing it. Feeling every bit of it.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Get to a safe-house, Bud. 
                          (hands Bud a set of keys)
                      'Squad car over there is your's.

            Braddock walks off. Bud watches him go.

            INT. SQUAD CAR, TRAVELING - DAWN

            Bud drives in dark silence. As the hospital recedes, Bud
            pulls a flask from his coat, takes a drink...

                                                                  BLACK.

            SHEPARD'S FUNERAL. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN saluting as a PRIEST
            gives the eulogy. 

            BUD 

            at the gravesite, with Braddock, Cobb and Marandino. A salute
            is FIRED with rifles.

            LATER

            Bud stands alone. Dry-eyed, vacant stare.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police
            secure a crime scene: Richard Morris sits dead at the wheel
            of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood.  

            IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb.

                                COBB
                      ...His cranium was smashed with a lead
                      pipe. Then the plastic bag. He choked to
                      death while it filled up with blood.

                                BUD

                      lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington.

            Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards --
            Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one:

            "Daniel J. Kiersey, Attorney at Law" 

                                BUD
                      Put a tap on that line.

                                COBB
                      Braddock ain't gonna like it.

                                BUD
                      Do it.

            Braddock arrives on scene. Disturbed expression:

                                BRADDOCK
                      Bud. I just got off with Nokes.

                      We got a problem.

            There's a KNOCK O.S.

            Jesse looks up to see Bud enter from the hallway.

                                BUD
                      Give us a minute, Doc.

            LABORER #1 steps INTO FRAME with a STOP SIGN.

                                LABORER #1
                          (approaches Tom's window)
                      Wait here a moment, sir.

            A crane moves past, hoisting steel. Tom IDLES the engine.
            Then:

                                LABORER #1
                          (gestures)
                      Thanks for waiting. Go ahead.

            Tom drives onward, glancing in the REARVIEW: at Laborer #1
            watching them pull away, receding in the distance...

            INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

                                JESSE
                      Get me out of here, Bud. I want to see my
                      family.

            Bud, the pit in his stomach widening, struggles to say:

                                BUD
                      There is no family.

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK 

            Tom - calm and alert - looks to his right - SEES a child's
            BICYCLE parked on the sidewalk. A BACKPACK affixed to the
            handlebars... 

            EXPLODES

            A MASSIVE GOEX BLAST IN TWO DIRECTIONS. HITS THE CAR'S REAR
            DOOR, CUTTING STEEL.  

            WINDSHIELDS OF PARKED CARS SHATTER. NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES. THE
            CAR IS BLOWN SIDEWAYS AND WRAPS AROUND A LIGHT POST. 

            THE CAR'S FRONT DOOR DROPS OPEN AND TOM CRAWLS OUT. CHARRED.
            BURNING. LAST GASP OF LIFE.

            EXT. ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

            A CARGO VAN pulls up and parks. The Labor Team abandons it,
            dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags,
            REVEALING: A CREW OF AB SOLDIERS LEAD BY CATFISH. 

            The bags go in the back of a waiting SUBURBAN. Catfish takes
            the wheel. The crew climbs in, drives away. 

                                                                BACK TO:

            INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

            ON JESSE. Absorbing this. His face begins to tremble. Eyes
            press shut. They fill with moisture as he looks away.

            HOLD ON BUD. Quiet. Struggling to hide his own emotion. 

                                BUD
                      I'm sorry...

            And he walks out.

            INT. HALLWAY, REHABILITATION WARD

            MOVING WITH BUD, as he heads for the exit. Under harsh
            fluorescents...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

            Pouring rain.

            It's a madhouse outside. A crowd is gathered around a police
            action in progress. MEDICS are tending to the broken nose of
            a bartender (PETE) in his 30s. METRO COP #1 stands by. 

            A car pulls up and Cobb gets out with Marandino. They
            approach the bartender.

                                BARTENDER
                          (to Metro #1)
                      He's out of his mind. 'Asked him to slow
                      down; and he punched me in the face.

            Cobb and Marandino approach.

                                COBB
                          (to bartender)
                      Hey, Pete. You alright?

                                BARTENDER
                      I'm alright. The bar ain't. 

                                MARANDINO
                          (to Metro #1)
                      We'll smooth it out. Clear the street.

            Cobb and Marandino start toward the bar.

            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

            The place is A MESS. Chairs broken, tables overturned. Music
            BLARES on the jukebox. And empty except Bud... three sheets
            to the wind, drunk. Pacing the ruins with his 9MM in hand...

                                BUD
                      Y'all fuck with me? Huh? You want to fuck
                      with me?

            Cobb and Marandino peer in the doorway to see Bud, shouting
            and threatening a vacant chair.

                                COBB
                      Jesus Christ.

            Bud flips another table. Continues talking to the chair as if
            someone were in it. 

                                BUD
                      'Look at me when I talk to you.
                          (aims his 9MM)
                      You try and kill me? You like killin'
                      women and kids?

            Bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair.

                                COBB O.S.
                      Bud...

            Bud spins, glass-eyed and red-faced. His wavering vision can
            barely make out Cobb and Marandino approaching...

                                MARANDINO
                      Easy, Bud... Easy...  

                                COBB
                      We got you here, Bud... It's just us.
                      Hear me?

            Bud stands his ground, tries to keep his balance...

                                COBB
                      Let's go home...

            There's a long moment. Bud stares at his crew, gone. Then
            he's suddenly overwhelmed with emotion...

            INT. REHABILITATION WARD - MORNING

            Two FBI AGENTS #4 and #5 walk together down this sterile
            corridor. They stop outside Jesse's closed door. A uniformed
            POLICE OFFICER is posted there, reading a newspaper. 

                                FBI #4
                      We're here to escort Mr. Wheeler.

                                POLICE OFFICER
                          (holds up a chart)
                      Sign this.

            FBI #4 signs the chart. The two agents enter...

            INT. JESSE'S ROOM

            Jesse's bed is empty. The window open. Curtains billowing.

                                FBI #4
                      Check the bathroom.

            FBI #5 opens the bathroom door. Empty. Both Agents hurry to
            the window, SEE OUTSIDE: A large TREE six feet out from the
            ledge and a broken branch at street level. A seemingly
            impossible escape route.

                                FBI #4 (CONT'D)
                      Sonofabitch. This guy's crazy.

            INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - MORNING

            A badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous
            agents around a conference table. 

            NOKES

            walks the room, says to all:

                                NOKES
                      This is an atrocity, gentlemen.
                      Incompetence at it's highest level. I
                      gave you my name. My resources. My
                      trust...Carte blanche. And now this
                      handsome face of mine...can't step foot
                      in Washington, for fear of being laughed
                      off the Hill.

            Nokes circles behind Bud...

                                NOKES
                      Now, I'd love to point to Local on this.
                      But truth is, they've carried their
                      weight. We are federally fucked... 
                          (looks right at Fitch)
                      Because Federal fucked up.

            Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard.

                                NOKES
                      So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of
                      command? Point of procedure? I don't give
                      a fuck. That's out the window, just like
                      our informant... 
                          (beat)
                      I want Jesse Wheeler found. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HALLWAY, FEDERAL BUILDING

            As everyone files out. Braddock says low to Bud:

                                BRADDOCK
                      You smell like a fuckin' distillery, Bud.
                      Clean up... 'find your boy.

            ON BUD. Tired eyes. Everything else, and now this...

            INT. STORAGE GARAGE - DAY 

            A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in.

            A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement.

            Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked
            in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS.

            Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge
            Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with
            pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck
            Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag.

            Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a
            grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers,
            shaves his scalp and mustache. 

            Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the
            trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. BAYOU GHOULA - NIGHT

            A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou.
            Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays.

            INT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED
            METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere.

            There's a METALLIC BANG O.S.

            Long-Hair looks up.

            The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat,
            slowly approaching...

                                LONG-HAIR
                      Who's there?

            Sudden surprise as the screen SNAPS OFF and a SILHOUETTE
            breaks the glass, opens it.

                                LONG-HAIR
                      What the fuck?!

            Long-Hair RUSHES for the door as THE BUTT OF A 12-GAUGE SLAMS
            DOWN LIKE A TOMAHAWK.

            Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream.

            Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on
            the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            The front lights go out. A terrible darkness.

            INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in.
            Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

            They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing
            LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each
            step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under
            a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward,
            reaches the doorway, creeps through...

            INT. BEDROOM

            The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the
            bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau.

            As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.
            Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once.   

            The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.
            Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

            The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

            Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo
            explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

            Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker.

                                JESSE
                      Get out.

            The Hooker does.

            INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

            Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet
            tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun.

            The boat rocks gently.

                                JESSE
                      We got some shit to discuss.

            Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated:

                                BUZZ
                      Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler.

                                LONG-HAIR
                          (top of his lungs)
                      I need a doctor! I need a fuckin' doctor!

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to
            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING
            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

                                BUZZ
                      FUCK! FUCK! OH, FUCK!

                                JESSE
                      House call.

            Jesse YANKS Buzz up. His chair rocks upright, into place.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?!

                                BUZZ
                      I don't know!

            Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head. Neck
            snaps. Teeth rattle.

                                BUZZ
                      NO ONE KNOWS WHERE LUCIAN IS! NO ONE
                      KNOWS-

            Jesse strikes again, connects. Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes
            swollen purple slits. His skull gushing red.

                                BUZZ
                      ...fuck...

            Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw.

                                JESSE
                      Who killed my family?

                                BUZZ
                      Ah shit, man!

            Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger. SHOT REVERBS
            HARD. Buzz SCREAMS, hysteria. 

                                JESSE
                          (racks another shell)
                      WHO KILLED 'EM?! CATFISH?!

                                BUZZ
                      CATFISH, YES, YEAH! FUCKIN' CATFISH!

            Jesse puts down the shotgun. Pulls from his gym bag, two CANS
            OF GASOLINE, one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face.

                                BUZZ
                          (flinches)
                      The fuck is that?
                          (sniffs, realizes)
                      WAIT, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?!

            Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair.

                                BUZZ
                          (thrashing)
                      NO! NO, NO, NO, DON'T!! DON'T!!

            As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead
            aim...FIRES.

            THE MUZZLE FLASH. GASOLINE IGNITES. BUZZ GOES UP IN FLAMES.

            Instantly, a FIRE ERUPTS. Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses BURN.

            Jesse empties the other can of gas, FEEDING THE FLAMES. THE
            FIRE SPREADS. BURNING THE WALLS. THE FLOOR AND CEILING.

            Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his
            face. For a moment, it's a vision in hell.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT, BAYOU GHOULA - PRE DAWN

            Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE
            BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water.

            Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being
            questioned by Marandino.

            Bud and Cobb stand apart. 

                                COBB
                      We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty
                      eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's
                      he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through
                      the front door.   

            Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS
            barge forward.

                                FITCH
                      Carter! We need to talk. 

                                BUD
                      Get out of my way, Fitch.

                                FITCH
                          (following Bud)
                      This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy
                      bullshit is not how it's done!

                                BUD
                      While your agents build their cases and
                      set for court, he'll erase the debt owed
                      to all of you. Overnight.

                                FITCH
                      So you're implying I should thank him?

            Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...

                                FITCH
                      Look, Carter, whether we like it or not,
                      you and I have to work together on this.
                      We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full
                      protection, if he agrees to testify. 

                                BUD
                      That'll never happen.

                                FITCH
                      Why the hell not?!

                                BUD
                          (turns)
                      'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He
                      has nothing. Why do you think he lit that
                      fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he
                      doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want
                      it. He would've just left 'em for dead.

                                FITCH
                      For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not
                      taking the fall for this! The plan is--

                                BUD
                      No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got
                      balls big enough to relate to this guy.
                      If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be
                      in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in
                      this situation. And you wouldn't be
                      askin' stupid fuckin' questions!
                          (walking away)
                      I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your
                      agents off my ass.

            Bud storms off.

                                                                  BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            EXT. WHISKEY BAY (BLEACH BYPASS) - DAWN - IMAGINATION

            Lynn stumbles through the woods, holding her baby. Scared.
            Lost. Their skin bleached-out. Eyes hollow. Like apparitions.

            We're in a dream. A sadistic enhancement.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            JESSE'S EYES

            His family's image dissolves inside them.

            WIDEN to reveal Jesse before a cracked mirror in a SERVICE
            STATION BATHROOM. Perspiring, he re-bandages his hand as
            blood swirls down the drain. 

            INT. CORRIDOR, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

            An expensively dressed Kiersey emerges from a courtroom,
            flanked by a pair of well dressed AIDES.

                                KIERSEY
                      Get back to the office. Follow up on the
                      Arthur Bierce case. I need names and
                      numbers on my desk by three pm.

            The Aides scurry down another corridor, as Kiersey exits the
            building through the glass front doors...

            INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

            Kiersey moves to a parked Cadillac pops the trunk and sets
            his briefcase inside, when...

            A RUSHING POV FROM BEHIND: Slams the trunk on Kiersey's hands.

            Kiersey SCREAMS, drops to his knees. His wrists wedged in the
            trunk. And standing over him...is Bud.

                                KIERSEY
                      OH, CHRIST! JESUS CHRIST! MY HANDS!

                                BUD
                      You know who I am?

                                KIERSEY
                      OPEN THE TRUNK! PLEASE! OPEN THE TRUNK!

            Bud kicks him in the stomach, doubles him over.

                                BUD
                      You know who the fuck I am?!

                                KIERSEY
                      YES!

                                BUD
                      Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed?

            No answer. Bud pounds on the trunk. Kiersey CRIES OUT.

                                BUD
                      I'll break every fuckin' bone you got.
                      Start talkin'.

                                KIERSEY
                          (hyperventilating)
                      I can't-- I can't--

            Bud slams both fists on the trunk. All his weight.

                                BUD
                          (off Kiersey's SCREAM)
                      Can't what?! What can't you do?!

            Bud, enraged, kicks Kiersey's ribs in. Again.

                                BUD
                      You piece of shit, talk!

                                KIERSEY
                          (hysterical)
                      He made Jesse...The investigation...
                      Everything...

                                BUD
                      His family?

                                KIERSEY
                      Everything! After that, he was just a
                      loose end!

            Bud opens the trunk. Kiersey crumbles to the ground, shaking.

                                BUD
                      Where's Lucian Adams?

                                KIERSEY
                      I don't know!

            Bud jams a foot in Kiersey's neck. Grabs his hands and bends.
            We HEAR bones snap.

                                BUD
                      Lucian's goin' down. You either go down
                      together, or you give him to me.

                                KIERSEY
                          (a mile a minute)
                      I never talk to him directly! I swear,
                      they page me-- 

            Bud roughly searches Kiersey.

                                KIERSEY
                      --Every night at five, for a six o'clock
                      call! They page from different numbers!

            Bud finds a PAGER on Kiersey's slacks, yanks it off. Then
            leans down with a smile, venomous:

                                BUD
                      You're a dead man, Kiersey.

            Bud storms off. Kiersey on the ground, a trembling mess.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            Catfish does a rail of meth off the counter.

            He lights a cigarette and sits down in a re-upholstered lazy
            boy where a TATTOO ARTIST is setting up... 

            Catfish proffers his forearm, displaying a row of notches
            (kills). And Tattoo Artist begins to outline two more...

                                TATTOO ARTIST
                      'Bout out of room, Catfish. You best
                      start collectin' scalps.

            Catfish smugs. Drags on his cigarette...

            WHEN A SUDDEN GUNSHOT SPRAYS CATFISH WITH BLOOD. Tattoo
            Artist drops dead on the floor.

                                CATFISH
                          (looks up)
                      What the fuck?!

            Jesse, standing over Catfish. A .45 comes down twice fast
            with a CRACK! Catfish is knocked cold.

            INT. BUD'S CAR - DAY

            Bud, on police radio, driving high-speed.

                                BUD
                      What do you got? 

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. METRO OFFICE - SAME

            Bud's VOICE over speaker phone. Marandino on the line with a
            sheaf of paperwork. Cobb enters.

                                MARANDINO
                      He's in the French Quarter. All numbers
                      paging Kiersey between five and six p.m.,
                      the last seventy-two hours, are pay
                      phones within a three mile radius.

                                BUD
                      Alright.

                                COBB
                      Bud, you gotta talk to Braddock. He's
                      lookin' for you, he's fuckin' pissed. 

                                BUD
                      Hold him off. I'll square it with him
                      when I get to the Quarter. 

            Bud punches the gas, traveling 90 mph.

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            CATFISH'S EYES blink awake - pinpoint dilated. WIDEN TO
            REVEAL he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy-boy.

            And Jesse is seated beside him.

                                JESSE
                      I'm gonna ask questions... 

            Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:
            Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

                                JESSE
                      When I'm satisfied with your answers, I'm
                      gonna kill you. How long it takes and how
                      much blood you want to spill...that's up
                      to you.

            Catfish grins. A wide, Amphetamine smile.

                                CATFISH
                      What do you want to know? Want to hear
                      about your brother? How we had him shot
                      up with strychnine? How he died slow
                      death?

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,
            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS
            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD
            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

                                CATFISH
                      OH, YOU SONOFABITCH!!!

                                JESSE
                      Four days ago, my wife and son were
                      killed.
                          (pause)
                      I hear you took the contract?

            Catfish smiles. Lips quivering with hate.

                                CATFISH
                      Forty-four pounds, Miznay-Schardin. Like
                      you taught me. Fuck yeah, I took it. Blew
                      your bitch and kid sky high.

            Jesse grabs the pliers, YANKS another tooth. Catfish HOWLS.

                                CATFISH
                      MOTHERFUCKER!!!

            BLOOD SPEWS as the drill digs in. Catfish SCREAMS. Jesse
            tosses teeth on the tray.

                                CATFISH
                          (thrashing wildly)
                      OH, YOU'RE GONNA DIE! YOU'RE GONNA
                      FUCKIN' DIE!

            Jesse grabs Catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's
            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

                                JESSE
                      Where's he hidin' out?

            Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin: 

                                CATFISH
                      Get fucked.

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth
            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip
            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

            Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

                                CATFISH
                          (barely audible)
                      New Orleans...

                                JESSE
                      New Orleans. Where in New Orleans?

                                CATFISH
                      New Orleans...

            Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes. And death is there...
            Begging.

                                JESSE
                          (softly)
                      I believe you.

            With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly.

            Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse
            and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            JESSE'S CAR racing up I-10, along the roaring Mississippi,
            toward a blood red horizon of a Louisiana sundown.

            EXT. FRENCH QUARTER, NEW ORLEANS - ESTABLISH - DUSK

            Cars line crowded streets in the heart of New Orleans. 

            I/E. BUD'S CAR - LOWER FRENCH QUARTER - DUSK

            TIGHT ON A DASHBOARD CLOCK: 5:04 p.m.

            Bud, waiting, parked outside a POLICE PRECINCT in the Lower
            French Quarter. Kiersey's pager on the dash. Waiting. Then:

            THE PAGER BUZZES.

            Bud grabs it, hurries out to a nearby pay-phone. Dials... 

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      It's Bud. I got a number.

                      Governor Nicholls Wharf. Between St. Ann
                      and Toulouse. You're a half mile south.

                                BUD
                      Get your ass down here.

            Bud slams down the phone. Jumps in his car. Hits the gas.

            EXT. GOVERNOR NICHOLLS WHARF - DUSK

            A busy promenade near the down river end of the Mississippi.

            Bud waits low in his car, parked in a distant lot. Through
            the windshield, WE SEE the subject of his surveillance...

            A PAY-PHONE

            on a crowded sidewalk. Faces pass. A Man in a JACKET arrives
            at the phone. He waits. Checks his watch...

            ...Bud checks his clock: 6:10

            The "Jacket" picks up the phone and dials...

            KIERSEY'S PAGER GOES OFF. 

                                BUD
                      Here we go.

            Jacket waits. No call. Walks away. Bud FOLLOWS on foot...

            EXT. FRENCH MARKET - DUSK

            A sprawling swirl of humanity, live jazz and bars. The Jacket
            passes through. Twenty feet back, Bud keeps pace...  

            ANOTHER PHONE BOOTH

            Jacket enters. Pumps coins into the PAY-PHONE. Dials... 

                                RECEPTIONIST V.O.

                      J. Kiersey--

            Jacket hangs up. More coins. Another number...

                                KIERSEY'S VOICE V.O.
                          (recording)
                      Hello, you've reached the Kiersey
                      residence. No one's home right now--

            Jacket hangs up. Exits east onto BARRACKS STREET. Glances
            over his shoulder, then ahead, as Bud rounds the corner...

            EXT. DECATUR AVENUE

            Jacket crosses into a LIQUOR STORE. 

            Bud stalls at the corner, casing the street. Takes everything
            in. He reaches for his cigarettes, finds a crumpled back.
            Then crosses the street to...

            A NEWSSTAND

            outside the liquor store. Bud buys cigarettes and a newspaper.

            He opens the paper, glances at the headlines. At the same
            time, peers into the LIQUOR STORE WINDOW... 

            ...The Jacket walks toward the back of the store and out a
            door to an ALLEY.

            Bud heads south on Decatur. Lights a cigarette, as he passes
            various stores on the block. A private two-story building
            with blacked out windows at the far end: "TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN".

            Bud turns into... 

            EXT. A COBBLESTONE ALLEY

            Lined with boutiques on one side. Back of Tibedaux's on the
            other. A cargo gate is up and MEN are hoisting crates into a
            truck...  

            The Jacket is there, talking to them:

                                JACKET
                      Should've been on the road twenty minutes
                      ago. Hurry it up. 

            Bud pauses at a DRESS SHOP. Stares into the storefront glass,
            reflecting the Jacket and Men...   

            Jacket walks off. Bud flicks his cigarette, enters...

            INT. THE DRESS SHOP

            ...and peers out the window, watching the Jacket leave the
            alley and enter a FRENCH COLONIAL.

            INT. FRENCH COLONIAL, LOBBY - DUSK

            A SECURITY GUARD behind a desk. As Jacket walks in... 

                                SECURITY GUARD
                      What's goin' on, Jack?

            Jacket moves through a warren of CORRIDORS. Hardened MEN
            shuttle in and out of private offices. Plates on the doors:
            "Material Management." "Plating & Metal". "Demolition"...  

            Jacket knocks on a door. Opens it to...

            INT. PRIVATE OFFICE

            A bulked-out man at his desk... MILLS. Looks up as Jacket
            enters:

                                MILLS
                      Talk to me.

                                JACKET
                      Got nothin' to tell. Kiersey didn't call.  

                                MILLS
                      Try his office?

                                JACKET
                      'Ain't there. His home neither.

            Mills picks up the desk-phone. Dials...

                                MILLS
                          (into phone)
                      It's Mills. I need sweepers through Baton
                      Rouge. Find Daniel Kiersey.
                          (then to Jacket)
                      Keep pagin' him.

            EXT. DECATUR AVE + ESPLANADE - DUSK

            Jacket exits the Colonial and enters a corner CAFE. INSIDE,
            WE SEE Jacket move to a pay-phone and dial...

            ON KIERSEY'S PAGER, as it BUZZES again.

            REVEAL: BUD

            now seated at the window of this second-story room, using
            BINOCULARS to case the surrounding perimeter. 

                                BUD
                      C'mon. Show me somethin'.

            POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: as the night comes alive. Trucks pull
            to and from the alley. Patrons valet and enter Tibedaux's. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Braddock, walking down the hall with two POLICEMEN, unlocks a
            heavy door and enters...

            A HOLDING ROOM

            ...where Kiersey waits. Pale skin, beaded in sweat. Both
            hands in casts.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Mr. Kiersey. I'm Captain Mike Braddock.
                      How can I help you?

                      Detective Bud Carter is out of control!

                          (corrects him)
                      Detective "Lieutenant." Now how can I
                      help you?

            Kiersey, a shaky breath.

                                KIERSEY
                      How long till you make an arrest in your
                      investigation of Lucian Adams?

            Braddock, just stares.

                                KIERSEY
                      I'm willing to provide you with documents
                      and information to secure his conviction.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Why?

                                KIERSEY
                      Why do you think? I'm afraid for my life.
                          (and the hammer)
                      I'll confirm whatever Jesse Wheeler's
                      given you.

            REVEAL NOW: COBB, in a nondescript VAN. Parked a quarter
            block off Esplanade. He triggers photos through tinted glass.

            STILL PHOTOS CLICK -- the Town Car doors open. Two AB

                      He wants to make a deal, Bud. I can keep

                      They're inside.

            Bud sits back. Then: 

            KIERSEY'S PAGER BUZZES AGAIN. (The cafe number)

                                BUD
                          (grabs phone, to Braddock)
                      Mike, I need Kiersey to place a call.
                      Five minutes, or this opportunity's gone.

                      Give me the number...

            INT. CAFE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

            Bingham, Kay and Mills at a booth, sipping coffee. Two
            Soldiers guard the front and back doors. 

            Mills looks at Jacket, who waits by the pay-phone. Both
            noticeably on edge. Finally --

            The PAY-PHONE RINGS.

                                MILLS
                          (to Kay + Bingham)
                      Excuse me.

            He gets up, walks toward the phone. When Jacket answers,
            Mills takes the receiver from him. 

                                MILLS
                          (into phone)

            INT. HALLWAY PHONE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT

            A nervous Kiersey on the line. Braddock, Policemen nearby.

                      Where the fuck you been?

                                KIERSEY
                      I apologize. I've been tooth and nail
                      with the D.A., in court, all day.

                                MILLS V.O.
                      Everything good?

                                KIERSEY
                      Everything's fine. Just lay low. Regular
                      time tomorrow.   

            Mills hangs up.

            Kiersey turns. Pale. To Braddock: 

                                KIERSEY
                      Now get me protection.

            INT. CAFE - NIGHT

            Mills returns to the booth. Kay and Bingham look at him.

                                BINGHAM
                      So?

                                MILLS
                      All good. Let's eat.

            EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

            Marandino watches as Bingham, Kay and Mills pull their coats
            on and exit the cafe...

                      Entering Tibedaux's Tavern...

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN - NIGHT

            A busy nightclub crowded wall-to-wall with PATRONS.

            FOLLOW Kay, Bingham and Mills, passing tables, greeting
            "connected" types... and through a far door into a back room. 

            EXT. CHARTRES + ESPLANADE - NIGHT

            FOLLOW Marandino as he walks down the street, knocks on the
            back of the Van. 

            INT. COBB'S VAN - NIGHT

            Cobb, now dressed in evening attire, throws open the door and
            Marandino climbs in. They exchange transmitter for headset
            and Cobb leaves the van for the street...

            EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - NIGHT

            Cobb approaches the front door, where a pair of large DOORMEN
            stand.

                                DOORMAN #1
                      Can we help you?

                      Just lookin' for a drink and a bite to

                                DOORMAN #1
                      Think you'll find what you're lookin' for
                      across the street.  
                          (gestures)
                      Try the cafe.

            Cobb stares at both Doormen #1 and #2, immovable forces. 

                                COBB
                      Alright. Thanks.

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

            BUD'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: Cobb leaves Tibedaux's and
            positions himself at an outdoor table in the cafe.

            POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Back of Tibedaux's. A BALCONY
            GUARD emerges with a rifle, posts.

                      I've got a man on the south balcony.
                      Armed.

            The door below opens and a second GUARD steps out, posts.

                                MARANDINO
                          (into radio)
                      Second man at the door now. Street level.
                      Possibly armed.

            SUDDENLY HEADLIGHTS FLOOD MARANDINO'S REAR WINDSHIELD.
            Marandino ducks, a reflex action.

            EXT. DECATUR

            Lights from a CADILLAC and a GRAND MARQUIS appear and come
            down the street - past Cobb - SLOWLY. Blacked out windows...

            INT. COBB'S CAR

                          (into radio)
                      A Cadillac and a Grand Marquis, just
                      pulled in the alley.

            ...and stop behind Tibedaux's. 

            Passenger doors of both cars open, two AB SOLDIERS emerge.
            They open the rear door of the Cadillac and shadow the man
            they're escorting: LUCIAN.

            Balcony Guard looks on as Door Guard allows Lucian and his
            Soldiers to enter the building.

                                MARANDINO
                          (tense, into radio)

                      the cars. Initial perps still on post.
                      Lucian's entering the building...

            Bud pulls on a KEVLAR VEST, holsters a .45. Extra clips on
            the waistband. Checks a loaded PUMP SG.

            Ready.

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Marandino, fastens on a vest, loads a 12-Gauge, locks.

            Suddenly, through the side window... A LONE FIGURE, IN A
            QUARTER TRENCH, MOVES PAST. It happens in a flash.

            Marandino LOOKS, SEES only a quick profile as the Figure cuts
            between parked cars and walks across the street... 

                                MARANDINO
                          (into radio)
                      I need eyes on a single, white male
                      crossing Esplanade. Possible intent...

            EXT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

            Cobb looks over his shoulder, SEES the Figure 75 yards away,
            moving briskly across Esplanade...

            We still can't see his face.

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT 

            Bud grabs the rifle, eye on the scope, aims out the window. 

            POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: as the CROSS-HAIRS find the Figure
            walking. SEE the BODY. Then the FACE... IT'S JESSE. 

            ON BUD, spinning now.

                          (beat, into radio)
                      It's Jesse...

                          (quickly, radio filter)
                      He's heading toward the alley, Bud. We
                      take him down?

            BUD'S POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: THE CROSS-HAIRS FIXED ON JESSE'S
            HEAD - TRACKING - RACK FOCUS... This decision... He HAS to
            decide... And he does:

                                BUD
                      Let him go.

                                COBB V.O.

                      Bud, that's crazy! Jesse goes in first,
                      he's gonna blow this whole thing. We
                      can't let that happen.

                          (intense, into radio)
                      That's exactly what we're gonna do! We
                      got no way inside. Let Jesse go in hard
                      and draw fire. He pushes Lucian out to
                      us. Stand the fuck down. I'm on my way.

            Bud throws down the rifle, grabs the pump SG, runs out the
            door...

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Marandino, sweeps the alley with his binoculars. No Jesse.

            A LONG HALLWAY

            as he pulls a REMINGTON SAWED-OFF, slung on a strap, to his
            left hand, .45 to his right.

            Mid-hall, AB #6 looks over, freezes.  

            JESSE'S SHOTGUN ROARS, REVERBERATING DOWN THE HALL, AND TWO

            INT. BACK ROOM

            Lucian with Kay and Bingham. They HEAR the explosion.

            INT. HALLWAY

            Jesse steps over the dead AB #6 without breaking stride.
            Comes to a door. Kicks it in... 

            INT. PAYROLL OFFICE

            ...And Mills FIRES a gun, burning Jesse's ear -- Blood pours
            down his neck -- and Jesse's Tactical FIRES.

            Mills is HIT IN THE THROAT. He falls into a chair. And his
            eyes - at the fierce face of death - are filled with Jesse,
            who FIRES TWO ROUNDS. One to the head. That fast.   

            INT. BACK ROOM

            Two AB SOLDIERS #7 and #8 hurry in. Lucian, Kay and Bingham
            stand up. 

                                AB #7
                      Let's go. We're gettin' you out of here.

            All three bosses draw GUNS. Lock and load. 

            INT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

            Outside, the sound of gunfire is heard. Jacket turns to the
            BARKEEP. Alarmed:

                                JACKET
                      Give me that fuckin' shotgun!

            Barkeep lays a shotgun on the bar. Jacket reaches. When...

                          (boaring in, 9MM aimed)
                      POLICE! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE GUN! STEP
                      FUCKIN' BACK!!

            Jacket looks at Cobb. Steps back. Hands in the air.

            EXT. MOTEL + STREET - SAME

            Bud bursts outside, full throttle. Shouts into the radio:

                                BUD
                      Jam the alley! No one goes in or out!

            EXT. STREET + ALLEYS AROUND TIBEDAUX'S - SAME

            Marandino hits the gas. TIRES SCREECH as he slides sideways
            and secures the mouth of the alley. Door kicks out. 12-gauge
            levels.

            EXT. FRONT OF TIBEDAUX'S + DECATUR AVE

            Doorman #1, HEARING the commotion turns...

            ...SEES INSIDE THE CAFE, Cobb cuffing Jacket and Barkeep.

            Doorman #1 draws a Para-Ordnance .45, FIRES. A VOLLEY OF
            SHOTS SLAM INTO THE CAFE.  

            Cobb can't make it through INCOMING FIRE and covers.
            Remaining PATRONS SCREAM, drop under tables.  

            Doorman #1 KEEPS FIRING, advancing towards the Cafe, when--
            BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST takes his head off -- REVEALING BUD --
            behind him, running toward Tibedaux's.  

            I/E. TIBEDAUX'S, DOWNSTAIRS

            PATRONS stampede for the door. Lucian, Bingham and Kay with
            AB #7 and #8 follow...

            OUTSIDE TO THE STREET

            ...and Bud is coming right for them.

            CLOSE ON LUCIAN. The shock of seeing Bud. 

            Lucian FIRES.

            Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them.

            Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S, MAINTENANCE ROOM

            Jesse yanks off the cover of the main electric panel. He rips
            out incoming lines and FIRES into the lighting circuit. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            VARIOUS ROOMS INSIDE TIBEDAUX'S

            Fluorescent units explode, plunging us into DARKNESS. Arcs
            SPUTTER and FLARE, the corridors now strobe-lit. 

            EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - SAME

            Cobb runs out of the cafe, pushing through civilians. 

                                COBB
                      Down! Get down!

            Bud pursues Lucian...

                                BUD
                      Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S

            Bud enters-

            Split-second and DOORMAN #2 OPENS FIRE from the waiter's
            entrance.

            Bud drops and FIRES BACK. Doorman #2 goes down. Bud runs
            across overturned tables and up a STAIRWELL...

            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, TIBEDAUX'S

            Jesse emerges. AB #9 steps out, FIRES. The bullet hits
            Jesse's vest, knocking him backwards.

            Jesse levels the sawed-off. FIRES. AB #9 falls in a heap.
            Jesse rises, keeps moving...

            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS, ROOMS - TIBEDAUX'S

            MOVING WITH BUD entering, KICKING down doors, sweeping rooms
            with his shotgun... No sign of Lucian.

            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS

            Jesse is coming... 

            ...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS. 

            He throws open a door to a BAR AREA.  

            AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse
            UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles.

            A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops
            to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE
            REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar.

            HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic
            wildly. Bottles and glasses explode.

            Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER.

            BEHIND THE BAR

            bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the
            .45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE. 

            INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS

            Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud...
            who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee
            into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun.    

            A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN

            AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW
            HOLES in the wall.

            A SECOND DOOR OPENS

            ...and AB #14 steps out, draws. Bud throws him in the way of
            CROSS-FIRE. AB #13 takes AB #14's SHOTS. 

            Bud aims past. FIRES ONCE.

            AB #14 is hit dead center and drops like an oak.

            Both men dead. That fast, and Bud is on the move... 

            EXT. ALLEY, TIBEDAUX'S - CONTINUOUS

            AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the
            alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front--

            COBB FIRES. AB #10 is BLOWN APART, as AB #11 FIRES back,
            hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down
            stunned.

                                COBB 
                          (into radio)
                      I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.

            AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive.
            TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead.

            Police shouting. Civilians running, as...

            INT. BACK BAR AREA, DOWNSTAIRS

            GUNFIGHT ENSUES. 

            Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles
            down the stairwell like a rag doll. 

            Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and
            rolls to his back... 

            Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45
            and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest.

            Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor.
            Both men, bleeding profusely, thrash along the floor...

            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

            Bud, racing toward a stairwell, LEAPS down a flight, turns,
            and RUNS down another. 

            INT. BACK BAR AREA

            Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife
            from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS.
            Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS...

            ...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and
            impales Bingham through the throat. Dead.

            Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet...

            BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT

            out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING
            NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...

            ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.

            Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

            IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS
            INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. 

            Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the
            trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,
            BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS
            FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.

            Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to
            break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over
            against Lucian's face.

            Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

            Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.
            Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. 

            Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

            Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes
            down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and
            Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

            Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.
            IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on
            Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

            Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian
            by the throat and presses down.

            Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,
            tearing skin. 

            Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

            Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at
            Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

            Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the
            last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

            Bud lets go.

            Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of
            blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

            Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on
            the floor...And he slows...

            Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.
            Only the dark pool of blood around him.

            Lucian passes out.

                                BUD
                          (into radio)
                      I got him... I got Lucian.

            SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE...

            ...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up
            the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the
            street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and
            emergency vehicles... 

            ...to where life goes on in New Orleans.

                                                           DIP TO BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAYS LATER

            The sun is out. The sky above is clear.

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up. 

            Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as
            they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES...

            KIERSEY

            ...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes.
            Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them.

            Bud walks Lucian past, into...

            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2

            ...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence
            hangs, several moments. 

            ON BUD                                                             

            starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow
            smile spreads...

                                BUD
                      Want a cup of coffee?

                                                         THE END
