FADE IN:

EXT. A HYPERBLUE LOS ANGELES SKY -- DAY

The sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an LAPD
helicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone.

LAPD radio transmissions crackle like static electricity
around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the
puckered asshole of Eagle Rock.

A man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house --

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           I'm gonna kill this dog!  You make my
           wife talk to me or I'm gonna shoot this
           fuckin' dog!

A five-member SWAT tactical team appears out of nowhere--full
black assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into
position on either side of the front door.  Only now do we
get the full picture:  Helicopters overhead, radio cars
surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the
trigger --

When the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a
thumbs-up to --

SERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT. MURRAY LEIFITZ

Talley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the LAPD Command and
Control van.  Leifitz is the Crisis Response Team SWAT 
commander; Talley, the primary negotiator.  It's so hot out
here that Talley has stripped down to a tee-shirt and vest.

                     LEIFITZ
           They're good to go, Talley.  Your word,
           and we're in the house.

                     TALLEY
           No one's going anywhere, L-T.  We can
           talk this guy down.

Talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined
into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into the phone)
           Hey, George?  George, don't kill the dog,
           okay?  We don't want to hear a gun go off
           in there.

A phone crashes through the window and lands in the front
yard --

                     MALIK'S VOICE
               (screaming from the house)
           Fuck you!

                     LEIFITZ
           I don't think he wants to talk.

Frustrated, Talley slumps back against the van as the SWAT
Intelligence Officer, Lloyd Keith, scuttles up to them --

                     TALLEY
           Where's the guy's wife?

                     KEITH
           She didn't take the kid to her sister's.
           The neighbors were wrong.

                     TALLEY
           Goddamnit, you said we had her.  I told
           him we had her!

                     KEITH
           We got bad information, Talley.  I can't
           pull her out of my ass!

Up at the house, George Edward Malik steps into the window.
Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned
the corner on insanity --

                     MALIK
               (shouting at Talley)
           You said my wife was gonna talk to me,
           you lying fuck!  I'm gonna kill her dog,
           then shoot myself!  I mean it!

Talley stares at Malik, thinking, then abruptly grabs Keith
by the collar --

                     TALLEY
               (to Keith)
           Pull the dog's name out of your ass.  Get
           the dog's name.

Talley steps out from behind the command van so that Malik
can see him.

                     LEIFITZ
               (alarmed by Talley's move)
           Talley!  You're in the line of fire!

Talley ignores Leifitz; he is totally focused on Malik and on
defusing the situation --

                     TALLEY
           I didn't lie to you, George.  You scared
           your wife pretty good last night.  We're
           having a hard time finding her.

                     MALIK
           She better talk to me!  I'm gonna kill
           her goddamned dog!

                     TALLEY
           You and I have been talking for, what, 
           sixteen hours?  Keep talking.  Is that
           your dog, too?

Malik steps away from the window --

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           I don't know whose dog it is.  She lied
           about everything else, so she probably
           lied about the dog.

                     TALLEY
           I know you're hurting.  You lose your
           job, you find out your wife's fucking
           another guy . . . but don't give up.
           We'll have her talk to you.

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           Then why won't she open her mouth?!  Why
           doesn't the bitch say something??? 

Something about Malik's statement bothers Talley.  The
wording is odd, suspicious --

                     TALLEY
           George?  Come back to the window.

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           STOP LOOKING AT ME!!!

Talley grows even more concerned.  Was Malik talking to him?

                     TALLEY
           George?  Leave the dog alone and come to
           the window.

Talley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (to Leifitz)
           What's the dog's name?

                     LEIFITZ
           The neighbors say he doesn't have a dog.

The pieces fall into place for Talley:  The wife that no one
can find, the dog that doesn't exist....

                     MALIK'S VOICE
           OPEN YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH OR I'M GONNA
           SHOOT THIS DOG!

In a single terrible moment, Talley realizes that Malik is
not talking to him; he's talking to his wife --

                     TALLEY
           Murray!!  They're in the house!  His
           wife's in the house!

Even as Talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house,
freezing the moment.  A second shot follows the first as the
tactical team breaches the front door --

Talley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in
nightmare slow motion --

INT. MALIK'S HOUSE -- DAY

Talley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team
through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight.  SWAT cops
are cuffing Malik even though he's already dead of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound; Malik's wife is sprawled on the
couch where she has been dead for fourteen hours; two tac
officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that
sprays from the neck of Malik's nine-year-old son even as one
of them screams for the paramedics --

Talley is numb; it's all too much, too heavy, too horrible.
He kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boy's
hand.  He stares into the boy's eyes, and the boy stares
back.  The child's face grows pale as he drains of blood.  We
hear his heart beating.  We hear it slow.  We hear it stop.

Talley stares at the dead boy.  The dead boy's lifeless eyes
stare at nothing.

TITLES

Another hyperblue sky, but now we're in an upscale bedroom
community in the sun-scorched high desert north of LA --

A legend appears:  One Year Later.

EXT. KIM'S MINIMARKET AND GAS STATION -- DAY

A rotted-out Toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the
minimart, white-boy hip-hop booming on the radio which dies
with the engine --

Dennis Rooney is driving; twenty-three years old, working-
class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding
good looks.  In the middle: Kevin Rooney, nineteen, scared
shitless at what they're about to do.  Riding shotgun:  Mars
Krupchek, twenty-four, a large pasty guy with a shaved head
and faraway eyes.

                     KEVIN
           C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought
           we were gonna go to the movies.

                     DENNIS
               (grins past Kevin to Mars)
           Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here
           on the edge, no one around, it's perfect,
           right?

                     MARS
           I'll check it out.

Mars slides out of the truck.  He has a tattoo on the back of
his tattoo that says:  BURN IT.

As soon as Mars is gone, Dennis frowns at Kevin --

                     DENNIS
           Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think
           you're a dick.

                     KEVIN
           Robbing this place is gonna put you back
           in prison.

                     DENNIS
           Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.

                     KEVIN
           We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why
           even take the chance?

                     DENNIS
           Because if you don't take the chance,
           you're already dead.

Dennis pulls a pistol from his pants to check the magazine.

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Thirty seconds, we'll be down the road.
           Thirty seconds.  Then we'll go to the
           movies.

Mars returns and nods his approval --

                     MARS
           It's perfect.

That's all it takes.

INT. KIM'S MINIMART -- DAY

Junior Kim, Jr., is short, squat, and forty-two years old.
He's reading a magazine behind the counter when Dennis and
Mars enter; Dennis trying to disarm him with a smile --

As Dennis reaches the counter, he lifts his tee-shirt to
reveal the butt of his pistol --

                     DENNIS
           A pack of Marlboros for my friend and all
           your cash, you gook motherfucker!

But Junior Kim is ready.  He lurches to his feet, bringing up
a pistol of his own --

                     MARS
           He's got a gun!

Dennis lunges across the counter, grabbing Kim's gun, and the 
two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death-struggle for
possession of the weapon --

                     DENNIS
           Mars, help me --

Dennis and Kim bounce from the counter to the Slurpy machine,
the Glock locked between them, pointing first one way, then
the other, their eyes meeting as -- BAM -- the gun goes off.

Junior Kim's eyes widen.  Dennis and Junior both look down at
the red blossom that grows on Junior Kim's chest --

                     KEVIN
               (screaming in the background)
           Dennis!  Dennis, someone's coming!

Kim falls into the Slurpy machine, then slides to the floor.
Dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door. 

But Mars hesitates.  Instead of running, he picks up Kim's
gun, then leans over the counter to look at Kim's body.  We
cannot see his face --

EXT. THE MINIMART -- DAY

A forty-something soccer mom named Margaret Hammond is about
to enter the minimart when Dennis and Kevin burst out,
knocking her on her ass.  Mars follows a moment later --

Margaret watches their red pickup lurch away, then rushes
into the store --

INT. THE TRUCK -- DAY

Dennis power-shifts into gear, clashing tortured metal as he
pushes the Toyota as hard as it will go.  No one is talking;
they're screaming --

                     KEVIN
           There's fuckin' blood all over you!

                     DENNIS
           I didn't know he would have a gun!  It
           just went off!

Dennis sees himself in the rearview mirror.  His face is 
splattered with red dew, the sight of it freaking him out --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Jesus!  Fuckin' Jesus, it's on my face!

The trunk careens crazily off the road.  Mars calmly runs a
hand over Dennis's face --

                     MARS
           Relax.  It's only blood.

Dennis upshifts hard again, the truck lurching as the tranny
howls --

                     DENNIS
           FUCK you, Mars!  I got it all over me!

-- whereupon the tortured transmission gives with a loud BANG
and the truck loses power --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           MotherFUCKING piece of SHIT!!!

EXT. FLANDERS ROAD -- DAY

Flanders Road is lined with trees, hedges, and the exclusive
housing developments that dot the countryside around Bristo
Camino.

The Toyota jerks to a stop well off the road, and Dennis,
Mars, and Kevin pile out, stuffing pistols and bullets into
their pockets --

                     KEVIN
           That woman's gonna call the cops.

                     DENNIS
           Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!

                     KEVIN
           What if he's dead?  What if you killed
           him?

Dennis grabs him by the throat; Mars steps between them --

                     MARS
           People are looking.

Dennis sees that Mars is right; people in passing cars are
looking.  He releases his brother --

                     DENNIS
           That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not
           gonna go in for murder.

                     KEVIN
           We're on foot.  We can't get away.

                     DENNIS
           We're surrounded by houses, dumbass.
           Every house has a car in the garage.
           All we have to do is take one.

Dennis and Mars take off for the wall, Kevin reluctantly
following --

EXT. WALTER SMITH'S HOME -- THE CUL-DE-SAC -- DAY

The camera reveals a two-story California Mediterranean home
in the exclusive housing development known as York Estates.
You can't get in the door for less than one-point-five, and
this house costs more:  Eight thousand square feet of used
brick and custom tile set on a lushly landscaped acre --

                     WALTER SMITH'S VOICE
           You can pick them up whenever you want.

INT. WALTER SMITH'S OFFICE -- DAY

Walter Smith is at his computer behind his desk.  He's forty
and fit, casually dressed with thinning hair and glasses,
currently leaning back as he talks on his phone --

                     WALTER
               (into the phone)
           I have his corporate and personal on two
           disks, labeled Marlon and Al.

As Smith talks, he ejects a Zip disk from his computer,
attaches a label reading Al, then places it in a palm-sized
case beside the first disk, Marlon --

                     WALTER (CONT'D)
           What, you don't have a sense of humor?
           He's going to love it.

Walter's ten-year-old son, Thomas, suddenly charges around
the desk and pulls at his father's arm --

                     THOMAS
           My stomach is eating me!

                     WALTER
               (into the phone)
           Yeah, that's Thomas, the human piranha.
           I have to feed the animals while Pam's in
           Florida with her sister.

                     THOMAS
           My stomach has teeth!  It's eating my
           guts!

                     WALTER
               (still with the phone)
           Listen, is Glen on his way?  Great.  The
           paper's bagged and ready to go.  Bye.
               (hangs up; then)
           All right, all right, all right--it's 
           feeding time!

Walter allows his son to pull him around the desk to --

EXT. THE SMITHS' BACK YARD -- THE POOL -- DAY

A boom box blasts the latest teendiva megahit as Walter's
sixteen-year-old daughter, Jennifer, stretches out in cutoff
shorts and a bikini top, working on her tan.

Walter and Thomas appear in the French doors that open from
the back of the house --

                     WALTER
               (calling)
           Jen!  Come feed your brother!  He's
           wasting away!

                     JENNIFER
           Can't we send him to Florida?

                     WALTER
           Jen, c'mon, chop-chop!  I've got to
           finish my work!

Jennifer rolls her eyes, rises from the chaise longue, and
pads to the house.  As she clears the frame, the camera
swings toward the overgrown wall at the edge of the property.
Dennis silenty drops into the bushes --

EXT. BRISTO CAMINO PATROL CAR -- DAY

A sky blue Bristo Camino patrol car cruises along Flanders
Road --

INT. THE CRUISER -- OFFICER MIKE WELCH -- DRIVING

Welch is a young officer with an innocence to his eyes that
you don't find in urban cops.  He keeps a photo of his wife
and toddler son taped to the dash.

                     RADIO
           Four, base.  You there, Mike?

Welch picks up the radio microphone --

                     WELCH
           Four.  I'm gonna hit the Krispy-Kreme.
           You want a dozen?

                     RADIO
           Armed robbery, Kim's Minimart on Flanders
           Road, shots fired with a man down.

This is so unexpected that Welch waits for the punchline --

                     WELCH
           Are you kidding me?

                     RADIO
           Ah, suspects are three white males
           driving a red pickup last seen eastbound
           on Flanders.

Welch turns on his lights just as he sees the red Toyota
pickup abandoned on the side of the road and stands on his
brakes --

INT. THE SMITHS' KITCHEN -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

The Smiths' home sports an open floor plan with the kitchen
centrally located between a large family room, a hall that
leads to the front of the house, and the French doors that
open onto the pool area.

Jennifer is putting the finishing touches on three tuna
sandwiches as she calls to her brother --

                     JENNIFER
           Tell Daddy that lunch is ready.
               (no answer)
           Thomas, don't be a turd.  Tell --!

She turns to find herself face-to-face with Dennis, who
clamps a hand over her mouth --

                     DENNIS
               (quietly)
           I'm not going to hurt you.

Mars is holding Thomas.  Kevin is by the French doors --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Stop fighting.  Relax, and I'll let go.

Jennifer struggles until she sees that Mars is holding a
pistol to Thomas's head --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           That's better.  Be cool and we'll be
           outta here in five minutes.  Understand?

Jennifer nods, and Dennis removes his hand.  He has her
pinned to the counter, his body pressed into her's; she is
suddenly very aware that she is almost naked --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Who else is here?

                     JENNIFER
           My father.

Dennis grabs her hair and pulls her away --

INT. SMITHS' OFFICE -- DAY

It happens fast:  Dennis shoves Jennifer into the room, and
Mars and Kevin follow with Thomas --

Walter is feeding a computer print-out into a paper shredder
as they burst through the door --

                     DENNIS
           Get your ass in the chair!  Sit down!

Dennis shoves Jennifer to the floor and stalks directly
across the room, his gun trained on Walter.

Walter freezes, hands motionless, letting the paper feed into
the shredder.  Strangely, he has little outward reaction --

                     WALTER
               (quietly)
           Jen?  Are you all right?

                     DENNIS
           She'll be dead if you don't put your ass
           in that chair!

Walter carefully sits.  He is amazingly calm in the face of
this invasion.

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Kevin!  Don't stand there, asshole, close
           the windows!  Mars, keep him covered,
           dude!

Mars pushes Thomas down beside Jennifer, then aims his gun at
Walter.  Kevin closes the shutters as Dennis rips the 
electric cord from a lamp --

                     WALTER
           Who sent you?

                     DENNIS
           Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about
           this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you
           up, then we're gonna take your car.

Walter glances toward the shredder; the final page of paper
emerges as spaghetti and then the shredder stops --

                     WALTER
           The car.  All you want is the car?

                     DENNIS
           Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car!
           Gimme the goddamned keys!

A strange smile flickers at the corner of Walter's mouth as
if there's a joke within all this, then --

                     WALTER
           The keys are on the wall by the garage.
           Take it.  The tank's almost full.

                     KEVIN
           Dennis!  The cops!

Dennis rushes to the window --

EXT. THE SMITHS' HOUSE -- CUL DE SAC -- DAY

Mike Welch climbs out of the patrol car and keys his shoulder
mike as he appraises the house --

                     WELCH
               (into his radio mike)
           They had to go through the yard at 455
           Castle Way.  I'm going to approach.

Welch slowly moves up the walk toward the front door --

INT. THE ENTRY -- DAY

Dennis shoves Jennifer to the door --

                     DENNIS
           Open it!  You remember I'm right here!

EXT. THE HOUSE -- WITH WELCH

Welch is halfway up the walk when the door opens and
Jennifer, clearly terrified, peers out.  Welch hesitates --

                     WELCH
               (into his mike)
           Teenage female opened the front door.
               (to Jennifer)
           Miss, I found an abandoned vehicle on the
           other side of your wall.  Did three young
           men run through the area?

Jennifer doesn't answer.  Her eyes fill until two huge tears
roll down her cheeks.  Welch grows uneasy.  Something is
wrong, but he doesn't know what.  He stays where he is --

                     WELCH (CONT'D)
           Miss?

                     JENNIFER
           I didn't . . . see anyone.

Welch stares into Jennifer's eyes, pointedly shifting his
gaze to ask the silent question:  Are they here?

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- MARS AND KEVIN

are peering out the shutters when --

Mars suddenly shouts --

                     MARS
           He's going for his gun!

Mars opens fire, shooting through the window as --

DENNIS

kicks the door closed and fires through the door, Jennifer
screaming, as --

EXT. THE HOUSE -- DAY -- MIKE WELCH

tumbles backward, struggling weakly to pull his gun as blood
bubbles in his mouth.  He tries to rise, but can't --

                     WELCH
               (into his radio)
           Officer down.  Jesus, I've been shot.

                     RADIO VOICE
           Mike?  Mike, what did you say?!

Mike Welch blinks at the sky, but cannot answer -- 

INT. BRISTO CAMINO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

It's the kind of small-town police facility you might expect:
A general room with desks and computers, a coffee machine,
and a desk officer who thinks that crime is two teenagers
egging a house.

The camera establishes the low-key atmosphere, during which
it finds a glass door labeled J. Talley, chief of police --

INT. TALLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY

Jeff Talley is behind the desk, his voice muted because he is
locked in a painful phone conversation --

                     TALLEY
               (into phone)
           It's really hard, Jane.  This isn't the
           way I want it.

INT. JANE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

Jane Talley is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties.  She
has the efficient manner of a registered nurse, which she is,
and right now she's using all of her professional detachment
to keep herself together --

                     JANE
               (into phone)
           No?  Then whose idea was it for you take
           a job in the middle of nowhere?

Intercut Talley, who considers the photographs that decorate
his wall:  Shots of Talley in happier times with Jane and
their teenaged daughter, Amanda; Talley as a young SWAT
officer; the framed headline from the Bristo Weekly Standard
proclaiming:  EX-SWAT COP NEW BRISTO CHIEF!

                     TALLEY
           I need to work out some stuff.

                     JANE
           You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding
           from the job and you're hiding from me.

                     TALLEY
           I still see that boy's eyes.

Jane softens; she knows that a part of him is in terrible
pain.  But she's in pain, too --

                     JANE
           That happened a year ago.  You've been
           gone for almost six months.  How long do
           you have to punish yourself for something
           that wasn't your fault?

Talley studies the picture of his wife and daughter.  He
focuses on Amanda --

                     TALLEY
           Is Amanda there?

Jane cups the phone and calls to her daughter.  Amanda enters
and goes to the refrigerator.  She's fifteen and carrying the
weight of a seriously bad attitude --

                     JANE
               (to Amanda)
           It's Dad.  He wants to speak with you.

                     AMANDA
               (doesn't even glance over)
           I'm gonna see him later.

                     JANE
               (back to Talley)
           She has to go to the bathroom.

Jane turns away and lowers her voice, not wanting Amanda to hear --

                     JANE (CONT'D)
           You're not only punishing yourself, Jeff.
           Amanda and I are in this, too.

Talley knows, and he hurts like hell because of it --

                     TALLEY
           Can we talk some more when you get here?

                     JANE
           We'll see you in a couple of hours.

Jane hangs up without waiting for a response, then closes her
eyes, trying hard to keep herself together.

                     AMANDA
           I don't wanna go up there.  I want to 
           stay here with my friends.

                     JANE
           Pack your things.  You're going.

Jane stalks away without a glance back, and Amanda angrily
flips off her mother --

WITH TALLEY

He is clearly shaken by the call, but his thoughts are
interrupted when his assistant, an older woman named Louise
Vance, bursts in --

                     LOUISE
           Mike's been shot!  Someone shot Junior
           Kim, too --

Talley comes around his desk --

                     TALLEY
           What are you talking about, shot?  What
           happened?

                     LOUISE
           Three white males shot Junior.  Mike
           followed them to York Estates --

                     TALLEY
           Where are they?

                     LOUISE
           York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way.
           Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

Talley charges out --

EXT. YORK ESTATES -- CASTLE WAY -- DAY

Talley wheels into a wide, spacious cul-de-sac lined with
expensive estate homes, and pulls up behind another radio
car.  Anders and Jorgenson are crouched in the street --

Bullets snap into Talley's windshield, starring the glass --

                     TALLEY
           Sonofabitch.

Talley scrambles out of his car --

EXT. THE SMITHS' HOUSE -- TALLEY'S CAR -- DAY

Talley takes cover behind his front wheel.  Anders and
Jorgenson are young guys; they've never worked a high-crime
area; they've never made a felony arrest; and right now
they're scared shitless.

Mike Welch lies on the Smiths' front lawn, forty feet away --

                     ANDERS
           Welch is down!  They shot him!

                     JORGENSON
           We think it's the three guys who robbed
           Kim's.

                     TALLEY
           Are civilians inside?

                     JORGENSON
           He said something about a girl --

                     TALLEY
           Holster your guns!

Another shot cracks from the house as we hear the faint wail
of approaching sirens.  Talley edges around his car, trying
to see Welch --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (calling)
           Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?

                     ANDERS
           I think he's dead!

                     TALLEY
           Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.

Talley considers the situation and comes up with a plan --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           We have to cordon off the streets, then
           evacuate these houses.

                     JORGENSON
           What are we going to do about Mike?

                     TALLEY
           Keep your head down.

Talley scrambles back into his car.  He backs up, then powers
the car up the drive and onto the front lawn --

WITH WELCH

Talley roars to a stop between Welch and the house, using the
car as a shield.  More shots ping off his car as Talley
climbs out --

                     TALLEY
           How you doing, buddy?  You still alive?

Welch moans.  His shirt is soaked with blood where the
bullets caught him beneath his vest.  Talley can't waste
time.  The siren is closer now --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Jesus.  You hang on.

Talley hoists Welch into the backseat, then dives behind the
wheel.  He fishtails off the lawn and up the street --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC INTERSECTION -- DAY

The ambulance waits as Talley powers to a stop --

                     TALLEY
           He's in the backseat!

Paramedics pull Mike Welch from the car as Talley gets out.
He can see into the cul-de-sac from here, where Anders and
Jorgenson still hunker behind their car.  Talley keys his 
radio --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           This is Talley.  Who's on?

His radio crackles with overlapping voices --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           One at a time!  Clear the air!
               (as they settle)
           Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

Frantic voices once more overlap --

                     COP VOICES
           What about Mike?  Is Welch alive?  What
           happened?

                     TALLEY
               (forcefully)
           Quiet!  I want radio discipline.
               (as they quiet)
           Mike's hanging in.  Larry, Jorgy?  Listen
           up.

                     JORGENSON'S VOICE
           Go, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Find out who lives at four-five-five.  We
           gotta know who's in there.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered
           the door.

                     TALLEY
           Did he say if she was shooting at him?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
               (hesitant)
           He didn't say.

                     TALLEY
           Then we don't know if she's part of this
           or not.  Mickey, you up?

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.

                     TALLEY
           Mike found a red pickup abandoned on
           Flanders.  You see it?

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           It's right in front of us.

                     TALLEY
           Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's
           name.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the
           minimart.

                     TALLEY
           Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a
           crime scene like that.  Put a unit out
           there.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           We only have eight officers on duty,
           Chief.

More sirens are approaching, but their help seems too little,
too late.  Talley stares up the cul-de-sac at the Smiths'
house as if this was a terrible nightmare --

                     TALLEY
               (to himself)
           That's not enough.

                     LOUISE
           What's that, Chief?  Say again.

                     TALLEY
           Get everyone out here.  Then call the
           Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible
           hostage situation.

INT. WALTER SMITH'S OFFICE -- DAY

Gunsmoke fills the air.  Kevin is freaking.  He throws a
magazine at Mars --

                     KEVIN
           We could've gone out the back!  You
           didn't have to shoot!

                     DENNIS
           Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev!
           They're already behind us!

                     KEVIN
           We should give up.  All we're doing is
           making it worse.

                     JENNIFER 
           Get out of our house!

Her voice cuts through the din.

Jennifer and Thomas are huddled with their father on the
floor, Jennifer's arms crossed to cover herself --

                     WALTER
               (softly)
           Quiet, Jen.

                     JENNIFER 
           Why don't they go?!  Why don't they leave
           us alone and go?!

Dennis charges up to her, screaming and waving his gun --

                     DENNIS
           Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!

Walter Smith slowly stands --

                     WALTER
           None of you will get out of this.

Dennis spins toward Walter, leveling his gun --

                     DENNIS
           Stay down!  Stay down, goddamnit!

                     WALTER
           I'm going to my desk.

                     DENNIS
           You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the
           fuckin' floor!

Dennis raises the gun to Walter's face.  Walter is in
complete command of himself and nowhere near scared, but
Jennifer grabs his legs --

                     JENNIFER
           Daddy, don't!

                     WALTER
               (casually; to Dennis)
           Take it easy, son.  I'm only going to my
           desk.

Walter eases past Dennis, who doesn't know what to do --

                     DENNIS
           Get on the floor!

                     WALTER
           I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers
           and judges who can help you.

Walter slips open the center drawer.  Dennis thinks that
Walter might go for a gun.  He screams louder and aims
between Walter's eyes --

                     DENNIS
           I'll fuckin' kill you!

                     JENNIFER AND THOMAS
           Daddy!  Please!

Walter checks that the computer disks are in the disk case.
We can see their names clearly:  MARLON and AL.  He drops the
case into the drawer, then lifts out a thick booklet --

                     WALTER
           This is every criminal lawyer in 
           California.  If you give up now, right 
           now, I'll buy you the best lawyer in the
           state.

Dennis slaps the book aside, even more angry --

                     DENNIS
           We just killed a cop!  We killed a fat
           chinaman!  We'll get the death penalty!

Dennis suddenly screams at Mars and Kevin --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the
           back of the house!

                     WALTER
           You won't die if you let me help.

                     DENNIS
           Bullshit!

                     WALTER
           But if you stay in this house, I can
           promise you this --

                     DENNIS
               (shouting over him)
           Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor!

                     WALTER
           You can't imagine the fucking you're
           going to get.

Dennis snaps.  He swings the gun hard and smashes Walter on
the temple.  Walter drops like a rock.

                     JENNIFER
           Leave him alone!!

Jennifer rushes to her father's side, but Walter's out cold --

EXT. TALLEY'S CAR -- THE INTERSECTION -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

Talley is at his car with Anders and two other officers,
Leigh Metzger, a woman in her early thirties, and Cliff
Campbell, a slender guy who looks like a retired security
cop.  Talley is getting information reports both in person
and over the radio --

                     ANDERS
               (referring to notes)
           The house belongs to Walter and Pamela
           Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl
           about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer
           and Thomas.

                     TALLEY
           That would be the girl who opened the
           door.  Are the others inside?

                     ANDERS
           The mother is in Florida visiting her
           sister.  The father works at home, so
           he's probably inside.

Talley keys his mike --

                     TALLEY
               (into his mike)
           Louise?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Go, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Get a phone number for the Smiths.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
               (from the radio)
           Chief, Mikkelson.

                     TALLEY
           Go, Mickey.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           The truck is registered to Dennis James
           Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has
           an Agua Dulce address.

                     TALLEY
           Contact the landlord.  I want to know
           employment, friends, family, anything we
           can find out about this guy.

A news helicopter swoops overhead in a tight turn.  The cops
look up --

                     CAMPBELL
           What in hell is that?

                     TALLEY
               (grimly)
           News hawks.  There'll be more.  They
           monitor our frequencies.

Talley realizes that his officers are staring at the
helicopter as if they've never seen one; these people have
never dealt with a crime this large, and have probably never
even seen a felon.  Talley keys the mike again --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Everyone be cool.  That's our job right 
           now--stabilize the situation and don't 
           let things get out of hand.  All we have
           to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take
           over.  That's all we have to do.

No one looks particularly convinced --

                     METZGER
           How do we do that?

                     TALLEY
           That's my job, Metzger.  That's why I get
           the big bucks.

Talley puts away his mike --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- DAY

Jennifer and Thomas are bent over their father, wanting to
help but not knowing how.  Walter's eyes flicker as if he's
dreaming, and the lump on his head is bleeding --

                     JENNIFER
           He's not waking up.  He should be awake.

Jennifer abruptly stands and faces Dennis --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           He needs a doctor.

                     DENNIS
           Shut up and sit down.  You think
           someone's gonna make a house call?

Jennifer is scared--really, really scared--but she doesn't
sit down.  Both Dennis and Mars are staring at her.  She
feels naked and vulnerable.  She crosses her arms again --

                     JENNIFER 
           At least let me get some ice for his
           head.

Dennis finally relents and shrugs at Mars --

                     DENNIS
           Make sure Kevin isn't fucking off back
           there.

Jennifer hurries out as Mars follows --

INT. THE KITCHEN -- DAY

Jennifer goes to the counter.  Kevin is at the French doors,
nervous and scared; Mars is a dark shadow behind her --

She kneels to a low cabinet when Mars kicks it shut --

                     MARS
           I thought you wanted ice.

Mars towers over her, his groin inches from her face --

                     JENNIFER
           I'm getting a wash cloth for the ice.

Mars gazes down at her, enjoying his size and power.  He
steps closer, bringing his groin closer to his face.
Jennifer stands, holding her arms across her breasts --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Please get away from me.

                     KEVIN
               (from the background)
           Mars?  What are you doing?

Kevin's intrusion shatters the moment.  Jennifer quickly
snatches a wash cloth from the cabinet, then takes an ice
tray from the freezer and brings it back to the counter --

As Jennifer puts ice in the wash cloth, she sees the paring
knife that she used for the sandwiches partially hidden by
paper towels --

She glances at Kevin, but cannot see Mars; he's at the
refrigerator behind her.  Jennifer slowly reaches for the
knife --

                     MARS 
           Hey.

Jennifer freezes, terrified.  She pushes the knife behind the
Cuisinart to hide it, then turns.  Mars is offering her a
beer.

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           Want one?

                     JENNIFER
           I don't drink beer.

                     MARS
           Mommy won't know.  You can do anything
           you want right now.  Mommy won't know.

                     JENNIFER
           What I want is to help my father.

Jennifer hurries past him and disappears down the hall.  Even
as she leaves the phone starts ringing --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- DAY

The phone seems to ring louder here.  Dennis stands over it,
watching the phone as if it's alive.  The phone rings again 
and again.  Finally, he answers --

                     DENNIS
           Hello?

EXT. TALLEY'S CAR -- IN THE CUL-DE-SAC -- DAY

Talley is once more behind his car.  He's on his cell phone,
with Jorgenson nearby --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           My name is Jeff Talley.  Is this Dennis
           Rooney?

Intercut Dennis on the phone in Walter's office --

                     DENNIS
           You with the cops?

                     TALLEY
           The Bristo Police Department.  Look out
           the window.  You see the car?

Dennis peers through the shutters --

                     DENNIS
           Yeah.  I'm Rooney.

                     TALLEY
           We had an awful lot of shooting.  You
           need a doctor in there?

Dennis shoots a guilty glance at Walter, then lies --

                     DENNIS
           We're cool.

                     TALLEY
           Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to
           hear it from him.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You
           talk to me.

                     TALLEY
           How about your two friends?  You don't
           have a man dying in there, do you?

                     DENNIS
           They're fine.

Talley cups the phone to tell Jorgenson --

                     TALLEY
           All three subjects are confirmed inside.
           Call off the house-to-house.
               (back to the phone)
           Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your
           situation --

                     DENNIS
               (interrupting)
           You don't have to explain shit!  That
           Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for
           it.  That Chinaman shot himself.

                     TALLEY
           Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.

                     DENNIS
           How about the cop?

                     TALLEY
           Dennis?  I want you to release those
           people.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck that.  They're the only thing
           stopping you from blowing us away.

                     TALLEY
           We're not coming in there by force, okay?
           No one wants to hurt you.

                     DENNIS
           I got these people!  You try to come get
           me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!

The phone clicks in Talley's ear as Dennis slams down the
phone --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- AT THAT MOMENT

Dennis is livid with fear and rage.  He paces through the
office like a trapped cat --

                     DENNIS
           That fuckin' Chinaman is dead!  That's
           murder-one, dude.  That's the needle!

Kevin appears in the entry, drawn by Dennis's raving --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Get back where you belong, asshole!
           Mars, keep and eye on the cops; I gotta
           find a way out of here --

Dennis shoves Kevin out of the office and stalks after him --

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- DAY

Kevin dogs along beside Dennis, speaking softly so that Mars
doesn't overhear --

                     KEVIN
           I have to tell you something --

                     DENNIS
           We gotta find a way outta here is what we
           gotta do!

                     KEVIN
           It's about Mars --

They reach the master bedroom suite, a huge room with sliding
glass doors that overlook the pool --

                     KEVIN (CONT'D)
           That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied.
           He just started shooting!

                     DENNIS
           Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?

                     KEVIN
           I was there, Dennis!  I saw!  It's like
           he wanted to shoot that cop.

                     DENNIS
           You're being stupid.  Check out the
           bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a
           window --

Dennis shoves Kevin toward the bathroom, then steps into --

INT. THE SECURITY CLOSET -- DAY

One side is filled with racks of clothes, but the opposite 
side is an industrial bank of video monitors showing a dozen
views of the house, both inside and out --

Dennis sees this stuff and stops in his tracks, awed --

                     DENNIS
           Kev.

Kevin steps in beside him.

                     KEVIN
           Jesus.  What is this?

                     DENNIS
           Are you totally stupid?  What does it
           look like?

One monitor shows Mars and the Smiths in the office, another
the kitchen, another Jennifer's room, another the front of
the house, the rear, the sides--every room and most of the
exterior can be seen --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Look, that's the master bedroom out here.

Dennis goes out into the master, looking for the camera, and
appears on the bedroom monitor --

                     KEVIN
           I can see you!

Dennis steps back into the closet, and this time he examines
the door.  He closes it enough to reveal thick throw-bolts --

                     DENNIS
           Dude, this is solid steel.  They gotta be
           hiding something.

Dennis glances over to his brother, and finds Kevin on his
knees with two black travel bags beneath the clothes --

                     KEVIN
           Dennis --

Kevin pushes the clothes aside to reveal an open bag.  It's
filled with hundred dollar bills.  Dennis kneels beside his
brother and opens the second bag.  It's filled with hundred
dollar bills, too --

                     DENNIS
           Go get Mars.

INT. MRS. PENA'S FAMILY ROOM -- DAY -- ON A TELEVISION

We're watching a grainy black and white security tape of
Junior Kim's robbery/homicide.  It shows Kim behind the
counter as Dennis and Mars enter --

                     MIKKELSON
           One in front is Dennis James Rooney.

Talley, Mikkelson, Dreyer, and Anders are watching the tape,
which is currently being played in the home of Mrs. Estelle
Pena, who lives two blocks from the Smiths.

Mikkelson is a tall, strong woman; Dreyer is her opposite, a 
short, dumpy man --

                     MIKKELSON (CONT'D)
           Dennis has a younger brother, Kevin Paul--
           that's him entering now, the third guy.

                     TALLEY
           Has Dennis done time?

                     MIKKELSON
           Just pulled thirty days for misdemeanor
           burglary.  He shows car theft,
           shoplifting, and DUI.

Talley steps closer to the television, and taps Mars --

                     TALLEY
           Who's this?

                     DREYER
           We don't know.

                     TALLEY
           Have still prints made from the tape.
           Show the landlord.  Maybe we can get a
           fast ID.

Talley looks closer.  With the way Mars is positioned, we can
see part of the tattoo on his head --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Here on his head.  Is that a tattoo?

                     MIKKELSON
           I can't make it out.

                     TALLEY
           Says...burn it.

On the tape, Kim slumps to the floor.  Dennis vaults across
the counter and runs to the door.  Mars, however, calmly
picks up Kim's gun and leans across the counter.  We couldn't
see this before, but now we see a strange smile play over his
face --

                     DREYER
           What's he doing? 

                     TALLEY
           He's watching Kim die.

Talley watches Mars, and knows that this guy is seriously
disturbed.  He is still watching the tape when Leigh Metzger
calls from the door --

                     METZGER
           Chief?

Talley turns.  Metzger is with Amanda and Jane --

EXT. MRS. PENA'S HOUSE -- DAY

Talley, Jane, and Amanda are walking to the street.  Amanda
is excited; she thinks this is cool --

                     AMANDA
           Are men with guns really barricaded in a
           house?

                     TALLEY
           Just around the corner and up that
           street.  See the helicopters?

Five news choppers now hover high over the house.  The crime
scene is only two blocks away.  Close.

                     JANE
           Wait by the car, Mandy.  Give me a minute
           with Dad.

They wait until Amanda is gone, then --

                     TALLEY
               (apologizing)
           I should've called.  This thing broke
           right after we spoke, then everything
           happened so fast --

                     JANE
           Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?

                     TALLEY
           The Sheriffs will take over when they get
           here.

                     JANE
           But they're not here yet.  Tell me about
           you.

Jane touches his arm --

                     JANE (CONT'D)
           Jesus, you're shaking.

Self-conscious, Talley moves away so that he's out of reach --

                     TALLEY
           Why don't you guys grab some dinner at
           the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as
           soon as I can.

                     JANE
           You sure?

                     TALLEY
           I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.

                     JANE
           I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.

Talley gives her a gentle nod, then watches her walk away
until --

                     TALLEY
           Jane?

She turns back, her eyes asking 'what?'

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I'm scared shitless.

                     JANE
           That's okay.  I love you anyway.

Talley and Jane share the moment, and then she walks away.

EXT. YORK ESTATES -- DAY

A news chopper swings by overhead bringing us to the main
entrance of York Estates.  The entrance has been blocked, and
cars are being turned away, so traffic is backed up both ways
along the street --

INT. GLEN HOWELL'S CAR -- DAY

Glen Howell is a nice-looking man in his early forties:
Sport coat, gold Rolex, deep tan.  He hammers the horn of his
Mercedes S600 sedan, but it does no good; traffic is frozen --

A news van trying to work up the line pulls alongside, then
gets jammed by the crunch like everyone else.  Howell rolls
down the window --

                     HOWELL
           Hey, you guys know what's going on?

An attractive Asian-American reporter leans from her window
to answer --

                     REPORTER
           Three men took a family hostage.

                     HOWELL
           Jesus, no shit?  My client lives in
           there.

The reporter checks her notes --

                     REPORTER
           It's a family named Smith, Walter and
           Pamela Smith.  Do you know them?

Howell stares at her emptily, then shakes his head --

                     HOWELL
           No.  No, I don't know them.  Thanks for
           your time.

Howell pulls a U-turn to get out of traffic.  He flips open
his cell phone and presses the speed dial --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
               (into his phone)
           We have a problem out here.

INT. SONNY BENZA'S OFFICE -- PALM SPRINGS -- DAY

We're in a palatial home on the ridge overlooking Palm
Springs.  On the cut, Sonny Benza, Phil Tuzee, and Charlie
Fischer are watching TV news coverage of the situation in
Bristo Camino --

                     TUZEE
           Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The
           detectives come out with Smith's
           computer, and we go directly to jail, do
           not pass Go.

                     BENZA
           Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.

                     TUZEE
           I took the call from Glen personally.
           They're still in Smith's house.

Fischer tries being positive --

                     FISCHER
           Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's
           three kids.  They'll give up, the cops
           will arrest them, and that's that.  Why
           would they search the house?

                     BENZA
           You think we should take that chance?

                     FISCHER
               (on the spot)
           I guess not.

                     BENZA
           I guess not, too.  How much information
           is in the house?

                     TUZEE
           Smith was cooking the books for the IRS.
           That means he has it all:  The cash flow,
           where it comes from, how we launder it,
           our split with the East.

                     FISCHER
           It's on two computer disks he calls
           Marlon and Al.

                     BENZA
           What, he's cute?  That's his idea of
           humor?

                     FISCHER
           If the Feds get those disks, the East
           Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You
           should let them know.

                     BENZA
           No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is
           gonna handle this from back there.

                     TUZEE
           You should warn them, Sonny.
 
                     BENZA
           Fuck them!  Now get your head in the
           game, Phil--we have to handle this.

Benza turns back to the television --

                     BENZA (CONT'D)
           Put our people on the scene.  Smith might
           talk just to cut a break for his kids.

                     TUZEE
           He knows better than that.

                     BENZA 
           Bullshit--a man will do anything to save
           his family.  Who's running the show up
           there?

                     FISCHER
           They have a chief of police, a guy named
           Talley.  I saw him being interviewed.

The television suddenly shows Talley making a statement.  He
looks tired and haggard --

                     FISCHER
               (pointing)
           Hey, that's him.  That's Talley right
           there!

Benza studies Talley, then looks at his lieutenants --

                     BENZA
           Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end
           of the day, I want to own him.

                     TUZEE
           It's happening right now.

That's exactly what Benza wanted to hear.

EXT. THE DESERT ROSE MOTEL -- DAY

A low-rent motel on the road between Bristo Camino and
Newhall.  Glen Howell's Mercedes is parked on the side, along
with several other cars.

It's late-afternoon going into evening.  The sun is sinking 
fast --

INT. HOWELL'S ROOM -- DAY

Howell is being briefed by his operators, four men and two
women.  There's a minimum of bullshit; these people are
professionals --

Ken Seymore is an intense, compact man who talks fast --

                     SEYMORE
           L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a
           bank robbery in Pico Rivera.

                     HOWELL
           Give me an ETA.

                     SEYMORE
           An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.

Duane Manelli speaks up --

                     MANELLI
           When the Sheriffs get here, how many we
           looking at?

                     SEYMORE
               (checking his notes)
           A command team, a negotiating team, a
           tactical team--the tac team includes a
           perimeter team, the assault team, 
           snipers, and breachers--thirty-five new
           bodies.

                     HOWELL
           How many locals?

Gayle Devarona, one of the women, leans forward --

                     DEVARONA
           Fourteen officers and two civilians.  I
           have their names and most of their
           addresses.

She tosses a yellow legal pad onto the table --

                     HOWELL
           And Talley?

                     DEVARONA
           Married but separated, ex-LAPD.  The fam
           doesn't live here, but they're coming up
           today.  I got his address there.

                     MANELLI
           The cops I talked to, they said Talley
           was a hostage negotiator in LA.

                     DEVARONA
           His last three years on the job.  Before
           that, he was SWAT.

Mike Ruiz joins in --

                     RUIZ
           How's a SWAT negotiator make it up here
           to this shithole?

                     DEVARONA
           I make him for a stress release.

                     HOWELL
           Good work, Gayle--everybody.  Now stay
           ahead of the curve.  I want to know
           everything that happens before it
           happens.  I'll cover Talley.

Howell tears Talley's address off the yellow pad.  This
meeting is over --

                     SEYMORE
           What if it goes south?

                     HOWELL
           What do you mean?

                     SEYMORE
           If things get wet, we're going to need
           someone who can handle that end.

                     HOWELL
           You worry about your end.  I got my side
           covered.

Howell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door.

EXT. DONUT SHOP -- NEWHALL, CALIFORNIA -- NIGHT

The sun has set.  The donut shop glows greasily at the end of
a strip mall.  It is empty except for the overweight woman
behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth --

INT. THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT

The man in the booth is named Marion Clewes.  He's an average
looking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his
right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J.
C. Penney shirt.  His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not
so much as you'd notice.  Marion could disappear into a crowd
just by being so ordinary.  That's the point.

A fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with
coarse hair, buzzes past --

Marion watches it, only his eyes moving --

The fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table --

Marion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand
flashes out, slamming down on the table.

He holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly
peeks under his hand --

The fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk.  One
wing beats furiously; the other is broken --

Marion examines his hand.  A smear of fly goo and a single
black leg streaks his third finger.  Marion touches his
tongue to the smear --

The woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening
with disgust --

Marion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and
uses his right to break away another leg.  He eats this leg,
too --

The woman disappears into the rear --

Headlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around
to see Howell's Mercedes pull up --

Marion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen
Howell takes a seat across from him.  Howell puts the yellow
slip with Talley's address on the table --

                     HOWELL
           Talley lives here.  I don't know if the
           place has security or not.

                     MARION
           It won't be a problem.

                     HOWELL
           He has a wife and kid.  That's how
           we'll get to him.

                     MARION
           Okey-doke.

                     HOWELL
           We have to own this guy, Marion.  We
           don't want him dead; we need to use him.

Marion puts Talley's address into his pocket.

                     MARION
           Can we make him dead after we use him?

Glen Howell slides out of the booth without answering.
Marion creeps him out --

                     HOWELL
           Whatever you want.  Page me when you're
           done.

Howell starts away, then turns back --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
           Donuts here any good?

                     MARION
           I don't eat junk food.

Howell frowns like he might've known, then walks away.
Marion turns back to the fly --

It lays there, still, until Marion prods it.  The remaining
wing flutters --

Marion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too.

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light
as she reports --

                     METZGER
           PacBell shows six lines into the house.
           They blocked all six like you wanted.

                     TALLEY
           I have the only number that can call into
           the house?

                     METZGER
           Yes, sir.  They'll only accept calls from
           your cell.

                     TALLEY
           Way to go.

They arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a
slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill --

                     ANDERS
           Chief, this is Brad Dill.  Dennis and
           Kevin work for him.

                     DILL
           I didn't know anything about this.  I
           didn't know what they were gonna do.

                     TALLEY
           Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what
           they were going to do until they did it.
           I want you to take a look at something.

Metzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior
Kim's security tape --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Can you identify this man?

                     DILL
           That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he
           works for me, too.

                     TALLEY
               (to Metzger)
           Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek'
           through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list
           the tattoo as an identifier.

Metzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot-
           tempered?  Anything like that?

                     DILL
           Keeps to himself, more like.

                     TALLEY
           You have his address?

                     DILL
           Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --

Dill pulls out a tattered address book.  Talley hands the
book to Anders, who copies the address --

                     TALLEY
               (to Anders)
           Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a
           telephonic search warrant.  When you get
           the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer
           search his house.

                     ANDERS
           Yes, sir.

Anders turns away as Metzger calls from Mrs. Pena's door --

                     METZGER
           Chief!  The Sheriffs are ten minutes out!

Talley has wanted to hear that, but now his sense of relief
is tempered by something he did not expect:  Loss.

Talley keys his shoulder mike --

                     TALLEY
               (into his radio)
           Louise?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Go, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Call Jane for me.  She's at the little
           Thai place.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           I know the one.

                     TALLEY
           Tell her I'm almost home.

INT. SMITH'S SECURITY CLOSET -- NIGHT

Dennis is on the floor with the money, touching it, feeling
it, smelling it.  Mars is standing over him, profoundly
unmoved --

                     DENNIS
           There's gotta be a million bucks here.
           Maybe two million!

Mars turns away from the money to consider the monitors and
the door --

                     MARS
           It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks
           into your house, you can hide.

                     DENNIS
           Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the
           cash!  We're rich.

                     MARS
           We're trapped in a house.

Mars walks away --

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Dennis and Mars are returning to the front of the house,
Dennis irritated at Mars's lack of enthusiasm --  

                     DENNIS
           We can take it with us.

                     MARS
           You can't run with suitcases.

Dennis grabs Mars by the arm, stopping him --

                     DENNIS
           Then we'll stuff it up our asses.  This
           is the payoff.  This is every dream you
           ever had, all in those two bags.

Mars continues on without responding, Dennis angrily
following --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Kevin is grimly watching news coverage of their standoff as
Mars and Dennis enter.  A female anchor is reporting on the
events at York Estates with Dennis's booking photo cut into
the picture --

                     ANCHOR
               (from the tube)
           -- thought to be Dennis James Rooney.
           Rooney was recently released from the
           Antelope Valley Correctional Institute
           where he served time for robbery.

Dennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big
smile --

                     DENNIS
               (thrilled)
           Check me out!  I look like fuckin' Jon
           Bon Jovi.

Kevin is anything but thrilled --

                     KEVIN
           Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. 
           We won't be able to hide. 

                     DENNIS
           Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need
           anti-depressants.

Across the room, Walter Smith shudders and moans; his face is
swollen and covered with clammy sweat --

Jennifer is sick with worry and can't stand seeing her father
like this --

                     JENNIFER
           My father needs a doctor.  Please.

                     DENNIS
           Hey, I've got a situation here, in case
           you haven't noticed.

                     JENNIFER
           All you're doing is watching yourself on
           TV.  Look at him.

                     DENNIS
           Use more ice.

                     JENNIFER
           I'm getting a doctor!

Jennifer lurches to her feet and runs toward the front door.
Dennis catches her in two steps and backhands her exactly the
way his old man used to smack his old lady, knocking her to
the floor --

                     THOMAS
           Jen!!!

Thomas charges into Dennis like an angry midget.  Kevin jumps
between them --

                     KEVIN
           Stop it!  Stop it, Dennis!  Jesus!

Mars steps forward and jerks Thomas into the air.  Mars'
physical presence is suddenly so imposing that everyone stops
fighting --

                     MARS
               (quietly)
           We should tie them.  We can put them
           upstairs out of the way.

It takes Dennis a moment to come up to speed with that, but
then he nods --

                     DENNIS
           That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.

                     MARS
               (to Kevin)
           Find something:  Extension cords, rope,
           wire--we'll have to tie them tight.

                     DENNIS
           Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand
           there.
               (waves at Walter)
           And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want
           him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.

Mars nods his approval.  Subtly, there is the beginning of a
shift in power --

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Mars pushes Jennifer inside.  Kevin follows her with duct 
tape and a couple of extension cords.  Mars, holding Thomas,
pauses in the hall --

                     MARS
           Tie her to the chair.  I'll take care of
           the windows when I finish with the boy.

Mars disappears with Thomas down the hall.  Jennifer stands
by the chair, arms once more crossed over her breasts. 
Kevin can see that she's scared.  He takes a T-shirt from 
where she's left it on the floor and hands it to her --

                     KEVIN
           Here.  Put this on.

She pulls it over her head --

                     KEVIN (CONT'D)
           You gotta pee?

                     JENNIFER
           I don't see why you can't just lock me
           in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.

                     KEVIN
           Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will
           tie you.  Which do you want?

Jennifer sits.  Kevin pulls her hands behind the back of the
chair.  As he ties her, Jennifer decides that if any of them
can be reached, it's Kevin --

                     JENNIFER
           Thanks for the shirt.

                     KEVIN
           Whatever.

                     JENNIFER
           Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
                     
                     KEVIN
           He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked
           out.

                     JENNIFER
           If my father dies they'll charge you with
           his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see
           that?

Kevin leans back.  He knows she's right, but he doesn't
believe he can do anything about it --

                     KEVIN
           I can't make Dennis see anything.

A shadow moves behind Kevin.  It's Mars, standing in the
door.  He holds up a wicked claw hammer --

                     MARS
           Look what I found.

He enters and tests at Jennifer's binds --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           You tied her like a pussy.  Make it
           tight.

As Kevin reties the bindings, Mars rips the phone from the
wall.  He smashes the phone jack with the hammer, crushing
it.  Then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into
the sill, nailing the window closed --

Mars returns to Jennifer and once more checks her binds --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           Better.

He tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her
mouth --

                     KEVIN
           Make sure she can breathe.

Mars rubs his fingers hard over the tape covering her mouth.
He massages the tape into her skin, slow, sensual --

                     MARS
           Go downstairs, Kevin.

Jennifer looks at Kevin, her eyes pleading that he not leave,
but Kevin is cowed; he leaves --

Jennifer looks back at Mars --

Mars leans close to her.  She is terrified that he is going
to kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           I want to show you something.

Mars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to
expose his chest.  A large tattoo in flowing script is lined
across his body:  A Mother's Son.

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           It cost two hundred forty dollars, but I
           was happy to spend it.  I love my mom.
           You see these?

Mars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if
he were diseased.  He fingers the lumps sensuously as if
touching them excites him --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           My mom burned me with cigarettes.

Jennifer is both disgusted and terrified.  Mars stares at her
emptily for another moment, then lowers his shirt and leaves 
without another word.

INT. THOMAS'S ROOM -- NIGHT

The room is dark.  Thomas is tied firmly to the bed.  The 
cords cut into Thomas's wrists and Thomas can't reach the
knots, but Mars made one mistake:  He tied Thomas to the
headboard posts, and one of the newels has been loose for
years --

Thomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel, then
twists it back and forth.  He works it harder and harder
until the newel slides off its pin, and suddenly his hand is
free, though still tied to the newel --

Thomas peels the tape from his mouth, then unties the
remaining binds and frees himself from the newel.  He slips
off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet --

INT. THOMAS'S CLOSET -- NIGHT

A service hatch that opens into the attic crawlspace is built
into the wall beneath Thomas's clothes.  Thomas prys open the
hatch, then reaches inside for a small flashlight.  He flicks 
it on, then climbs into the eaves of the roof --

INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

The crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the
edge of the roof.  It was built for plumbers and air
conditioning technicians, but Thomas has taken the space for
his own:  Witness the stack of Penthouse, pictures of sports
heroes tacked to the rafters, and old soda cans strewn 
between the joists --

Thomas scurries quietly through the tunnel, heading for --

INT. JENNIFER'S CLOSET -- NIGHT

Thomas pushes through a hatch identical to the one in his own
closet, then creeps to the door --

                     THOMAS
               (whispers)
           Jen!

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer twists around to see him, mumbling through the tape --

                     THOMAS
           Sit still!  If they're in the security
           room, they can see you on the monitors.

Jennifer quiets.  Thomas slips out of the closet and creeps
toward her along the wall --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           I figured out what these cameras can see
           last year when Mom and Dad went to Lake
           Arrowhead.  It can't see me over here,
           but it's looking at you, so don't move!

Thomas reaches up from behind Jennifer and jerks the tape off
her mouth --

                     JENNIFER
           Ow!  Shit!

                     THOMAS
           Be quiet!  Listen!

Thomas is hiding behind Jennifer so that the camera cannot
see him --

                     JENNIFER
           No one's coming.

                     THOMAS 
           That big asshole nailed my windows.

                     JENNIFER
           Mine, too.

                     THOMAS
           We can use the crawlspace to get
           downstairs.  Then we can run for it.

                     JENNIFER
           No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with
           them!

Thomas thinks about that and decides that he can't leave
their father, either --

                     THOMAS
           We can't carry him.

                     JENNIFER
           You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll
           stay with Daddy.

                     THOMAS
           I'm not gonna leave you!

                     JENNIFER
           Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help
           the police!

Thomas suddenly realizes what he has to do --

                     THOMAS
           We'll all go, Jennifer.  All of us or 
           none of us.  I know where Daddy keeps a
           gun.

Jennifer jerks so hard that she almost tips over the chair --

                     JENNIFER
               (loud)
           You leave that gun alone!

                     THOMAS
           Shh, they'll hear you!

                     JENNIFER
               (louder)
           Better than you getting killed!  Don't
           touch that gun!  Daddy says --

Thomas slaps the tape back over her mouth.  Jennifer 
struggles helplessly as Thomas slips back into the closet,
and is gone --

EXT. YORK ESTATES -- STREET -- NIGHT

The Sheriff's Crisis Response Team rolls through the streets
like an invading army:  A brown sedan leads a huge van known
as the Mobile Command Post, which is followed by a Sheriff's 
SWAT support vehicle, two SWAT Suburbans, and four radio 
units.

Pools of light from the helicopters follow their progress --

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy
stops.  Up and down the row, uniformed Sheriffs pile out of
their vehicles and off-load their gear --

Two people climb out of the lead car:  Will Maddox, a
bespectacled African-American Sheriff's SWAT negotiator, and
Captain Laura Martin, the CRT commander --

                     TALLEY
           I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?

                     MARTIN
           Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the
           primary negotiator --

                     MADDOX
           Is the perimeter around the house secure?

                     TALLEY
           I've got fourteen officers on my
           department including me.  We're as secure
           as we can be.

                     MADDOX
               (to Martin)
           Permission to deploy the line?

                     MARTIN
           Do it.

                     TALLEY
               (to Maddox)
           Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid
           named Rooney.  He's amped up and
           volatile.

Maddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike --

                     MARTIN
           Sounds like you know the job.

                     TALLEY
           I've done it once or twice.  I blocked
           their phones to incoming calls, so you'll
           have to cut in a hard line to talk to 
           him.

                     MARTIN
               (over her shoulder)
           Maddox!  You got that?

                     MADDOX
           Doing it now!

                     MARTIN
               (back to Talley)
           I'd like you to brief my supervisors
           before we take over the scene.

                     TALLEY
           Whatever you want.

Talley and Martin hurry toward her troops --

INT. THE SMITHS' GARAGE -- NIGHT

The garage is dark, lit only by the light that comes from the
kitchen's open door, as Dennis, Mars and a reluctant Kevin
enter --

                     KEVIN
           Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What
           if he wakes up?

                     DENNIS
               (annoyed)
           That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now
           come here and see this --

Dennis shows them a small casement window, and pushes open
the window to reveal a thick hedge --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
               (excited)
           These bushes follow the wall into the
           neighbor's yard.  All we need is some
           kind of diversion and we're home free.

                     KEVIN
           That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see
           us.

                     DENNIS
           Not if they're looking at something else.

                     KEVIN
           Like what?

                     MARS
           Let's burn the house.

Mars says it so simply that the moment is frozen.  Mars is
holding the big claw hammer, kneading it as if it was a
living thing.  His face is masked by shadows, but his eyes
both glow as if already reflecting flame --

INT. CRAWLSPACE ABOVE THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

We see Dennis, Kevin, and Mars through a slit overhead as
they emerge from the garage and move back into the house --

Thomas is watching them.  He has cracked open the service
hatch in the laundry room ceiling to make sure that his way
is clear --

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

The room is dark.  When Dennis and the others are gone, the
ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas lets himself down.  He slides
onto the washing machine and then to the floor --

Thomas cups one hand over his flashlight and turns it on.  He
lets light leak through his fingers so that he can see.  The
beam cuts across a door to the garage, car keys on key hooks,
and Jennifer's purse hanging from one of the hooks --

INT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

This is a small room off the end of the laundry with a work
bench, a stool, and shelves above the bench for Walter's
hobby supplies --

Thomas shines the light over the shelves, spotting the hard
plastic pistol case on the highest shelf.  That's the target;
that's the goal --

Thomas uses the stool to climb onto the bench --

INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Dennis is in the doorway to the security closet, handing out
one of the money bags to Kevin --

                     KEVIN
           We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.

                     DENNIS
           I've been carrying you our whole fuckin'
           lives.

Kevin drops the bag and tries to reason with his brother --

                     KEVIN
           Everything we're doing is making it
           worse.  You can't let him burn this
           house.

Dennis abruptly grabs Kevin by the throat, his face hard with
fury --

                     DENNIS
           Nothing's worse than listening to you.
           I'm warning you, Kevin--stop holding me
           back.  Now you pick up that fuckin' money
           and get ready to go.

Dennis glares at Kevin another moment, then lets go and steps
back into the closet --

INT. THE CLOSET -- NIGHT

Dennis lifts the second bag of cash when the monitors catch
his eye:  The Sheriffs SWAT unit can be seen moving into
position.  Dennis totally freaks --

                     DENNIS
           They're coming!  Kev, Mars, they're
           coming!!!

Dennis drops the cash and bolts out of the closet --

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Mars is placing two buckets of gasoline in the hall as Dennis
and Kevin pound down the hall --

                     DENNIS
           The cops are comin'!

                     MARS
           I got the gasoline --

                     DENNIS
           We don't have time!

Dennis runs to the French doors.  He sees lights at the rear
of the property and SHOOTS through the glass --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Get the kids!  They're our only chance!

Dennis FIRES AGAIN and runs for the stairs --

INT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is straining to reach the pistol which is a fraction
of an inch beyond his grasp when he hears Dennis shouting --

Thomas glances helplessly at the gun case--so near, yet so
far--then scrambles off the bench and --

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when he once more
sees Jennifer's purse hanging on a key hook --

Thomas jumps from the washer, grabs the purse, then scrambles
into the ceiling as GUNSHOTS ECHO through the house --

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Martin, Maddox, and her supervisors are gathered around
Talley when the gunshots crack across the neighborhood --

                     TALLEY
               (startled)
           Who's that shooting?  Martin, what's
           going on?

Radio transmissions crackle over Martin's radio --

                     RADIO VOICES
           Shots fired!  We are taking fire on the
           back wall!

Talley immediately knows what's happening, and he knows why --

                     TALLEY
           They're too close!  I told you not to
           crowd him!  Pull back your people; do not
           breach that house!

Talley sprints toward the cul-de-sac --

INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

Thomas races through the narrow black tunnel.  He slips off
the rafters and almost falls through the ceiling.  He's
losing precious time --

INT. THE STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

Dennis and Mars pound up the stairs, getting closer to his
room --

INT. THE CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

Thomas pushes his way into his closet --

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Dennis and Mars reach the second floor --

INT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas scrambles into bed just before Dennis jerks open the
door.  Dennis drags him off the bed and carries him out of
the room --

EXT. CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley, Martin, and Maddox run into position behind a
Sheriff's unit where a deputy has set up the dedicated crisis
phone --

Talley grabs up the phone --

                     TALLEY
               (to the deputy)
           This thing good?

Talley doesn't wait for the confused deputy to answer; he
presses the button in the handle that dials the phone --

                     MADDOX
           What in hell are you doing?  He's
           shooting at my men!

The phone rings in Talley's ear --

                     TALLEY
               (to Maddox)
           Then get your men off the wall!
               (to Martin)
           You breach that house, we're gonna have a
           bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain --
           I can talk to him.

                     MARTIN
               (to Maddox)
           Order your men to stand down.

The phone is still ringing.  Talley pulls the mike from the
deputy's car and speaks over the public address --

                     TALLEY
               (over the p.a.)
           Look out the window, Dennis.  We are NOT
           entering the house.  We're pulling back.

INT. SMITH'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Dennis is holding Thomas around the neck, using the boy as a
shield.  Kevin is cowering on the floor and Mars is holding
Jennifer.  Dennis snatches up the phone --

                     DENNIS
               (screaming into the phone)
           You fuck!  I got a fuckin' gun to this
           kid's head!  I'll kill'm, you fuck!

Intercut Talley outside --

                     TALLEY
           It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt
           anyone.

                     DENNIS
               (still screaming)
           We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I
           got gasoline all over in here!

Talley takes a deep breath; he forces himself to speak
quietly, calmly --

                     TALLEY
           No one's coming in.  A couple of guys out
           here got carried away.

Dennis peers out the front.  Talley's careful manner is
calming him --

                     DENNIS
           Goddamned right they got carried away.
           It looks like an army out there.

Talley mutes the phone to speak to Martin --

                     TALLEY
               (to Martin)
           It's over.  He's cooling off.

Talley glances at Maddox.  Maddox nods, his expression saying
that Talley was right --

                     DENNIS
           Talley?

                     TALLEY
               (back into the phone)
           I'm here.

                     DENNIS
           I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.

                     TALLEY
           That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They
           won't give you a helicopter.

                     DENNIS
           I'll give you these people.

                     TALLEY
           The Mexican police would arrest you as
           soon as it landed.  There's only one way
           out and you're doing it right now--just
           keep talking to us.
               (mutes phone; to Martin and
                Maddox)
           I think we could make the transition now.
           Maddox, you good to go?

Maddox nods at Martin; he's good to go --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (to Dennis)
           Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a
           personal secret?

                     DENNIS
               (hesitantly)
           What?

                     TALLEY
           I gotta piss real bad.

Dennis can't help himself; he laughs --

                     DENNIS
           You're a funny guy, Talley.

                     TALLEY
           I'm going to put on an officer named Will
           Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.

Talley hands the phone to Maddox, who moves past Talley for a
better view of the house.  Talley looks grimly at Martin --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           He says he has gasoline set to burn the
           place.

                     MARTIN
           Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the
           cars.

                     TALLEY
           If you go in, you can't use tear gas or
           flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.

                     MARTIN
               (not without humor)
           Looks like you're bailing out at the
           right time.

                     TALLEY
               (returns her smile)
           That's why you get the big bucks,
           Captain.

Talley is moving away when his radio pops --

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Chief, base.

                     TALLEY
               (keying his shoulder mike) 
           Go.

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the
           restaurant.

                     TALLEY
           You have her cell number?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           She didn't answer.

                     TALLEY
           They might be at the house.  Keep trying
           and let me know.  I'm going to be here a
           little while longer.

Talley closes his phone and continues away --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Dennis and Kevin are at the television, watching an aerial
view of the Sheriffs deploying around the house.  Jennifer
and Thomas are huddled by their father --

                     KEVIN
           We're surrounded.  They're all over the
           neighborhood.

Mars enters carrying candles and flashlights.  He lights a
candle and place it on a table --

                     DENNIS
           What the fuck is that?

                     MARS
           They'll cut the power.

Mars tosses a flashlight to Dennis --

                     JENNIFER
           What about my father?

                     DENNIS
           Aw, Jesus, not more of this.

                     JENNIFER
           Look at him!  I think he's dying!

                     DENNIS
               (to Kevin and Mars)
           Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm
           like before.  That little fuck untied
           himself anyway.

Dennis returns to the shutters as Mars and Kevin take the
kids --

INT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT

Mars shoves Thomas into the room, then lifts the claw hammer.
For an instant, we think he's going to hit the boy--but he
smashes off the door knob, instead.

Mars glares at Thomas, then pulls the door closed.  The knob
on Thomas's side is gone; there's no way for Thomas to open
the door.

But that's okay by Thomas.  He waits until he's sure that
Mars is gone, and then he hurries back to his closet --

INT. THOMAS' CLOSET -- NIGHT

Thomas pulls open the hatch, fishes out his flashlight, then
dumps the contents of Jennifer's purse on the floor.

He picks up her cell phone.

INT. MRS. PENA'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Talley closes his eyes with a blissful expression as a
familiar sound fills the bathroom; he's taking a piss.

His radio crackles --

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Chief, base.

Talley finishes his business, and keys his mike --

                     TALLEY
           Did you find Jane and Mandy?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
           Could you call me back on your phone?
           Right away.

                     TALLEY
           What's wrong with the radio?

                     LOUISE'S VOICE
               (hesitantly)
           Other people can hear us.  Just call.
           Please.

                     TALLEY
           Stand by.

Now Talley is worried.  He pulls out his phone and punches
the speed dial.  It rings only once --

Intercut Louise, at her desk outside Talley's office --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Is something wrong with Jane?

                     LOUISE
           We have a boy on the line.  He says he's
           Thomas Smith and he's calling from the
           house.

                     TALLEY
           It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste
           my time with that!

                     LOUISE
           His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I
           think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy
           is inside that house.

Talley worries it only for a moment --

                     TALLEY
           Put him on.

Talley pushes out of the bathroom into --

INT. MRS. PENA'S FAMILY ROOM -- NIGHT

He flags Leigh Metzger as he cups the phone --

                     TALLEY
               (to Metzger)
           Get Martin.  Right away.

As Metzger hurries away, we intercut Thomas, hiding in the
shadows on his bed, whispering so as not to be overheard --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into the phone)
           This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, 
           son.

                     THOMAS 
           Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on
           TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't
           wake up.  You gotta help him.

Talley can tell by the tremor in the boy's voice--this is for
real --

                     TALLEY
           Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk
           to me.  Was your father shot?

                     THOMAS
           Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and
           he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.

                     TALLEY
           How about you and your sister?

                     THOMAS
           We're okay.

                     TALLEY
           Where are you right now?

                     THOMAS
           In my room.

Talley hurries to a large sketch of the Smiths' floor plan
laid out on the dining room table --

                     TALLEY
           That's on the second floor.  Could you
           climb out your window if we were
           downstairs to catch you?

                     THOMAS
           They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm
           open.

Martin enters with Leigh Metzger.  Talley cups the phone to
give her the headline --

                     TALLEY
               (to Martin)
           I've got the boy on the phone.  He's
           using a cell phone.
               (back to Thomas)
           What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.

                     THOMAS
           If I try to climb out they'll see me on
           the security cameras.  They would see you
           outside, too --

Thomas hears someone outside his door --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           They're coming!

Thomas hangs up, jamming his phone behind the bed --

                     TALLEY
           Thomas?  Thomas...?

Talley lowers the phone --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           He says that his father's hurt.

                     MARTIN
           If we have a man dying in there, we'll
           have to go in.

                     TALLEY
           They have security cameras.  Rooney would
           see you coming.

                     MARTIN
           Did the boy say that any of them are in
           immediate danger?

                     TALLEY
           No.  He said that his father's
           unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.

                     MARTIN
           Then I think we should wait.  Do you
           agree?

Talley finally nods --

                     TALLEY
           You want me to stick around, I could --

                     MARTIN
           You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a
           break.  See your family.  If I need you,
           I'll call.

Talley looks like the most tired guy in the world.  He nods
his good-night, then turns away --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Talley slides into his car outside Mrs. Pena's home.  He's
got a lot on his mind, and not all of it centers around 455
Castle Way.  He punches a number into his cell phone --

He listens to ringing, and then his own voice answers --

                     TALLEY'S VOICE MESSAGE
           This is Jeff Talley.  Leave your name and
           number after the beep.

We hear the beep, then --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Jane?  If you're there, pick up, okay?
           Mandy?

No one answers.  Talley closes his phone, his apprehension
increasing --

EXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT

The Bristo officers manning the gate swing the blockade aside
and wave Talley through --

EXT. MEDIA AREA -- NIGHT

The assembled television microwave vans, radio newsvans, and
reporters are parked together in an empty lot one block from
the front gate.

Ken Seymore steps into the street, speaking into a cell phone
as he watches Talley drive away --

                     SEYMORE
               (into his phone)
           He's leaving now.

EXT. RED LIGHT INTERSECTION -- DAY

A traffic light on the outskirts of town, deserted until
Talley's car pulls to a stop --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Suddenly, two masked men point guns at his head, one from the
driver's side, one from the passengers.  They're wearing
jackets, black ski masks, and gloves.  The man on the
passenger side sports a big gold Rolex, so we'll call him the
Watchman --

                     THE WATCHMAN
               (meaning the gun)
           Do you see the fuckin' gun?!  Look at it!

Talley freezes.  He's been blindsided by this insane shit,
but he knows better than to move --

                     TALLEY
           Take it easy.

The man on the driver's side gets into the backseat, then the
Watchman gets into the passenger side.  The man behind Talley
hooks an arm around Talley's throat while the Watchman 
searches for Talley's gun --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Where's your gun?

                     TALLEY
           I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.

The Watchman nods at the backseater, who releases Talley.

A dark green Mustang roars up ahead of Talley's car.  A 
second car tucks in tight on Talley's rear --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Who are you?

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.

The Mustang pulls out, and Talley follows.

EXT. A DESERTED ALLEY -- NIGHT

The three cars turn into the alley.  They stop, the first and
last cars bumper-to-bumper with Talley's.  The cars are so 
close to Talley that his own vehicle is pinned; he couldn't 
drive away now even if he wanted --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

The Watchman puts Talley's car in park, turns off the
ignition, and takes the key.

                     THE WATCHMAN
           I know you're scared, but unless you do
           something stupid we're not going to hurt
           you.  You understand?

Two more masked men approach from the other cars, one coming
to Talley's window, the other getting into the back seat
behind the Watchman.

                     THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
           Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. 
           Do you understand?

                     TALLEY
           What do you want?

                     THE WATCHMAN
           These guys are going to take hold of you.
           Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.

The three men take hold of Talley, the man behind again
looping his arm around Talley's neck, the other two each
twisting Talley's arms --

                     TALLEY
           What is this?

The Watchman holds a distinctive white cell phone to Talley's
ear --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Say hello.

                     JANE'S VOICE
           Jeff?  Is that you?

Talley goes berserk.  He bucks and tries to pull away, but
the three men hold tight --

The Watchman closes the phone --

                     THE WATCHMAN
               (trying to calm Talley)
           I know, I know--she's all right.  Your
           kid's all right, too.  C'mon, now, relax.
           From this point on, you control what 
           happens to them.

Talley can barely breathe, they're holding him so tight --

                     THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
           Can we let go?  You past your shock and
           all that, we can turn you loose and you
           won't do something stupid?

                     TALLEY
           You can let go.

The Watchman glances at the men; they let go --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Here's the deal--Walter Smith has two
           computer disks like this in his house.
           They're labeled 'Marlon' and 'Al.'

The Watchman holds up a thick black Zip disk.  Talley's
expression tells us that this is the weirdest shit he's ever
heard --

                     TALLEY
           Marlon and Al....

                     THE WATCHMAN
           We want them.  You will not let anyone go
           into that house--or anything come out--
           until my people recover these disks.

                     TALLEY
           I can't control what happens.  The
           Sheriffs are running the scene.

                     THE WATCHMAN
           You will re-assume command.  In two
           hours, a group of my people will arrive
           at York Estates.  You will tell the
           Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical
           team.

The Watchman puts the white cell phone into Talley's hand --

                     THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
           When this phone rings, you answer.  It
           will be me.  I'll tell you what to do.
           When I have what I want, you get your
           family.

                     TALLEY
           You want . . . Marlon and Al.

                     THE WATCHMAN
           I have people in York Estates right under
           your nose.  If you do anything except
           what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and
           Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on 
           that?

                     TALLEY
           These disks . . . where are they?

                     THE WATCHMAN
           Smith will know.

The Watchman and the others get out of Talley's car.  The
doors slam shut.  The Watchman leans in --

                     THE WATCHMAN
           When it rings, answer.

The Watchman tosses the keys into Talley's lap.  We hear car
doors open and close; the cars, front and back, roar to life
and speed away --

Talley focuses on the Mustang's license plate, frantically
scratching down the number --

INT. BRISTO CAMINO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- NIGHT

The place is deserted except for Louise, currently at her
desk to monitor radio communications.

Talley enters, looking as if he's stricken.  Louise can't
help herself but to react --

                     LOUISE
           You look terrible.  Chief, are you all
           right?

Talley barely glances at her, going directly to his office --

INT. TALLEY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Talley steps inside and peels off his uniform shirt.  He
takes a bullet-resistant vest and a black sweatshirt from his
closet.  He straps on the vest, then pulls on the sweatshirt.

Talley sits at his desk and lifts out a ballistic nylon
pistol case from the lower drawer.

He takes out his old SWAT combat piece:  This isn't a pussy
9mm; it's a finely tuned .45-caliber Colt Model 1911.  One
shot, one kill.  Talley ejects the empty magazine, then loads
it with a deadly efficiency.  He slams home the magazine --

Talley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt.  He's
ready to rock.  The camera finds the photograph of Talley
during his days as a SWAT tactical officer --

He was one bad motherfucker.

INT. THE MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley heads for the front door --

                     TALLEY
           I'm going back to York.  Have Larry meet
           me at the front gate.

Talley exits without a backward glance --

EXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT

The helicopters orbit in the distance; the empty lot with the
news vans is in the background.

Talley turns into the development, then stops at the side of
the street where Larry Anders is waiting --

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Anders slides into the passenger seat.  He sees a different
Talley now, focused and grim --

                     ANDERS
           What's up, Chief?

Talley stares at Anders, trying to decide:  Can I trust him?
Will he rat me out to the Watchman and cost the lives of my
wife and child?

                     ANDERS (CONT'D)
           Did I do something wrong?

Talley gives him a slip of paper --

                     TALLEY
           I want you to run this license plate and
           phone number.  Then I want you to find
           out everything you can about Walter
           Smith.
                     ANDERS 
           The guy in the house?

                     TALLEY
           Go back to the office.  Run his name
           through the FBI and the NLETS database.
           I think he's involved with illegal activity
           or he associates with people who are.

Anders glances at the slip again, then tucks it away --

                     ANDERS
           Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not
           Louise, not the other guys, not the
           Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
 
                     ANDERS
           I guess so. 

                     TALLEY
           Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.

                     ANDERS
           I will, Chief.  Absolutely.

                     TALLEY
           Get to work.

Anders climbs out and Talley rockets away --

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley pulls up behind the Sheriffs' command van.  Martin,
surprised to see Talley, steps from the van --

                     TALLEY
           I'm re-assuming command of the scene.
                   
Martin is surprised and angry --

                     MARTIN
           Excuse me?  You requested our help.  You
           turned over command --

                     TALLEY
           And now I'm taking it back.  We're
           getting Smith out of the house.

Talley heads for the cul-de-sac --

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer is on her bed in the darkness, groggy with fear and
fatigue.  She hears someone outside in the hall --

                     JENNIFER
           Thomas?

The door knob rattles.  Jennifer slides out of bed and goes
to the door --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Thomas, is that you?

The door suddenly opens, and Mars is framed in the dim light.
Jennifer jumps back, terrified --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           What do you want?

                     MARS
           We can't make the microwave work.

That seems so outlandish that Jennifer is confused --

                     JENNIFER
           What?

                     MARS
           We're hungry.  You're going to cook.

Mars grabs her hair, and pushes her out the door --

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Mars shoves Jennifer into the kitchen.  Two frozen pizzas are
waiting on the counter --

                     MARS
           Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs
           and hot dogs on mine.

                     JENNIFER
               (under her breath)
           How about dog shit?

Mars takes a carton of eggs and a package of hot dogs from
the refrigerator --

                     MARS
           With hot sauce and butter.

Jennifer takes a bowl from the cupboard.  When she sets down
the bowl, she sees the handle of the paring knife by the food
processor.  Jennifer breaks eggs into the bowl --

                     JENNIFER
           I need a frying pan.  Would you get one?
           Over there, under the range.

As soon as Mars turns away, Jennifer palms the knife and
pushes it into the waist of her shorts --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley joins Maddox behind the car --

                     MADDOX
           What put a wild hair up your ass?

                     TALLEY
           I changed my mind.  That's all you need
           to know.

Talley picks up the dedicated crisis phone that's been cut
into the Smiths' telephone line.  He lifts the receiver and
presses a button.  The phone inside the house rings --

Intercut Dennis inside Smith's office.  He answers --

                     DENNIS
           That you, Talley?

                     TALLEY
           The one and only.  We got a little
           problem out here, Dennis.

                     DENNIS
           You oughta try on the problem I got in
           here.

                     TALLEY
           I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.

Dennis shoots a nervous glance at Walter, who's twitching and
shuddering on the couch --

                     DENNIS
           We been through that.  Forget it.

                     TALLEY
           We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think
           you won't let me talk to Smith because
           he's dead.  They think you murdered him.

Maddox can't believe that Talley is saying this --

                     MADDOX
               (low, so that Dennis can't
                hear)
           What in hell are you doing?!

                     DENNIS
           That's bullshit!  The guy's right here!
           He's alive!

                     TALLEY
               (pressing Dennis harder)
           If you don't let me talk to him, they're
           going to attack the house.

Maddox grabs Talley's arm, his voice a low hiss --

                     MADDOX
           You're gonna set him off, goddamnit!
           That's crazy!

                     DENNIS
               (screaming)
           They better not!

Talley pushes Maddox away and amps the pressure on Dennis --

                     TALLEY
           Help me keep them out!  Let me speak to
           Smith, Dennis.  Let me speak to him right
           now.

Dennis is freaking.  He believes that the Sheriffs are about 
to crash through the doors --

                     DENNIS
           SHIT!!!!

Now Talley throttles back; he senses that Dennis is at the 
breaking point and wants to coax him back from the edge --

                     TALLEY
               (calmer; coaxing)
           Talk to me, Dennis.  Help me help you. 
           Why can't you put Smith on the phone?

Dennis finally makes the admission --

                     DENNIS
               (quietly)
           He got knocked out.  It's like he's
           sleeping.  He just lays there.

Talley gives a thumbs-up to Maddox, who sits back in awe.
This crazy shit is working --

                     TALLEY
               (to Dennis)
           Now I understand.  That helps.  I can
           make them understand that.

                     DENNIS
           Okay.

                     TALLEY
           Let me come get him.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!

                     TALLEY
           If you won't let me come in, then put him
           outside.

                     DENNIS
           You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out
           the door!

                     TALLEY
           You've already helped yourself once,
           Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his
           life, it'll help when you get to court.

Dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his
deepest fears.  He finally relents --

                     DENNIS
           Fuck you, Talley, fuck you!  You and one
           other guy, but that's it!  I want you
           stripped!  I gotta know you don't have
           guns!

Dennis slams down the phone --

Talley lowers the crisis phone, then looks at Maddox --

                     TALLEY
           Bring up the ambulance.

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

Mobile banks of flood lamps illuminate the front of the
house.  The ambulance waits behind the lights; tactical
officers with M5s and M16s hunker in position in case the
program goes south --

Talley and a paramedic named Bigelow emerge between the
lights, wearing only shorts and shoes.  Bigelow is carrying a
collapsable stretcher --

They stop in the mouth of the drive with a full view of the 
front door.  Talley lifts his cell phone --

                     TALLEY
               (into the phone)
           Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house
           until you've closed the door.

The front door opens, a crack at first, then wider.  The line
of officers behind the lights shifts --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (over his shoulder)
           Easy....

Kevin and Mars waddle out with Walter Smith between them.
They put him down about six feet from the front door, then
return to the house --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (to Bigelow)
           Let's do it.

Talley and Bigelow move forward.  When they reach Walter,
Bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame.  He
peels back Walter's eyelids and flashes a penlight --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           How's he look?

                     BIGELOW
           He's got a concussion for sure.  I'm
           going to brace him.

As Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace, Talley gets the creepy
feeling that he's being watched.  He turns toward the
shutters, and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own.
It's Mars.

Talley stares at Mars, and Mars stares back.  It's as if 
they're locked in a contest of wills until --

                     BIGELOW (CONT'D)
           Let's get him on the stretcher.

Talley turns away to help Bigelow --

                     BIGELOW (CONT'D)
           I'll support his head and shoulders.  You
           lift his hips and knees.  On three.
           Three.

As they carry Walter away, Talley glances back at the eyes.
Mars is still watching him --

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC--TALLEY AND BIGELOW

are surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows
behind the lights.  Another paramedic takes the stretcher
from Talley.  Maddox is waiting with Talley's clothes --

                     MADDOX
           You ready to tell me what's going on?

Talley pulls on his pants --

                     TALLEY
           No.

Talley stalks straight to the ambulance, pulling on his
sweatshirt as he goes --

INT. THE AMBULANCE -- NIGHT

A young physician named Klaus is examining Walter as Talley
steps up into the ambulance --

                     TALLEY 
           I'm the chief of police here.  I have to
           talk to him.

                     KLAUS
           Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal
           pupilation.  He could have an 
           intracranial hematoma or a fracture or
           both.

Talley ignores the doctor and shakes Walter by the face --

                     TALLEY
           Smith!  Wake up!

                     KLAUS
           What are you doing?!  Stop that!

Walter's eyes flutter, one more open than the other.  Talley
leans closer --

                     TALLEY
               (to Smith)
           Wake up, goddamnit.  Who are you?

Klaus tries to shove Talley away, but it's like pushing a
wall --

                     KLAUS
           This man needs a hospital!  Stop it!

Talley grabs Klaus by the arm, trying to make him see --

                     TALLEY
           Use smelling salts, give him a shot, 
           whatever.  I just need a minute.

Bigelow climbs behind the wheel and starts the ambulance.
Talley pounds on the wall, shouting --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Stop the fuckin' engine!

Klaus and Bigelow are both staring at Talley.  Sheriffs and
Talley's own officers have gathered at the open rear of the
ambulance to see what all the shouting is about --

Klaus pointedly looks at Talley's hand gripping his arm.  He
speaks slowly, trying to make Talley understand --

                     KLAUS
           I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even
           know that I can.

                     TALLEY
           Just one question.  Please.

                     KLAUS
           He.  Can't.  Answer.

Talley stares at Walter Smith.  So close.  So damned close.
Walter knows about the disks.  Walter might even know who has
Jane and Amanda.  But now Walter can't talk --

Talley turns away and climbs out of the ambulance --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

As Talley emerges from the van, he pulls Metzger aside --

                     TALLEY
           I want you waiting in Smith's lap.  I
           want to know the second--and I mean the
           second--that he wakes up.

As Metzger hurries after the ambulance, a phone in Talley's
pocket rings.  He's startled and scared; it might be the
Watchman.  Talley takes out the Watchman's white phone, but
it's not ringing.

He answers his other phone --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into phone)
           Talley.

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?

Talley notices that Martin, Maddox, and the others are
staring at him.  He turns away --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           What'd you find out?

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           The cell phone is registered to a jewelry
           store in Beverly Hills.  The phone
           company shows no unusual --

                     TALLEY
               (cutting him off)
           Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the
           Mustang?

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           It was stolen.

Talley lowers the phone in frustration, then --

                     TALLEY
           You get anything on Smith?

                     ANDERS' VOICE
           Chief...it's like none of this exists.
           I'm sorry.

                     TALLEY
           Keep trying.

Talley pockets his phone.  He watches the ambulance pull
away, then strides back through the banks of lights to the
nearest patrol car.  He grabs the dash mike and keys the
public address --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (through the p.a.)
           Call me.  If you're safe, call me.

Talley's voice echoes across the neighborhood.  Every cop in
the cul-de-sac stares at him.  He has addressed the house
for, apparently, no reason.  Dennis shouts from his window --

                     DENNIS
           I'll be safe when I'm outta here, you
           asshole!  I'm not talking any more!

Talley drops the mike without a word and walks away --

INT. GLEN HOWELL'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Howell is on the phone with Ken Seymore, watching the
televised news coverage with increasing alarm --

                     HOWELL
           Was Smith talking?

Intercut Seymore, who is reporting from the York front gate
as the ambulance roars away, siren wailing --

                     SEYMORE
           I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking
           him to the hospital.

                     HOWELL
           Goddamnit, tell me what you know.  Did
           the cops go in?  Did Smith have the
           disks?

                     SEYMORE
           I don't know.  Talley talked those punks
           into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us 
           over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.

                     HOWELL
           What hospital?

                     SEYMORE
           Canyon Country.

Howell slams down the phone.  He breathes deeply, taking a
moment to center himself.  He lifts the phone and punches a
number --

                     HOWELL
           I have another job for you.

EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT

Talley is by himself, pacing at the curb well away from the
other officers.  He is holding his cell phone.  Waiting.

Finally, it rings.  Talley answers, listens, then --

                     TALLEY
           Put him on.

Intercut Thomas, phoning Talley in his room --

                     THOMAS
           Is my daddy okay?

                     TALLEY
           The doctors are taking care of him right
           now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you
           talk?

                     THOMAS
           I think so.

                     TALLEY
           I need your help with something.  But if
           you think those guys could catch you, 
           then I don't want you to do it, okay?

                     THOMAS
           Okay.

                     TALLEY
           I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to
           get hurt.

                     THOMAS
           What do you want me to do?

                     TALLEY
           Your dad has two computer disks.  They
           have funny names:  Marlon and Al.

                     THOMAS
           He has lots of disks.

                     TALLEY
           I think he was working on them today, so
           they're probably in his office.  Could
           you find them and see who they belong to?

                     THOMAS
           Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He
           makes me sit on the floor.

Talley absorbs the bad news like his last best hope of saving
his family is circling the drain --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           But I might be able to sneak into the
           office if they're not around.  Then I
           could open the disks here in my room.

                     TALLEY
           I thought they locked you in your room.

                     THOMAS
           I can get into the crawlspace from my
           closet and climb all over the house.

                     TALLEY
           Can you get into the office?

                     THOMAS
           I can get into the den.  The office is
           right across the hall.

Talley thinks about what the boy is saying, and what he'll
have to do to get Marlon and Al --

                     TALLEY
           If I get Rooney into the back of the
           house, can you find the disks without
           being caught?

                     THOMAS
           Yes, sir.

Talley glances toward the SWAT Command Van as he comes up
with a plan --

EXT. THE COMMAND VAN -- NIGHT

Martin, Maddox, and several of her supervisors are gathered
outside the van as Talley approaches --

Martin sees him coming and steps away to meet him.  She's
pissed off and she wants answers --

                     MARTIN
           I want to know what in hell you're doing.

                     TALLEY
           I'm looking for you.  I need your
           tactical unit.

                     MARTIN
           I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of
           here fast enough, then you take back
           command; you agree to wait on Smith, then
           you risk everything in a stupid stunt to 
           get him out --

                     TALLEY
               (interrupting)
           Don't question me, Captain!  This is my
           crime scene!

                     MARTIN
               (shouting over him)
           -- then when you get him, you damn near
           assault the man in the ambulance!  What
           is going on?

Talley glares at her, half-a-heartbeat from going off, and
then he throttles back --

                     TALLEY
               (simply)
           I'm a negotiator, Captain.  I negotiate.
           That's all you need to know.  Now are you
           going to help me or not?

Martin weighs the determination in his eyes.  She's angry,
she's resentful, and she wants to knock Talley onto his ass--
but, instead, she glances back to her van --

                     MARTIN
           Maddox!  Let's give the man a hand!

INT. SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT

Dennis steps through the double doors that open from the
entry and admires the room--rich paneled walls, soft leather
couches and chairs, and a lush beaten-copper bar.  Walter
Smith's office is directly across the hall.

Dennis saunters behind the bar, letting his fingers play over
the copper, then pours a stiff Ketel One on the rocks.

Kevin appears behind him, watching, as Dennis takes a seat on
one of the leather bar stools, then peels a hundred off a
thick roll and drops it on the bar --

                     DENNIS
               (to an imaginary bartender)
           Keep the change, m'man.

Dennis takes a deep drink of the vodka as Kevin approaches --

                     KEVIN
           We're fucked.

                     DENNIS
           We're fucked until we think of a way out;
           then we're rich.

                     KEVIN
           There is no way out.

                     DENNIS
           For chrissake, please!  Help me
           celebrate!  I figured it out!

                     KEVIN
           Celebrate what?  Going to prison?

Dennis enjoys another stiff belt --

                     DENNIS
           No, dumbass--Talley.  Talley's the guy
           who keeps us in here, and Talley's the
           guy who can let us out.

Dennis grins as if he's discovered the wisdom of the ages --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Cops want to be rich like everyone else.
           All we have to do is share.
               (leans closer and lowers his
                voice)
           And if he wants someone to swing for the
           Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.

                     MARS
           Dennis.

Mars is standing in the doors, large and ominous.  For an
insane moment Dennis thinks that Mars has heard, but then --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           The food's ready.

Dennis grins, then shoves Kevin out of the room ahead of him,
the three of them disappearing toward the kitchen as --

The camera drifts up to an air vent in the ceiling, through
the slats in the grate to --

INT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT

Thomas watches them leave through a hole in the air duct.
When he's confident that they are gone, he continues along
the crawlspace to a service hatch that opens down into --

INT. WINE CELLAR - NIGHT

The "wine cellar" is a climate-controlled closet behind the
bar fitted with floor-to-ceiling wine racks.

The ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas climbs down the racks to
the floor.  He eases open the door and peeks out behind the
bar.  The den is bright with light, and empty --

Thomas lifts his cell phone --

                     THOMAS
               (whispers into the phone)
           It's me, Chief.  I'm in the den.

EXT. SMITHS' REAR WALL -- NIGHT

Talley, Maddox, and several tactical officers are lined along
the rear wall, watching the house.  Talley, with a phone to 
his ear, is looking through a night-vision scope --

He can see into the kitchen through the French doors.  Mars
and Jennifer are inside, and, as we watch, Dennis and Kevin
enter --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Okay, bud, here we go.

Talley hands the scope to Maddox, then keys his radio mike --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into his mike)
           Captain?  Kill the lights.

INT. SMITHS' KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Dennis and Kevin are digging into plates of pizza and eggs
when the house goes dark --

                     DENNIS
           Shit!  It's the cops!

The backyard ERUPTS; explosions from Starflash grenades JUMP
and CAREEN over the swimming pool like New Year fireworks.
It sounds like World War III --

Dennis throws himself behind the kitchen counter --

INT. THE DEN -- NIGHT

The house now dark, Thomas scurries to the double doors.  He
peeks around the corner to see if the coast is clear, then
darts across the hall to --

INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

The office is lit only by the flickering candles.  Thomas
checks his father's computer--no disks.  He searches through
the papers scattered over the desk, but finds nothing --

Then he opens the drawer --

The disk case that his father put there earlier is waiting.
Thomas opens the case --

Marlon.  Al.

He found them.

INT. THE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

The Starflash grenades burn out as Talley's amplified voice
echoes into the house --

                     TALLEY'S VOICE
           It's time to talk face-to-face, Dennis.
           Come out, just you, and we'll talk.

                     KEVIN
           What's he doing?  What's going on?!

                     DENNIS
           Mars!  They're trying to blindside us!
           Check the front!

Mars lurches to his feet and hurries to the office --

INT. THE OFFICE -- NIGHT

Thomas is heading for the door when he hears footsteps coming
fast toward the office --

Thomas reverses course and ducks under the desk.  He pulls
himself into a ball and tries not to breathe --

Mars is in the room.

The desk is a great oak monster, big as a boat.  It sits on
curvy legs that leave a gap between the desk and the floor.
Thomas can see feet --

The feet go to the windows --

                     DENNIS'S VOICE
           What's going on out front?

The feet turn toward the desk.  Thomas tries to squeeze
himself smaller --

                     DENNIS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Mars?!  What the fuck are they doin'?

The feet come to the desk --

                     DENNIS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Mars!  Something's happening!  Get back
           here!

The feet hesitate, then, finally, walk away --

Thomas scrambles from under the desk and darts across the
hall --

EXT. THE BACKYARD -- NIGHT

Talley approaches the house.  He can see flashlights moving
in the kitchen --

                     TALLEY
           Come on, Dennis.  Talk to me.

Dennis doesn't answer, so Talley moves closer.  He spreads
his hands wide --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I'm unarmed.  I'm looking at you.  Get
           out here and let's talk.

Dennis comes to the French doors.  He stuffs his pistol into
his pants, and opens the doors --

                     DENNIS
           You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot
           me?

                     TALLEY
           Only if you try to grab me.  We could've
           shot you from the wall.

Dennis considers that and accepts it.  He steps out of the
house and walks over to Talley --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           You've been in there a long time.
           What're you waiting for?

                     DENNIS
           Would you be in a hurry to go to prison
           for the rest of your life?

                     TALLEY
           I'd be trying to get the best deal that I
           could.

                     DENNIS
           Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach
           in my pocket, show you something?

Dennis Rooney steps closer because he doesn't want anyone
else to see the wad of money he pulls out --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           That's fifty hundred-dollar bills.  Five
           grand.  They got money in this house,
           Talley, more than you've ever seen.

Dennis pushes the money back into his pocket.

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           How much would it be worth to you,
           getting me out of here?

So that's what keeps Dennis in the house--money.  This is the
first that Talley has heard of the money --

                     TALLEY
           You picked a bad house to hole up in,
           son.

                     DENNIS
           Two hundred thousand cash, right in your
           pocket, no one needs to know.

                     TALLEY
           Give up.

                     DENNIS
           There's a million dollars in there, maybe
           two million.  I'll give you half.

Talley stares at Dennis, wondering how much to tell him and
whether or not it will do any good --
  
                     TALLEY
           The man you sent to the hospital is a
           criminal.  He has partners.  This is
           their house and their money and they want
           it back.

These simple facts settle on Dennis like a funeral shroud--
everything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible
sense:  You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.

Dennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness --

                     DENNIS
           It ain't been a good day, Chief.

                     TALLEY
           Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go.
           At least you'll have your life.

Dennis steps inside and pulls the door closed, the darkness
in the house swallowing him like dirty water.

The power is turned on.  The house comes to life --

As Talley turns away, his phone once more rings --

INT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is hunkered with his computer behind his bed so that
the camera can't see him.

                     THOMAS
           I got'm!

Intercut Talley, now back in the cul-de-sac --

                     TALLEY
           Can you open them?

                     THOMAS
           I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's
           taxes.

                     TALLEY
           Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes
           they are?

Thomas scrolls through a spread sheet --

                     THOMAS
           I don't see any people names.  It's all
           businesses.

                     TALLEY
           Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

Thomas changes disks and opens Al --

                     THOMAS
           Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's
           personal tax --

                     TALLEY
           Who is it?

                     THOMAS
           Charles G. Benza.
               (then; noise in the hall)
           They're coming!

Thomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in Talley's
ear.

Talley recognizes the name as easily as an East Coast cop
would recognize John Gotti, and realizes the stunning import
of Smith possessing Sonny Benza's financial records --

                     TALLEY
           Sonny Benza.  Oh, fuck.

Talley sprints across the cul-de-sac to his nearest officer,
Jorgenson, and keys Jorgenson's shoulder mike --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
               (into the mike)
           Leigh?  Metzger, answer me!

                     METZGER'S VOICE
           I'm at the hospital.

                     TALLEY
           Put a guard on Smith!  I want you with
           Smith until I get there!

                     JORGENSON
           What's going on?

                     TALLEY
           Get in the car.  Now.

Talley drops the mike and shoves Jorgenson toward the car --

EXT. CANYON COUNTRY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

Marion Clewes is stepping from his car as Talley's police
unit rips into the parking lot with flashing lights --

Marion watches Talley and Jorgenson rush into the ER, then he
frowns and punches the speed dial on his phone --

                     MARION
               (into his phone)
           We're too late.  The police are here.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Talley and Jorgenson huddle in the hall with Klaus and the ER
supervisor, Dr. Estelle Reese.  Metzger is outside Walter's
room in the background --

                     TALLEY
           I'm posting a guard outside his room, but
           we'll need help from hospital security.

                     REESE
           Is my staff in danger?

                     TALLEY
           Not with my officers here, no, ma'am.

Metzger steps into Walter's room, then reappears --

                     METZGER
           Hey!  He's waking up!

Talley and Klaus press for the room --

INT. WALTER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Walter's eyes flutter open.  His voice is slurred, but
understandable --

                     WALTER
           Where am I?

Klaus peels open Walter's eyes, passing his penlight over
one, then the other --

                     KLAUS
           Canyon Country Hospital.  Do you remember
           your name?

It takes Walter a few moments to answer --

                     WALTER
           Walter Smith.

All of Walter's memories come flooding back, and he tries to
sit up.  Klaus forces him down --

                     WALTER (CONT'D)
           Where are my children?

                     TALLEY
           They're still in the house.

Walter looks at Talley.  He has never seen Talley and has no
idea who he is --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of 
           police.  So far as we know, your children
           are okay.

                     KLAUS
           Chief Talley is the one who got you out.

                     TALLEY
               (to Klaus)
           I need to talk to him.  Alone.

This time, Klaus is hard-pressed to refuse.  He nods, then
steps away --

Talley turns back to Walter Smith, and lowers his voice --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter.  He
           wants the disks, Marlon and Al.  He took
           my family to make me help.

Talley's eyes fill.  His tears drip on the sheets.  Walter
looks away --

                     WALTER
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                     TALLEY
           He's going to kill you.  Don't you know
           that?  He can't take the chance that
           you'll talk.

Klaus returns and places a hand on Talley's shoulder --

                     KLAUS
           That's enough.

                     TALLEY
           Another minute.  Please --

But when he looks back at Walter, he realizes that another
minute will do no good:  Walter's eyes are once more closed.

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot.  He
pounds the hood, cursing, awash in rage and frustration --

And then a phone rings.

Talley takes out the phones.  The white phone is ringing.
The Watchman's phone --

Talley answers furiously, the two of them instantaneously
screaming at each other --

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad!

                     TALLEY
           Do you think I'm going to let you murder
           someone?!

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           You want a blowtorch on your daughter's
           pretty face?!

                     TALLEY
           I'll go in that fuckin' house right now!
           I'll give those disks to the real FBI,
           you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've
           got Smith!  I've got Smith!!

A profound silence fills the parking lot, both men now
purged.  When the Watchman speaks again, his voice is
measured --

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           I guess we each have something the other
           wants.

                     TALLEY
           I guess we do.

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           My people are good to go.  You know who I
           mean?

                     TALLEY
           Your phony FBI assholes.

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your
           shit together.  This isn't L.A.

                     TALLEY
           What do you mean by that?

                     THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE
           You don't want another dead child on your
           conscience.

The line goes dead --

INT. THE SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT

Dennis is pouring another stiff glass of Ketel One --

                     DENNIS
           I shouldn't have told him about the
           money.  Now Talley is gonna keep it for
           himself.

Kevin joins him at the bar.  Mars is by the doors --

                     KEVIN
           He said that?

Dennis downs a big hit of vodka, then moves to the couch --

                     DENNIS
           If we don't escape, we gotta get the word
           out about the cash.  That's how we'll
           stay alive.

                     KEVIN
           What are you talking about?

                     DENNIS
           The only way he can keep the cash is if
           nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap
           all three of us before they even read our
           rights.  He's probably planning it right
           now.

                     KEVIN
           That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.

                     DENNIS
           Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...

Kevin follows his brother to the couch and stares at him;
Dennis has clearly lost his mind, and Kevin has reached the
end of his rope --

                     KEVIN
           It's over.  We have to give up.

                     DENNIS
           Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.

                     KEVIN
           That money's fucked up your brain.
           Talley's going to get tired of waiting
           for us to give up, and we'll all be
           fuckin' killed!

Dennis tips his glass, like a toast --

                     DENNIS
           Then we might as well die rich.

                     KEVIN
           I'm not going to die for this!

Kevin slaps the glass away.  Dennis boils up from the couch.
He grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee
table, Dennis hammering Kevin in a furious rage until he runs
out of gas --

                     DENNIS
           You're my fuckin' anchor, Kevin, the
           fuckin' lead around my life that I've
           been draggin' like a cripple leg!

Dennis gets up and steps back --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Get this into your stupid head, Kevin.
           We're not leaving without the money.

Beaten and whimpering, Kevin crawls away.  Dennis watches him
crawl out of the room, then looks at Mars --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           You got something to say?

                     MARS
           I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going
           to leave.

                     DENNIS
           Fuckin' A.

Dennis returns to the bar.  When he looks around again, Mars
is gone--melted into the darkness.

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer is hiding in her shadows when her doorknob moves.  She
reaches pulls the knife from her shorts, keeping it hidden as
she backs away --

Kevin steps inside, leaving the door ajar --

                     JENNIFER
           What do you want?

                     KEVIN
           Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and
           your brother out of here.

Jennifer now sees the marks and cuts on his face --

                     JENNIFER
           What happened?

                     KEVIN
           Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering
           you a way out of here.

                     JENNIFER
           I can't go without Thomas.

                     KEVIN
           All three of us will go, but we have to
           move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know
           I'm doing this.

                     JENNIFER
           How can we get out?

                     KEVIN
           Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get
           your brother, then come back for you.
           We'll go down the stairs and out the
           front door, you understand?

                     JENNIFER
           Yes.

Kevin goes back to the door, then considers her.  Maybe he
wants to apologize for all this, but the best he can manage
is --

                     KEVIN
           Put on some shoes.

Kevin slips out and pulls the door closed.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

As Kevin emerges from the room, he comes face-to-face with --

Mars.

Mars is a great black shadow in the dark, only inches away.
Kevin steps back --

                     KEVIN
           You scared the shit out of me.  I was
           looking for you.  Dennis wants you to
           watch the monitors.

                     MARS
           I heard you with the girl.

Kevin takes another step back, but Mars follows him, staying
uncomfortably close --

                     KEVIN
           It's over, Mars.  If we stay the cops
           will kill us.  Don't you get that?

Mars seems thoughtful, steps aside --

                     MARS
           I get it.  If you want to go, go.

Kevin expected Mars to stop him, but Mars is letting him go.
Kevin turns away and hurries down the hall --

EXT. YORK ESTATES MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

Talley is returning to the hospital.  As he turns into York
Estates, he's stopped by one of his officers, Dale Cooper.
Talley rolls down his window to see what Cooper wants --

                     COOPER
           Come FBI guys showed up, Chief.  They
           said you were expecting them.

                     TALLEY
           They here now?

                     COOPER
           You'll see'm up the street.

Talley nods, and continues through the gate --

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

Two gray Econoline vans are parked at the curb beneath a
street light, four men in the lead van, two in the rear.

Talley pulls up behind them, then gets out of his car.  He
walks up the middle of the street to the lead van, eyeballing
the men in the vans:  They all have short haircuts and are
wearing black tactical fatigues.  Some of them wear ball caps
that say FBI.

                     THE DRIVER
           You Talley?

                     TALLEY
           Yeah.

The man in the passenger seat, Mr. Jones, gets out.  He looks 
the part of FBI SWAT:  black tac fatigues, jump boots, buzzed
hair.  A pistol hangs under his left arm in a ballistic
holster --

                     MR. JONES
           Let me see some ID.  Something with a
           picture.  I don't give a shit about your
           badge.

Talley takes out his wallet and flashes his photo ID.  Jones
does the same in return --

                     MR. JONES (CONT'D)
           Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special
           Agent Jones.

                     TALLEY
           Are all of you named Jones?

                     MR. JONES
           Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford
           it.

Jones slaps the side of the van.  Doors open, and the
remaining five men climb out.  They strap into vests with FBI
emblazoned on the back, then pass out load-bearing gear, knit
masks, and flash-bang grenades.

                     MR. JONES (CONT'D)
           In a few minutes the white phone is going
           to ring.  So let's get our shit straight
           before that happens.

                     TALLEY
           You used to be a cop.  All of you used to
           be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.

                     MR. JONES
           Don't worry about what we used to be.

                     TALLEY
           How do you people expect this to work?
           The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team
           here.

                     MR. JONES
           What's my name?

                     TALLEY
           What?

                     MR. JONES
           I asked you my name.  You just saw my
           commission slip.  What's my fucking name?

                     TALLEY
           Special Agent Jones.

                     MR. JONES
           Think of me that way and you won't fuck
           up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.

The men at the second van are now passing out MP5s, CAR-15s, 
and loaded magazines --

                     TALLEY
           What are you people going to do?

                     MR. JONES
           You and I are gonna straighten this out
           with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait
           for the man to call.  When he gives the
           word, we move.

                     TALLEY
           What does he have on you?  I know why I'm
           doing this, but what does he have on you?

One of the other men hands an MP5 to Mr. Jones.  Jones
jacks the bolt to chamber a round.  He slings his gun without
answering --

                     MR. JONES
           Let's go, Chief.  Time to get real.

Jones walks away, and all Talley can do is follow --

EXT. MARS KRUPCHEK'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

We're at the end of a gravel road in the low foothills of
Pearblossom, a farm community of fruit orchards in the low
foothills.

A Bristo Camino police car pulls up outside a thirty-foot
Caravan trailer, and Mikkelson and Dreyer get out.  Mikkelson
lights up the trailer with the radio car's spotlight --

                     DREYER
           Krupchek lives in a shithole.

The trailer is dark and silent.  They walk to the door
carrying their Maglites.  Mikkelson tries the knob --

                     MIKKELSON
           I guess we could jimmy it.

                     DREYER
           I don't want to pay for breaking it.

Mikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open.  Both officers
cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at
them --

                     MIKKELSON
           Christ, that stinks.

INT. THE TRAILER -- NIGHT

Mikkelson switches on the lights as they step inside.  Dreyer
sees it first --

                     DREYER
           Mickey?  Look at this shit.

Mikkelson joins Dreyer in the trailer's tiny kitchen where
teetering stacks of folded cereal boxes fill the counters and
sink and floor.  Hundreds and hundreds of Captain Crunch and
Count Chocula boxes, all neatly folded and stacked --

                     DREYER (CONT'D)
           He's burned them.

                     MIKKELSON
           What?

Dreyer shows her a box.  The nose of each character has been
burned with a cigarette --

                     DREYER
           He burned their noses.

                     MIKKELSON
           Okay, this is creeping me out.

Mikkelson opens the oven.  It's empty.  She opens a cupboard.
It's filled with large glass jars.  She opens another 
cupboard.  More jars.  Shapes float in the jars, suspended in
yellow fluid.  Mikkelson and Dreyer examine the shapes --

                     DREYER
           What are those, rats?

Mikkelson opens the fridge, then slams it, looking like she
wants to puke --

                     MIKKELSON
           Ohmigod.  We gotta call Talley.

Dreyer sees the expression on her face, then looks at the
fridge, wondering --

EXT. CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley, Jones, and Jones's phony "FBI" team are moving down
the cul-de-sac toward the house with Martin at their heels --

                     MR. JONES
           Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness
           Protection program.  When Washington
           learned about the situation here, they
           asked Chief Talley for his cooperation.

                     MARTIN
           This is bullshit.  I should've been
           notified.

                     MR. JONES
           I'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's
           after midnight.  Now, if you'll pull your
           people off the perimeter, I want to get
           my people in position.

Martin looks like she wants to spit bullets --

                     TALLEY
           Let it go, Captain.

                     MARTIN
           Goddamned small town bullshit.

Martin relents and stalks away just as Talley's phone rings.

Both Talley and Jones tense at the ring, thinking it might be
the white phone, but it's not --

                     TALLEY
           It's mine.
               (into his phone)
           Talley.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           Chief, it's Mikkelson.

                     TALLEY
           Go, Mickey.

EXT. KRUPCHEK'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

Both Mikkelson and Dreyer are leaning against their car.
They look shellshocked.  Mikkelson is making the call --

                     MIKKELSON
           Chief, we just found Krupchek's trailer.
           We just went in there.

She trails off and looks at Dreyer for help:  How do I say
this?  Dreyer, at a loss, looks away --

                     MIKKELSON (CONT'D)
           He has human body parts in his 
           refrigerator.  He has five human heads.

Mikkelson can't handle it any more.  She lowers the phone --

WITH TALLEY

The shock that Mikkelson is feeling sweeps over Talley as
well.  He takes a moment to get his head around this --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau.
           Don't touch anything, just sit back and
           wait.

                     MIKKELSON'S VOICE
           Yes, sir.

Talley lowers the phone as he stares at the house, wondering
what sort of monster is in there with Thomas and Jennifer.

His gaze shifts to Mr. Jones, who is watching him --

                     TALLEY
           We're getting those kids out of there.

INT. THE SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT

Dennis is sprawled on the couch, sucking the last few drops
of Ketel One from the bottle.  He frowns at the empty bottle,
then lumbers to his feet --

                     DENNIS
               (calling)
           Kev?  Key, Kevin, c'mon back.  I'm sorry
           I hit you.

Dennis weaves through the door, carrying the empty bottle
like his dearest friend --

INT. THE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Dennis staggers into the kitchen --

                     DENNIS
           C'mon, Kev, don't fuckin' pout!  You're
           right.  It's time to call it a game.

                     MARS'S VOICE
           Kevin left.  He didn't want to be here
           anymore.

The voice from the other side of the kitchen startles him.
Mars steps out of the shadows --

                     DENNIS
           You mean he left, as in went out the
           front door?

                     MARS
           I overheard him with the girl.

                     DENNIS
           Shit!  That fuck!  Even when I want to
           turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he 
           take the kids with him?

                     MARS
           I don't know.

                     DENNIS
           Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he
           took those kids, we're fucked!

Mars cross the kitchen and goes for the stairs without
another word --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           KEVIN!!!  You ASSHOLE!!!

Dennis throws the bottle across the room --

INT. THE HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is scared by all the shouting, but he waits in the
darkness until Dennis quiets, and then we notice that he is
no longer in his room; he's in the hobby room, once more
trying to reach the gun --

Thomas stacks two phone books on the bench, then uses the
phone books as an extra step to reach the high shelf --

He can finally reach the gun case!  He puts it on the bench,
then climbs down, and opens the case.  Thomas is bouyant with
confidence; now, he can protect himself and his sister!

Thomas shoves the gun into his pants and creeps back into --

INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when his foot
slips and he bangs his head --

It's so dark in ehre that Thomas can't see what made him 
slip, but he tests the floor.  His shoe makes a tacky sound.

Thomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before, and
turns it on.  A dark liquid like oil is spreading on the
floor.

Thomas follows it with his light to the broom closet.  He
lets out more light and sees that the oil is red.

Thomas knows that something terrible is behind the door, but
he is drawn to it.  He reaches out --

Kevin's lifeless body topples out, collapsing in a heap at
Thomas's feet.  His neck is cut so deeply that his head is
almost severed --

His eyes are open.

Thomas screams!

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer is anxiously waiting for Kevin.  When she hears
someone in the hall, she thinks that it's Kevin, but when the
door opens --

It's Mars.

He steps inside, tall, wide, and massive as a bear.  He's
carrying the claw hammer.  Jennifer backs away --

                     MARS
           Kevin left without you.

                     JENNIFER
           I don't know what you're talking about.

Mars turns off the lights.

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Don't do that.  Turn on the lights.

Jennifer grows even more frightened.  Mars follows her across
the room until she backs into the window --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's
           coming back!

                     MARS
           Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, 
           everybody's gone.

When Mars reaches her, he touches the hammer to the chest,
pressing to make it hurt --

                     MARS (CONT'D)
           Now we can do whatever we want.

                     JENNIFER 
           Stop it.

Mars rakes the claws slowly between her breasts as Jennifer
finds the knife in her shorts.  She jerks free the blade and
stabs blindly burying the knife high in his chest, but Mars
doesn't even step back --

He grips the handle, moaning hideously as he pulls out the
knife.  A red flower blossoms from the wound.

Jennifer tries to get past him, but he grabs her throat and
pins her to the wall --

                     MARS
           You're going to enjoy this.

He raises the knife to her face --

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

The scream from the laundry room having scared the shit out
of Dennis, he has his gun out --

                     DENNIS
           Who's that?  Goddamnit, who's there?

Dennis turns on his flashlight and sweeps the beam across the
kitchen --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Kev?  Is that you?  Talley?

Dennis weaves across the kitchen, pushing the gun ahead of
him --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           Kevin, if that's you, say something.
           Mars said you left.

Dennis steps through the door into --

INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

Dennis shines the light on the floor and sees the red ooze.
He follows the blood to Kevin's body, but even then doesn't
realize what he's seeing --

                     DENNIS
           Kevin, what the fuck?  Get up.

Dennis steps closer, and now he sees the open neck, the
grotesque white bone within the flesh --

Only one other person in the house could have done this --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           MARS?!?!

Dennis hears Jennifer screaming upstairs --

                     DENNIS (CONT'D)
           MARS!!!

Dennis rushes from the room --

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Dennis slams through the door so heard that the door crashes
into the wall.  Mars is across the room, still holding
Jennifer by the neck --

Dennis aims his gun --

                     DENNIS
           You're dead, you fuck.

Mars calmly pulls the girl in front of him, blocking Dennis's
aim.

                     MARS
           What's wrong, Dennis?  Why're you so
           pissed off?

It's weird the way Mars is acting, so calm and all.  But
Dennis can see the feat in Jennifer's face and her swollen
eyes.  She manages one word --

                     JENNIFER
           Please...

Dennis tries to aim past her --

                     DENNIS
           This fuck killed Kevin.  There's blood
           everywhere down there --

Jennifer sobs.  And when she does --

Mars charges across the room holding Jennifer like a shield.
Dennis hesitates only a heartbeat, and then it's too late --

Jennifer crashes into him, the full force of Mars's weight
behind her, knocking Dennis backward into the hall --

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

They fall through the door into a tangle on the floor.  Mars
raises the hammer, then brings it down, smashing Dennis over
and over --

INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Thomas emerges from the closet to see the carnage in the
hall:  Mars over Dennis, grunting like a pig as he turns
Dennis into pulp, and Jennifer crawling away, splattered with
blood --

Thomas pulls the gun from his pants and darts past Mars into
the hall --

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Thomas grabs Jennifer's arm and pulls her toward the stairs --

                     THOMAS
           C'mon, Jen!  Run!

Mars heaves to his feet and turns after them --

Thomas jerks up the pistol with both hands --

                     THOMAS (CONT'D)
           I'll shoot you!

Mars stops, blood dripping from his face and hands and the
hammer.  Jennifer pulls her brother --

                     JENNIFER
           Keep going!

They back toward the stairs, Thomas trying to hold the gun
steady.  Mars follows, spreading his arms wide as if to
embrace them --

                     MARS
           Everyone's gone.  We can do whatever we
           want.  We can do anything.

                     THOMAS
           I'll shoot you!  I'm not kidding, you
           better stay away!

Mars keeps coming --

Thomas pulls the trigger.  Click.

Mars stops, frozen by the sharp sound --

Thomas pulls again.  Click click click --

No bullets.

                     JENNIFER
           Run!!!!!

Thomas and Jennifer sprint for the stairs --

INT. FRONT ENTRY -- NIGHT

Jennifer and Thomas crash down the stairs and spill into the
entry.  Thomas goes to the front door but Jennifer pulls him
away --

                     JENNIFER
           No!  They have everything nailed!

They race away down the hall just as Mars reaches the bottom
of the stairs --

INT. THE SMITHS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Mars is closing.  Jennifer and Thomas scramble through the
bedroom only paces ahead of him.  They run straight into --

INT. THE SAFE ROOM -- NIGHT

Jennifer and Thomas slam the door and throw the bolts just as
Mars crashes into the door --

Jennifer and Thomas have made it.  They are shaking and
scared, but they are safe.

                     JENNIFER
           He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.

                     THOMAS
           I know.

Mars pounds on the door with the hammer.  They can see him on
the monitors.  Slow rhythmic pounding.  Then he walks away --

                     JENNIFER
           What's he doing?

They can see him on the monitors--moving through the hall,
going into the entry....

Mars picks up a bucket of gasoline.  He splashes gas on the
walls and floor all the way back to the bedroom, and then he
empties the bucket on the security room's door --

Mars looks up at the camera again and takes out a match.  He
flicks it with his thumbnail and it flares --

                     JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           Ohmigod, he's going to burn us!

Mars tosses the match, and the room erupts into flame --

EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT

Talley is arguing with Jones, trying to convince the man that
they need to move into the house now --

                     TALLEY
           We've got to get those kids out of there!

                     MR. JONES
           Not until the man calls.

                     TALLEY
           Those kids are in there with a fucking
           psychopath!  He kills people!

                     MR. JONES
           They've been in there all day.

Talley's phone rings.  Again, they both think that it's the
white phone, but instead it's Talley's personal phone --

                     TALLEY
               (into his phone)
           Talley.

It's Thomas.  His voice cuts in and out, broken by static --

                     THOMAS'S VOICE
           Mars killed Kevin and Dennis!  We're in
           the security room.  He's burning the
           house --

Thomas' phone cuts out.  Talley turns toward the house and
sees a growing column of smoke.  He looks back at Jones --

                     TALLEY
           You do what you have to do; I'm getting
           those kids.

Talley hurries away.  Jones stares after him, then comes to
his own agonized decision.  He catches up --

                     MR. JONES
           Talley!  We'll secure the house, but then
           we get the disks.

Talley accepts that; they move toward the house --

EXT. THE SMITHS' HOUSE -- NIGHT

The banks of floodlights abruptly shut off, plunging the
house and grounds into darkness --

INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The fire is spreading, following the gasoline trail through
the hall and the rest of the house; a thick layer of smoke 
covers the ceiling --

Mars sees that the outside lights have been turned off, and
senses that the cops are making their move.  That's all right
with Mars--he's been waiting to die for most of his life --

Mars checks the load in his pistol, then melts away into the
dark --

A moment later, throbbing music pounds the house --

EXT. SMITHS' HOUSE -- NIGHT

Talley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the
house.  Both are carrying fire extinguishers.  They peer
inside, then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window --

INT. FRONT GUEST ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley enters first, followed by Jones.  The air is thick
with smoke, and the music is confusing; the hall outside the
room is filled with flames --

Talley points toward the bedroom, then uses hand signals to
countdown the launch--three...two...one --

Jones keys his throat mike to launch the strike --

                     MR. JONES
           Go --

They blast the flames with their fire extinguishers, then
plunge into the hall --

INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The sliding glass doors shatter as one of Jones's men
breaches the door.  As he rolls to his feet, Mars shoots him
from the flames --

A second man rolls through the door, and Mars shoots again,
laughing as the man writhes in flames --

INT. HALL -- TALLEY AND JONES

fight back the flames with their fire extinguishers, working
their way into --

INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

It's an inferno as Talley and Jones come through the door.
They spot the two men on the floor just as --

Mars rears up behind the flames.  He is shirtless and 
glistening, screaming maniacally is he fires his gun --

Talley and Jones fire in unison, pounding Mars with bullets
and knocking him into the fire.  Mars thrashes and screams,
burning alive --

Talley hears pounding inside the safe room:  Jennifer and
Thomas!  He fights his way to the security door, which is
covered with flames --

                     TALLEY
           The kids are in here!

                     MR. JONES
           Where's the office?

                     TALLEY
           Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks
           later!

Talley expects that Jones will help, but Jones is aiming his
gun --

                     MR. JONES
           We don't need you any more, Chief.  We
           can get the disks on our own.

But before Jones can kill Talley, Mars heaves himself up from
the flames, firing wildly.  He hits Jones in the head --

Talley fires reflexively, his powerful .45 kicking Mars
across the room and out the glass doors.  Talley turns back
to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire
extinguisher --

                     TALLEY
           Thomas!  Thomas, it's me!

Thomas and Jennifer jerk open the door, but shrink from the
heat.  Talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher, then
pulls them into his arms --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Stay close.  We're going to move fast --

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Talley shepherds Jennifer and Thomas past the flames --

INT. THE ENTRY -- NIGHT

They reach the entry, and Talley uses his pry bar to break
open the door --

A wall of cops are out on the street, waiting --

                     TALLEY
               (to Thomas)
           Are the disks still in your room?

                     THOMAS
           No!  They're right here --

Thomas pulls Marlon and Al from his pocket --

Talley clutches the disks and pulls the boy close in a
spontaneous hug.  They run out the door as we --

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. WALTER SMITH'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Walter is resting comfortably when Talley steps up beside his
bed.  Talley is a mess--smokey, dirty, greased with sweat --

                     TALLEY
               (quietly)
           Smith.

Walter opens his eyes, then Talley steps away.  Jennifer and
Thomas are standing behind him.  They rush to their father --

                     JENNIFER/THOMAS
           Daddy!

                     WALTER
           Thank God!  Are you guys all right?
           You're not hurt?

                     THOMAS
           Our house is on fire!  We almost burned!

Both children burst into tears, and Walter hugs them.  He
looks up at Talley, then gently eases his kids away --

                     WALTER
               (to Jennifer and Thomas)
           You guys step out for a second.  I have
           to talk to the Chief.

Walter waits until his children are gone, and then --

                     WALTER (CONT'D)
           Did you find the disks?

                     TALLEY
           Yes.

                     WALTER
           Then you have everything.  You can put
           them away.

                     TALLEY
               (touches his wrist)
           A man has my family.  Gold watch here.
           Dark tan.

                     WALTER
           That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his
           way for the disks.

                     TALLEY
           How do I reach him?

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Talley is alone in his car, his phone to his ear, listening
to the ring at the other end of the line.  A familiar voice
answers --

                     HOWELL'S VOICE
           Hello?

                     TALLEY
           Two words:  Glen Howell.

Intercut Howell in his motel room.  He is thrown by getting
this call --

                     HOWELL
           How did you get this number?

                     TALLEY
           Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his
           men.  The other three are in jail.  I
           have the disks.  I have Walter Smith.
           And you know what, you motherfucker?  I
           have you.

                     HOWELL
           I have your fucking family.  Don't forget
           that.

                     TALLEY
           I also have a couple of million in cash.
           Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.

This throws Howell, too.  He didn't expect anything like
this; not from Talley --

                     HOWELL
           What do you want?

                     TALLEY
           My wife and my daughter and the money.
           I'll bring the disks to the mall by the
           freeway, you bring my family.  We'll
           trade.

                     HOWELL
           Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!

                     TALLEY
           I think you got no choice.

Howell thinks about it.  It's a tough call because Talley
might be setting him up, but they're playing even hands--
Talley still has the disks --

                     HOWELL
           Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on
           the road west of town?

                     TALLEY
           Yeah.

                     HOWELL
           You got ten minutes.  If you're one
           minute late, we won't be here to find.

Talley tosses his phone aside, then drives away --

EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT

A graphic identifies our location:  New York City.

INT. VICTOR CASTELLANO'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT

Victor Castellano is "the old man" that Benza's people have
mentioned.  He is not a happy man in the best of
circumstances and is even less happy now --

Castellano's assistant, Jamie Beldone, is briefing him on
events in the West --

                     BELDONE
           The house is in flames, Benza's
           accountant is with the cops, and they're
           stacking the bodies like cordwood.

                     CASTELLANO
           Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.

                     BELDONE
           You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I
           would've moved in when we first found
           out.

Castellano scowls at the younger man --

                     CASTELLANO
           And by doing so, he would've known we
           have spies in his organization.

                     BELDONE
               (embarrassed)
           Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If
           the cops end up with the disks, we're
           gonna see a whole lot of heat.

                     CASTELLANO
           I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I
           hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too.
           Always with the tan.

                     BELDONE
           What do you want to do?

                     CASTELLANO
           Our people out there, they good people?
           People in the right place?

                     BELDONE
           The best.

                     CASTELLANO
           Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off,
           fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end
           up with those disks, we cut our losses.

                     BELDONE
           I understand.

                     CASTELLANO
           I want a message sent:  No fuckups
           allowed.

                     BELDONE
           I'll make the call.

Vic Castellano watches Beldone depart as he considers what is
about to come --

EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT

The motel floats like an island of light in the middle of
nowhere.  A few cars are scattered throughout the quiet 
parking lot --

MIKE RUIZ

is hiding in weeds across from the motel, keeping an eye on
the road for Talley's approaching vehicle.  A radio
transmission crackles quietly --

                     MANELLI'S VOICE
           You see anything?

Ruiz keys the mike --

                     RUIZ
           Not yet.

Talley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to Mike
Ruiz's ear --

LOU BUSTER

Buster is on the dark side of thge parking lot, standing watch
outside the pool of light in the shadows --

Gravel crunches behind him; Buster turns, and --

Talley cracks him across the face with his .45 --

WITH TALLEY

He edges along the perimeter of the parking lot, working as
close as he can to a Fat Man who is leaning against the green
Mustang --

The door to a ground floor room opens, and Glen Howell steps
out.  Talley recognizes Howell from the big gold watch --

                     HOWELL
               (to the Fat Man)
           Keep your eyes open.  He should've been
           here.

Howell returns to the room.  The Fat Man steps away from the
Mustang, and --

Talley slams into his blindside, using the .45 as a club.
The Fat Man staggers, and Talley wraps an arm around his neck
in a choke hold, running him at the door --

Talley rams the Fat man into the door, knocking it open and
shoving the Fat Man through --

INT. HOWELL'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Talley explodes through the door with the Fat Man in front of
him like a shield --

                     TALLEY
               (screaming)
           Police!

Glen Howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed.
Duane Manelli rolls out of a chair, aiming from the floor in
a two-handed grip --

                     HOWELL
           Don't shoot!  Don't shoot him!

Talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men.  He
has his back to the wall and the Fat Man in front of him --

                     TALLEY
           Where's my family?!  Where's my family,
           you fuck?!

All three men are sucking air like freight engines.  No
one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire.
Everybody has something the other guy wants.  That's the only
thing holding them back --

                     HOWELL
           Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're
           here to do business.

                     TALLEY
           You said they would be here, goddamnit!
           Where are they?

Howell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free
on his finger.  He's trying to cool Talley --

                     HOWELL
           They're close.  Let me make a call.  You
           can see they're okay.

                     TALLEY
           You said they would be here!

Howell takes out his phone and presses a number.  Talley
shifts his aim from Howell to the Fat Man to Manelli --

                     HOWELL
               (into the phone)
           Put on the woman.

Howell offers the phone, but Talley is wary--he can't let go
of the Fat Man and he won't put down his pistol.  Howell
carefully holds the phone to Talley's ear --

                     TALLEY
               (into the phone)
           Jane?

                     JANE'S VOICE
           Jeff, we're --

Howell backs away with the phone --

                     HOWELL
           You have the disks?

Talley takes out a single disk.  It's the one labeled
'Marlon.'  He tosses it onto the bed --

                     TALLEY
           You get the other one when I have my
           girls.  Not talk to them; have them.

                     HOWELL
           Where is it?

                     TALLEY
           Close.

Howell considers the disk.  If Talley has the second disk in
his pocket, Howell could just shoot him.  But Howell can't be
sure --

                     HOWELL
           I have to see if it's real.

Howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the 
corner.  He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read.  He's
satisfied with what he sees --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
           All right.  Now the second one.

                     TALLEY
           First my girls.  I get my girls, you get
           the other disk.

Howell stares at Talley again, then picks up his phone --

                     HOWELL
               (into the phone)
           Bring them.  Stop the car outside the
           room, but don't get out.

The car pulls up directly outside the door.  It was only
seconds away.  Marion Clewes is driving; Jane and Amanda are
wedged into the front seat beside him, Jane next to Marion,
Amanda on the far side.  They are bound tight with their
mouths taped, immobile and helpless, their eyes wide with
fear --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
               (into his phone)
           Aim your gun at the woman's head.  If he
           doesn't give me the disk, kill her.

Marion presses a gun to Jane's temple --

Talley jerks his gun toward Howell --

                     TALLEY
           I'll kill you!  You won't get the other
           disk!

                     HOWELL
           If you shoot me, he'll kill your
           daughter.  Do you want to lose both of
           them?

Talley aims at the man in the car; he aims at Howell.  He
tried so hard to save his family, and now Howell has him
boxed --

                     HOWELL (CONT'D)
           The negotiation is over, Talley.  I won.
           Now give me the disk or he'll put her
           brain on the glass.

Talley looks at Jane and Amanda, and his eyes fill.  He
mouths the words --

                     TALLEY
           I love you.

He's saying good-bye.

Talley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man, who stumbles
away.  Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed.  Manelli
scoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the
door --

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and
           they're giving it to the real FBI.  This
           one's a fake.

                     HOWELL
           You'd better be kidding.

Howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top --

                     TALLEY
           I'm a cop, you asshole!  What did you
           expect me to do?  Pretend all this never
           happened?

Howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man
reading his own death sentence.  There is nothing on this
disk.

                     TALLEY (CONT'D)
           Benza's over.  You're over.  I just want
           to take my family home.

Howell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous --

                     HOWELL
           Are you out of your mind?

                     MARION
               (quietly)
           You fucked up, Glen.

Howell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time, and
gives him the order --

                     HOWELL
           Kill them.

Marion aims his gun directly between Talley's eyes, then
points it at Howell --

                     MARION
           No fuckups allowed.

Marion shoots Howell in the head, then the Fat Man, then
Manelli--bambambam--one shot, one kill.

He lowers his gun, considers Talley.  Talley doesn't
move.

                     MARION (CONT'D)
           It's like a storm, isn't it?  This raging
           force that you can't control does
           whatever it wants, and the best you can
           do is survive.  A winner survives.

                     TALLEY
           Why...?

The question being:  Why aren't I dead?  Why aren't you
killing me?

                     MARION
           What good would it do to kill you?  The
           police already have the disk.

Marion considers Talley another moment --

                     MARION (CONT'D)
           Your wife is a very nice lady.

Marion goes to his car.  He helps out Jane and Amanda, then
gets into his car and drives away.

EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- SUNRISE

Talley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family.  He
scoops up Jane and Amanda, hugging them tightly as the camera 
pulls up and away, rising, leaving this reunited family as
Marion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead --

CLOSING CREDITS

The credits roll to black, then--

EXT. SONNY BENZA'S HOME -- DAWN

The garage door slides up.  Benza backs out in his Mercedes,
then roars to the front door.  He pops the trunk, then gets
out and hurries to the front door.  He sticks his head inside
and calls to his wife --

                     BENZA
           The fucking jet's waiting!  Would you get
           your shit out here?!

He picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to
the car --

AT THE TRUNK

Benza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags.
When he steps back around again, a nondescript sedan is
waiting in the drive --

                     A VOICE
           No fuckups allowed.

Gunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above Palm Springs.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
               Leonardo, che pazzo.

     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...

     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE

     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
     glasses with his trademark beard.

     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
     syncrasies.

     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
     laser show.

                             DA VINCI
                       (silencing authority)
               Basta vapore.

     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace
     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
     ward with tongs.

     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS

     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.

     The tongs enter the frame.

     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar.

                             APPRENTICE TWO
               Maestro, che meraviglia!

                             APPRENTICE THREE
               Lei e' proprio fantastico!

     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

                             DA VINCI
               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

                             DA VINCI
               L'ho fatto.

     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other.

     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies.

     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water.

     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE

     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
     the Vinci vista.

     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:

     A HAWK

     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.

     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL

     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over
     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out
     of an eye-closed trance.

     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson
     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that
     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.

     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY

     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG
     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking
     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.

                             WISE GUARD
               We're losing our biggest celebrity
               today.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               You're kidding, Petey the Paint
               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

                             WISE GUARD
               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.
               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the
               great cat burglars.

     INT. PRISON CELL WALL

     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and
     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     THE BLOCK

     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.

                             WISE GUARD
               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.
               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You
               know, Crime used to have a little
               class.  A hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             HAWK
               Remind me to fire my publicist.

     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               Darn, these are for L-block...

     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter
     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     UNLOCK the door.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               - go back down to security and-

     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The
     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch
     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from Hawk.

                             WISE GUARD
               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             HAWK
               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             HAWK
               Oh, give this back to Petey in A
               block.  Tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but I think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               The Paint Thinner Killer did
               this?  I think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             WISE GUARD
               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             HAWK
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               You got it.  A double.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY

     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and
     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             ANTONY
               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               We've got a proposition...

                              HAWK
               Answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
               how's the "Family?"  Kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              CESAR
               How many times do I have to say
               it?  I didn't put the hit on
               Little Eddie... Never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  I
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             HAWK
               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               That's your mark, man.  What did
               Little Eddie ever do to...

     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
     on the hood.

                             CESAR
               You're hitting Rutherford's
               Auction House.  Easy as my
               brother's wife.  Directions are
               in the bag.  Just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             HAWK
               Or you cut off my thingie.
               Directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             ANTONY
                       (defensively)
               Yeah, directions even I could
               understand.

     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             CESAR
               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware Store and sell
               spatulas...

                             HAWK
               If the Mario brothers weren't
               Jersey's third largest family,
               I'd say kiss my ass.  But
               considering your status, I'll
               say slurp my butt.

     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     Cesar's hands.

                             CESAR
               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

                             HAWK
               Baseball, why?

     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
     "Baseball."  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs
     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             HAWK
               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
     Hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             HAWK
               Help?  Police?

     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             CESAR
                       (unfazed)
               You need some time to think.
               That's cool, but next time, I'm
               not going to say "Please."

     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.
     Hawk seethes...

                             HAWK
               I don't believe this.  I've been
               out forty seconds...

     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to
     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             ALEX
               That's the first thing I did.
               Smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss
               anything?

                             HAWK
                       (getting up)
               Your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  Good to see you,
               Alex, been having a lousy day.

                             ALEX
               Lousy day?  The man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  What, you missing out
               on the Cell Block Water Ballet
               pageant?  Believe me, it's
               overrated.

     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

                             ALEX
               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this
               time, I promise.

     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             HAWK
               Looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             ALEX
               Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             HAWK
               My next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  Swear to God...
               tubby.

     EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

     The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
     Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             HAWK
               That's your definition of "Hard?"

                             ALEX
               Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come
               Fly with Me."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             ALEX
               Still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               I'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              HAWK
               Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--I'm going to take
               it so straight that I won't tape
               a Mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the National
               Baseball League.

                             ALEX
               Now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  Statue of
               Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?
               Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some
               women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some
               chicks?

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, let's just get to
               Alex's.  Your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               God, I'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  What the hell's a
               Nintendo?

                             ALEX
               Oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine European coffees?
               Who's your buddy?

     Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             HAWK
               The man knows, the man knows!

     Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             ALEX
               So Mr. Coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want
               me to do a job.

     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             ALEX
               Those dago-guinea-I can say
               this shit I'm Italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             HAWK
               Ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  Just get me to the bar...
               It's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....

     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.
     Sinatra cuts off.

     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             ALEX
               I didn't know how to tell you.  A
               couple brokers stopped in for
               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next
               thing I know Fast Track Digest
               votes us "Watering Hole of the
               Month."  Now, I'm shopping for
               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                             HAWK
               I read about these people in
               Newsweek.  Where's all the
               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the
               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's
               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain
               Bob's steering wheel?

                             ALEX
               Hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                             HAWK
               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat
               cheese?  I admit, I've been known
               to go wild and order a Canadian
               Bacon in my time, but..

     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
     immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Can you read.... smoker?

                             HAWK
               Can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
                       (Huh?)
               No.

                              HAWK
               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You
               know, I thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a V.C.R.
               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's
               why I became a serial arsonist.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke
               all you want.  Have mine....

     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

                             GATES (O.S.)
               You're under arrest...

     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             GATES
               Have a seat.  Good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             HAWK
               The pleasure's all yours, Officer
               Gates.

     BACK OF THE BAR

     With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table.

     GATES' TABLE

     Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  Gates eats around it.

                             GATES
               Why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               Especially after I got you such
               a nice job.

                             HAWK
               What job?

     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             GATES
               The auction house, asshole.  One
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  No
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               It's a great deal, I can't lie.

                             HAWK
               The only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  I know I was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  You know,
               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,
               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are
     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.

                             GATES
               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  I did dog and pony for
               you!  You think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the Three Stooges...

                             HAWK
               How was I supposed to know they
               were women?  Besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "Soitinly."

     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             GATES
               Remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             HAWK
               Yes.

                             GATES
               Remember that shoe you lost...

                             HAWK
               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             GATES
               One phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     Hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             HAWK
               What else do you got under there
               ... I don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             GATES
               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,
               but I can make it stick because
               I'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     Alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             ALEX
               How is everything tonight, sir?

                             GATES
               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

                             HAWK
               Alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             ALEX
               Sure.  That's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated Chuck
               Wagon.

                             GATES
                       (mouthful)
               You're full of shit.

     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             ALEX
               No, man, actually you are.  Just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets
     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.

     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN

     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,
     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's
     "Witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             ALEX
               Hmmmm.....

                             HAWK
               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk
     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             HAWK
               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
               Remember when the Captain.....

                             ALEX
               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it
     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.
     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             HAWK
               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last
               time I played the game, Simpson
               only had a 40.

                             ALEX
               Just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  You re
               still the best, I know it.

                             HAWK
               But you got three guards who...
               Shit, what am I doing?  Where's
               the want ads?  Gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             ALEX
               Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               This isn't funny.  I'm not into
               this.  I...

                             ALEX
               There goes five seconds...My
               record's eighteen.

                             HAWK
               You're not...LISTENING!

     Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             HAWK
               I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
               Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford
               Auction House.  By the way, how
               many seconds?

                             ALEX
               Rutherford Auction... that name...

     Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             HAWK
               Alex!

                             ALEX
               Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have
               to change them.  "Witchcraft."
               What's the running time?

     Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             HAWK
               3:48.  I can't get you involved,
               man.  This is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               God, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  Haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     Alex.

                             ALEX
               I'm in.  Have you seen the public
               service announcements for Diabetes.
               We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  I
               got a plan.  You won't have to hail
               Cesar or Gates.

     Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate.

                             HAWK
               I'm a bum.

     EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT

     TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
     They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."  IMPECCABLY
     DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.

     Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away...

     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
     that connects the Auction House with another Building.

     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
     beneath.

     AT THE WINDOW

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             ALEX
               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
               I'm wearing my girdle.

     INT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT

     Hawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk
     immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper-
     ing...

                             HAWK
               Cameras?

                             ALEX
               No need.  Guards' station's right
               there.

     Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a
     grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

     Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards'
     Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and
     Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

     INT. THE GUARDS' STATION

     Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke.
     Wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into...

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button
     flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them,
     sharing a cig.

                             ALEX
               They record everything their
               video surveillance takes in...

                             HAWK
               Yes, master-thief, I can see that.
               You said something about a plan...

     Alex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

                             ALEX
               Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.
               A little rewind and re-wire action
               and the Guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode.

     Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY.

     INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of
     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo Floor Washer.

     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
     and snooze.

     INT. GUARDS' STATION

     The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Check out Big Stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               Big Stan!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     THE FIRST FLOOR

     The laughing security guards see the crunch.

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R.

                             ALEX
               You got about five minutes and
               change.

                             HAWK
               5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

                             ALEX
               You know they invented something
               while you were inside.  Called a
               watch.

     A freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music
     of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               "A mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             ALEX
               "He kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     Hawk isn't.

     INT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     POWER ROOM

     Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large
     Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     The lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console
     screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Hell-o.  Check the Power room,
               bud...

     Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position...

     POWER ROOM

     Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the V.C.R.S.
     They now all have their PLAY buttons lit up.

                             ALEX
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     Alex.

     INSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     The singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the
     Guards' Station.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather be a fish?"

     He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  Hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             BIG STAN
                       (moving back off)
               Very funny.

     The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  And the Blue Chair.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM--CAMERA P.O.V.

     From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  But no Blue chair.

     HAWK

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             HAWK
                       (lyric trouble)
               "A fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               "He can't write his name or read
               a book.  To fool people is his
               only thought."

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

                             HAWK
                       (remembering)
               "And though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins
     the dial.  The CLICKS from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  Then there's a CLUNK.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
     a cup of coffee.  He doesn't swallow.

     His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh
     screen.  He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the
               seventh floor and I don't know
               how to say this, I see the Blue
               Chair.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               What the... You think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     Screen Two shows THE TWO SECURITY GUARDS THEMSELVES
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Somebody rewired the recorders!

     AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's
     worktable.

     Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             HAWK
               "And all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             ALEX (V.O.)
               "Every day you meet quite a few."

     Alex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "So you see it's all up to you.
               You can be better than you are.
               You could be swinging on a star."

     THE AUCTION ROOM

     BIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Shit, let's roll!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             ALEX
               The song's over!  Come on!
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               What am I doing here?  There are
               so many things I wanna do that
               aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.
               Kiss a woman in Italy.

                             ALEX
                       (more frantically)
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               Paint a woman in a lighthou--I
               don't want to steal a horse.
               Life is...

     Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and
     Two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             ALEX
                       (DEADPAN)
               "You could be swinging on a star."
               You couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

     Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the Guards into a bellyflop.

     Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             HAWK
               Let's go down the freight elevator.

     Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               Keep those ideas coming.

     Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.

     INT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE

     Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing.

                             ALEX
               I'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that Guard am I.

     Big Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               I got a bad feeling....

                             HAWK
               I can't even swim.

                             ALEX
               Hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     Big Stan raises his gun.

     Hawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the
     building....

     Closer and closer to the awning....

     The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls......

                                                CUT TO:

     RIGHT INTO A LAZ-Y-BOY CHAIR

     Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  The foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  A HAND pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.

     INT. GATES APARTMENT--LATE NIGHT

     Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat.)
     A sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs
     Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag.

     Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a-KEEP ON
     TRUCKIN'-T-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             GATES
               Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  How about a Gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               I used real hot dogs.

                             HAWK
               Weren't you the bartender at
               Jonestown?

     Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful
     Gatesirita sip.

                             CESAR
               Good job, not pretty, but good.

                             HAWK
               Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know
               how to party or what?

     Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             GATES
               All this trouble for a horsey.
               I may not know art, but I know
               what I like.

                             HAWK
                       (to Dog picture)
               You certainly do.

                             GATES
               So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-
               Buckingham-Palace-looking-
               Butlerhead getting here?

                             ALFRED
               Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

     A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
     distaste.  He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
     FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
     HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.
     Hawk notices this.

                             GATES
               Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

                             ALFRED
               I'll pass.  May I?

     Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             ALFRED
               Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo
               Da Vinci's last commission for the
               Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

                             GATES
               Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious
               for you.  Now where's my cut?

     With dignity, Alfred SMASHES the ancient horse over
     Gates's head.  Alfred rummages through the debris
     REVEALING a perversely labyrinthine CRYSTAL PIECE.
     (recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop).

                             GATES
               You son-of-a......I don't believe
               this!  You come into my house!

     Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             GATES
               I ought to take Big Ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     A blade slides down Alfred's arm.  Half-yawning, he...

     ALFRED'S 180 DEGREE POV

     spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him.
     THE BLADE goes back up Alfred's arm.

     The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  Gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             GATES
               Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

     Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  Gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  The Dog
     Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             ALFRED
               So much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               Excuse my dry British humor.

                             CESAR
                       (rising)
               Lovely work, Alfred, taking the
               Concorde back?

                             ALFRED
               Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             HAWK
               I hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             ANTONY
               You know, I think Gates promised
               Hawk a cut, too....

     The Mario brothers cackle out.  Hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             ALFRED
               Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

                             HAWK
                       (breathless)
               Too-do-loo, babe.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN

     Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             ALEX
               Did I miss anything?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
         
                             ALEX
               Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             HAWK
               The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross
               between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.
               Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied
               dumptied it over Gates's head.  He
               said it was made by, get this,
               Leonardo..

                             ALEX
                       (professorial)
               Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
               Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               I consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  Horse things.

     The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             HAWK
               Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                             ALEX
                       (holding up newspaper)
               Morning edition.  Seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             HAWK
               "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but I do have my
               pride.  Face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, I....

     Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the
     Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
     and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

                             ALEX
               Why try?

                             HAWK
                       (hurdling the bar)
               Because I'm tired of not
               understanding things.  Cops,
               Mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out I really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               You re not thinking of going to...

                             HAWK
               Alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  Where's your tux?

     INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

     Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk
     enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
     all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
     items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               ...fan-taas-tic example of
               Florentine marble... Who will start
               at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

     Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
     hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
     Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one
     seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                             HAWK
               All these years of attending auctions,
               I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,
               the sculptures....the things that
               aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                             THE WOMAN
               .... the pretentious vultures who
               don't even look up from their
               calculators to see what they're
               buying.  Now that gives me
               goosebumps.  Auctions are
               disgusting.

                             HAWK
               I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

     The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce
               attributed to the Cellini school..

     AUCTION ENTRANCE

     Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
     wearing a blue ribbon.

     AUCTION AREA

     Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An
     oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
     BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
     figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
     A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
     and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

     THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
     phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his
     arm.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Sold!  To the caller from
               Newfoundland.

     A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
     of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
     it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs
     and shakes his head.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER
               And finally, Lot number 17,
               thought to be lost in the war,
               and again last night, the Da
               Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
               sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

                             HAWK
                       (re: Auctioneer)
               Is looking like a constipated
               warthog a prerequisite to getting
               a job in the art world?

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               There have naturally been questions
               of its authenticity, so to verify
               we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
               Vatican.  Doc?

                             ANNA
                       (rising, to Hawk)
               Some of us warthogs are more
               constipated than others.

     Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of
     distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation.

                             HAWK
               Oh, the shit is going to hit the
               fa--

                             ANNA
                       (suddenly serene)
               Fantastic.  Perfection.  The
               Vatican extends its jealousy to
               the lucky bidder.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               We'll begin the bidding at 82.5
               million dollars.  To you, sir.
               Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,
               madame--Ninety point five.....

     Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming
     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk
     floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it.

                             DARWIN MAYFLOWER
               lOO million clams, Francesco!

     The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
     MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
     appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
     fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
               Mayflower.

     Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
     Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She
     swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

     Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
     her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                             MINERVA
               Francesco, 100 million and one.

     Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.

                             DARWIN
               Outbid by my own wench, quelle
               bummere.

                             MINERVA
               Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
               million and one dollars.

     Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
     of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi-
     ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

     The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
     cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
     eyeline to Hawk.

     Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating Big Stan.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle.

     The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Gone!

     The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

     Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

     Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
     in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

     The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

     Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

     Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

     The Gavel hits.

     Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
     podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
     battered crowd.

     Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
     position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
     rising from the ground.

     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.

     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing
     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

                             ANNA
               My God, that was bold of you,
               you didn't have to do that...

                             HAWK
               Forget about it--it was nothing--
               anybody would have done the same
               thing--It's an impulse...

                             ANNA
               No, I meant you didn't have to
               tackle me and rip my dress.  A
               polite push, perhaps?  A clear
               shout of "watch out, Anna"
               would have done nicely...

                             HAWK
               Excuse me, Milady.  I would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud, but I left my cape
               at the cleaners.

     Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                             ANNA
                       ("Hey, I was kidding")
               Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
               Why was the guard chasing you?

                             HAWK
                       (Serious answer?
                        Na-a-h?)
               Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

     Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere
     hammers him into the ground and the viewer into
     darkness.

     FADE IN:

     INT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT

     Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated
     gurney.

                             HAWK
               Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole
               cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,
               but I'll take the worst cloud you
               got...

     Hawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him.

                             CESAR
               News flash.  You're not in
               heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and
               counting, if you know what I'm
               saying.  Couldn't just play along,
               could you...

     EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT

     The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.

     INT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Antony raises up a mammoth gun.

                             HAWK
               Pretty class way of covering your
               tracks.  I think that auctioneer
               landed at La Guardia.

                             ANTONY
               Subtlety was never one of our
               strong points.

                             HAWK
               Neither's flossing.

     A confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand.
     Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby
     trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul-
     ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the
     partition.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white,
     freaks at the starred windshield.

     THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

     The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars.

     INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor
     brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward.

     OUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE

     The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

     The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking.

     A sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT
     --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney!

     Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road.

     THE GURNEY

     Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface.

     The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition.

     Hawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM.

                             HAWK
               Life don't get much better than
               this.

     He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane.

     Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran-
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     FLINGS the change from twenty feet away.

     TOLL BOOTH

     The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the
     gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm.

     EXT. THE AMBULANCE

     CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     Cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             CESAR
               Make him into Roadkill!

     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

                             ANTONY
               Yeah, run him down!

     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     THE AMBULANCE

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down

     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD

     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

     Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             HAWK
               This is the worst night...

                             SNICKERS
               When it rains, it pours.  Name's
               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
     the "outfit."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.
               But it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               Diseases.  You don't know what
               it's like being called Clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               Whoops, forgot....

     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the
     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop
     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               My name's Butterfinger.

                             HAWK
               No shit.

     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE
     KAPLAN.

                             KAPLAN
               Don't you just hate kids...

                             ALMOND JOY
               George, you promised.  No Old CIA/
               New CIA jokes...

                             KAPLAN
               I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks
               think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
               They think the Cold War involves
               penguins and...

                             HAWK
               Don't I know you...

                             KAPLAN
               You just might.  I'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  At
               the time, I was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and I had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               I won't be offended.

                             HAWK
               Bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     Hawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             HAWK
               But I'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             KAPLAN
               I used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               I was shredding documents in the
               basement.  Deep down, I guess I
               was just jealous.  You were one
               incredible thief...

                             HAWK
               To what do I owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.

                             KAPLAN
               I Want to make things up to you.
               That's why I got you this gig,
               doll.  Hawk, my name's George
               Kaplan and to quote the late,
               great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
               just begun."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  If you think I'm doing
               another...

                             KAPLAN
               Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

                             HAWK
               Employer?  The president?

                             KAPLAN
               No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.
               what's that up there?

                             HAWK
               I'm supposed to fall for that?

                             KAPLAN
               Shucks.  Guess not.

     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
     sticker.

     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY

     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as "O
     Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               No.  Way.

     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler
     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome to Rome, sir.

                             HAWK
               Yes way.

     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY

     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...

     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE

     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             DARWIN
               For those kind of wages, I could
               have built the factory in America!
               They're Vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?
               I hear depressing news like this
               and I want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!
               The Hawkster!  What do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             HAWK
               You could host American Bandstand
               in here.  Why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             DARWIN
               Because I didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                             DARWIN
               What can I tell you, I'm the
               villain.  Initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, I thought
               what the heck.  Hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  I would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, I want
               to be in business with you.

     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER

     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             HAWK
               My life is not some deal.  I...

                             ALFRED (O.S.)
               It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

                             DARWIN
               I'm sorry, I have to take this.
               Those are valid points though...

     Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
     Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             DARWIN
               You better have a good excuse...
               You better have a better excuse!
               You are so weak!  I'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle America or else my name
               would be Running Brave or Vomiting
               Antelope...Really.  Well, listen
               close, babe.

     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING
     NOISE fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             DARWIN
               Shall we?

     Darwin bolts out.  Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod
     Serling to explain things, then bolts out too.

     EXT. E.U.R. DISTRICT BUILDING--DAY

     Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  Alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             DARWIN
               So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
               words...

                             HAWK
               Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you
               own Park Place, you own the four
               railroads.  You think you're God.
               For all I know, you're probably
               right.  I just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               Nintendo after I find out what it
               is.  Man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  What am I saying, you
               did buy it...

                             DARWIN
               Oh... Let's see.  There are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "Sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the Da Vinci
               museum we're building in Vinci.
               Hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               If I seem vague, grand.  We want a
               low profile on this, that's why I
               got Kaplan and the Candy bars
               involved.  I helped George help
               the Mario Brothers and Gates help
               get you out....

                             HAWK
               If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  So boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             DARWIN
               Way to go, Alfie!  How many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   Good help's hard to find.

                             HAWK
               I guess that's a no.

     INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,
     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.

     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to Minerva.

                             DARWIN
               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     The board members go into tableau silence.  Minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...

                             DARWIN
               And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up
               for Hudson Hawk.

     The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                             MINERVA
               Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva lobs a ball in the air.  Bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees
     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     Minerva paces up upon the table.

                             DARWIN
               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             MINERVA
               That's two hundred dollars a day?
               So he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

                             HAWK
               Guess I know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             MINERVA
                       (jumping off table)
               For God's sake, chain this
               convict.

     With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     The Board Members politely applaud.  Alfred pulls Hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             MINERVA
               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the Codex.

                             DARWIN
               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               It's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  But now finally I got my
               new goal.  World domination.  With
               your help...Bunny....quit that!

                             MINERVA
               Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

                             HAWK
               Think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  Five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     Minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             HAWK
               Anybody have a cigarette?  But
               seriously, do me a favor and
               Concorde me back to prison.  I
               don't care anymore.  I hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             MINERVA
               You go back, you won't be alone.
               You'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  You're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "Alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               Depressing.

                             HAWK
               You wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  You have no proof.

                             DARWIN
               Ah, the magic word...

     Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     The Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             DARWIN
               It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something
               you wish never happened.  We shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               Hired the guy who did the last
               Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
               Excellent work... whoops, damn
               Fotomat assholes...

     A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in
     Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  He clicks ahead...

     Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an
     annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

     Minerva leans over in front of him.

                             MINERVA
               Tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY

     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.

     INT. THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish Italian sunglasses.

                             HAWK
               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns
               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end
               up doing this...

     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.

     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM

     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.

     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM

     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope
     performing a Coronation.

                             HAWK
                       (half-hearted)
               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed
               into robbing the Vatican by a
               psychotic American corporation
               along with a CIA...

                             VATICAN GUARD
               "You're being".....uh, I don't,
               uh...

     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

                             HAWK
               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a
               jaywalker.

     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY

     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking
     for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                             HAWK
               Operator, I want to make a collect
               call to Alex Messina, New York....

     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.

     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM

     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the
     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze...

     THE DA VINCI CODEX

     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

     The case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

                             ANNA (V.O.)
               But it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible.

     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                             ANNA
               Tough guy.  What are you--How's
               your head.

                             HAWK
                       (vegetable)
               Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

     She laughs, going into her public voice.

                             ANNA
               As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
               has lived in the Vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more.

                             HAWK
                       (under his breath)
               That's what you theenk.

                             ANNA
               Question, sir?   His untiring pen
               predicted the airplane, the
               submarine, the bicycle, the
               helicopter, and even the tank.
         
     A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
     bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate
               Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
                       (bad ventriloquism)
               Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big
               one!  why can't we go to the Epcot
               Center!

     The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.

                             ANNA
               These more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that ....

     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
     head.

     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off.

     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and
     spanked.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               Pokey, come back!

     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                             ANNA
               Come on, this stuff will knock you
               out.  Have you ever had the feeling
               you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                             HAWK
               Never, why do you ask?

     Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
     Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
     REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come
     flying out, baffled.

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE

     Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark
     circular staircase.

                             HAWK
               Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie
               Hawkins.
               My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't
               call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
               The Nuns at St. Agnes called me
               that and they're the ones who
               helped make me what I am today.
               Not a compliment...

                             ANNA
               Sure Hudson.  Are you going to
               tell me why you did that back there
               or are you going to blame it
               on Dumbo?

                             HAWK
               Could you believe that crazy
               elephant?

     Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

     INT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY

     A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags.
     Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times
               Square?

                             ANNA
               Delivers up to ten at night.  The
               Pope has an obsession with his
               Easter Seals.  It's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  The
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             HAWK
               The Vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             ANNA
               Nice.  But right out of our
               brochure.

                             HAWK
               Oh, you read that.

                             ANNA
               Actually I wrote it.  It's a good
               sentence.  It can apply to people.

                             HAWK
               You're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             ANNA
               I don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               And I buy my own clothes.  My
               life's a little boring...

                             HAWK
               God, I wish I could say the same
               thing.  What about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,
               Anecdotes about famous dead
               Italians....

                             ANNA
               I'll bring my entire repertoire...

     The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down.

                             HAWK
               And I'll bring my entourage...

                             ANNA
               Secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  There's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

                             HAWK
               Said.

     Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls
     out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
     She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             ANNA
               Father, it's obvious.  He's up to
               something.

     Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             JESUS (Italian)
               Report downstairs at once.

                             ANNA
               Yes, sir.

     INT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA

     A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna
     clacks up to him.

                             CARDINAL
               Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                             ANNA
               No, your Eminence.  I think he's
               going to steal the Codex, as
               early as next week.

                             CARDINAL
               Attempt, you mean.  The vanity
               of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The
               Vatican has foiled the advances
               of Pirates and Terrorists.  We
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from New Jersey.  Must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             ANNA
               That's the best kind.  A wise
               woman once said "Polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             CARDINAL
                       (chuckling)
               Let me be the one to quote
               Scripture.  ....As an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  Just
               remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             ANNA
                       (unconvinced)
               Yeah.  The big E.

     EXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY

     The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
     off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into...

     INT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH

     Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             HAWK
               Hello, operator.  I'd like to
               make a collect call to New York
               number...

     The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious Hawk.

                             HAWK
               Thank you, operator, thank you.

     Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the
     limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, pick up, you
               Reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT

     It is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the
     bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.

     INT. PIAZZA--DAY

     Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
     Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva
     and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             HAWK
               A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

     Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda
     tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is
     dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     Hawk gives him a double take.

                             KAPLAN
               Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying
               Italy?  I always had a soft spot
               for Rome.  Did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  Communist
               politician.

                             HAWK
               Why George, you big softie...

                             KAPLAN
               God, I miss communism.  The Red
               Threat.  People were scared, the
               Agency was respected, and I got
               laid every night.

     A humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  Kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Sorry, coach...

                             KAPLAN
                       (shaking his head)
               If his father wasn't the head of
               Shit, I hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the Mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,
               it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             HAWK
               You know Kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, I'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             SNICKERS
               Good news, bud, the Mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

                             HAWK
               Tonight?  You're whacked.  The
               timing's off, I'm underequipped
               Damnit, I have a date!

     Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, Pocket
               Fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               Gee Stud, this is going to be
               some date.  No Harvey's Bristol
               Cream?

                             KAPLAN
               Snickers, make the list happen.
               Oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the Mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  I've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             HAWK
               Thanks for sharing.

                             KAPLAN
               We blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  You and your friend
               Alex would be a late afternoon
               Triscuit.

                             HAWK
               If you do anything to my friend...

                             KAPLAN
               Yeah, right.  By the way, as long
               as I'm getting things off my
               chest, I'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  Made it look like
               a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.
               Ciao.

     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves
     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             HAWK
               What did you have against Little
               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               Come back without your yuppie
               army.  I'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...Shit.!

     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.

     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but
     Butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
               stamps!

     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.

     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK

     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     The train zips into a tunnel.

     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO
     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh
     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     A hand rips out of the huge package.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             HAWK
               "Beware the Odd Steps."

     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             HAWK
               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The
     acid sizzles.

     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman....

     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through
     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down
     the hall.

     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.
     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.

     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors.

     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to
     be standing.

     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and
     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND
     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's
     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
     on the other side of the room.

     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one
     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard
     pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting
     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to
     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window.

     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
     landing against the antennae.

     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM

     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian
     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre
     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the
     Guard continues to bound forward.

                             HAWK
               Please God, Please God.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
     Guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             VATICAN GUARD
               The worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.

     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL

     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of
     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride.

     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.

     HAWK

     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon...

     EXT. A BUS

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
     flying off...

     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT

     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes
     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             HAWK
               I never break a date.  Scout's
               honor.

     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
     table.

                             HAWK
               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

                             WAITER
               Bellissimo, signor.

                             HAWK
               Oh, and could I have some ketchup
               with that.

     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other
     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.

     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             SNICKERS
               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
               Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,
               you gotta have French.....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread.

                             SNICKERS
               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all
               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man
               Kaplan thinks since Communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,
               Democracy isn't free elections.
               We gotta teach the world that
               Democracy is Big Tits, College
               Football on Saturdays, Eddie
               Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
               and Kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "America's
               Funniest Home Videos."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...Jesus, I
               gotta get out of this job.  If
               my Mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-Apartheid movement....

                             SNICKERS
               Quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
               and in love.

     They look off to....

     HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

     Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it.

                             HAWK
               This is bueno.  They had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             ANNA
               Prison?

                             HAWK
               I was the Warden?

                             ANNA
               How long were you in?

                             HAWK
               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

                             ANNA
               Wow, you were "in the joint."
               "Doing hard time."  It's funny,
               but that excites me.  I seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             HAWK
               I seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  Check please....

                             WAITER
               Ah, anything for dessert?

                             ANNA
                       (she shoots)
               Yes.  Something to go.

                             HAWK
                       (she scores)
               I'll bring the ketchup.

       INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling
       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             ANNA
               What have you been doing?

                             HAWK
               Uh....old badminton injury.

     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             HAWK
               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

                             ANNA
                       (not stopping)
               Oh, I'm so sorry...

     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             ANNA
               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

                             HAWK
                       (softly approaching)
               Hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  I don't make
               love every ten years, I get a
               little cranky.

                             ANNA
               It's also been a long time for
               me.  I--

     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                             HAWK
               Catholic girls are scary...

                            ANNA
               Somebody robbed the Vatican.

                            HAWK
               Oh.  No.

     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.
     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She
     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             HAWK
               It's not what you think.  Okay,
               maybe it is....

                             ANNA
               You really went and did it.  With
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  Nobody
               does it better, Hudson.  You
               started the week stealing the
               Sforza and you ended it swiping
               the Codex.

                             HAWK
               Wha--

                             ANNA
               What are your plans for the
               weekend?  Hoisting away the
               Colosseum?  Tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

     EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

     Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
     Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              SNICKERS
               What's going on in there?

                              BUTTERFINGER
               Do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               Dunkin does it better.

                              SNICKERS
               Just read, Butterfinger.

     Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               "Da Vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             ALMOND JOY
               To yourself!.....What are they
               doing?  In twenty seconds, we go
               in.

     INT. ANNA'S PLACE

     Foam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at
     it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             ANNA
               For two years, I've been tracking
               the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their
               Sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             HAWK
               Does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  Jesus, I'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....Lifted a
               piece of licorice when I was one
               and a half.  Who knew it would
               lead... They even got the CIA
               involved!

                             ANNA
               The C.I. what?  God, no...

                             HAWK
                       (raising his cup)
               Ooh, I guess I do know something
               Here's looking at you, kid...

     THE CAR OUTSIDE

     The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Now.

     ANNA'S HOUSE

     Hawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts.

                             HAWK
               This doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             ANNA
               Oh, I must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in
     Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             ANNA
               Why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               Vatican tonight.  My people will
               not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

                             ALMOND JOY
               That's not overly possible.  He...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               But guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at Vinci....

     Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

     EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
     opening Da Vinci sequence.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering.

     INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

     A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     Kaplan.

     Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

     Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she
     comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

                             KAPLAN
               Way to go, Anna.

                             ANNA
               When the Mayflowers find out we
               have the Codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             KAPLAN
                       (gung-ho lying)
               And then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... Is that it?

     Hawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

                             ANNA
               Actually George, it's not it.
               What are we doing in this castle?
               I happen to know the Mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out Da Vinci used to
               do...

     The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da
     Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             KAPLAN
                       (trying to be solemn)
               It's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  Operation
               Deflower Mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             ANNA
                       (taking it in)
               Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
               that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               Darwin, Minerva, and you.
               Basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             KAPLAN
               Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were
               true, Almond Joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the Codex.
               Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

     Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

                              ANNA
               Cat got his tongue?

                              KAPLAN
               Actually he never told us what it
               was.

     Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             ANNA
               How sweet.  I trust you will see
               Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  I recommend
               leniency...

                             SNICKERS
                       (holding in a laugh)
               Oh, I think we all do.

     Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     Kit Kat.

                             SNICKERS
               Do you think she has any idea that
               Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
               bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

                             KAPLAN
               I don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             ALMOND JOY
               With all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't I cut out her
               heart?

                             KAPLAN
               Close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious Vatican organization.
               Hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
     Kat who fakes one back.

     INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             DARWIN
               Seven!

     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a
     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             ALFRED
               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

                             MINERVA
               Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  You are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             DARWIN
               Haven't you ever seen, like David
               Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             MINERVA
               Like a "cat", one could say.

                             HAWK
               Shucks, I'll just take it back.

     Hawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to
     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             MINERVA
                       (bouncing up)
               No, let me!

                             DARWIN
                       (pout)
               I don't care.

     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             HAWK
               Another piece of the puzzle for
               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     Flunkies.

                             DARWIN
               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I
               hate than failure.  All you had to
               do was follow the Hawk, it's not
               like I said "Teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             DARWIN
               I guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             DARWIN
               God Minerva, I was kidding.

     A SHOCKED HAWK

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

     THE MAYFLOWERS

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,
     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

                             MINERVA
               Get away from there, convict!

                             HAWK
               Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

     Snickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             DARWIN
               Don't hurt him!  We need him for
               the final job!

     Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

                             HAWK
               Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even
               if I do this....

     Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             HAWK
               And this....

     Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

                             HAWK
               Surely this must offend....

     Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
     ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

                             KAPLAN
               That's it!

     Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             HAWK
               Things are getting a little loose
               at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
               "Put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  May I call you
               Minnie....

     Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's
     crotch.  Hawk stops dancing.

                             DARWIN
               Come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             HAWK
               Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing
               like Franki Valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     Alfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs.

                             MINERVA
               Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

                             HAWK
               Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,
               I'm involved in this thing, so I
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               I wanna be treated as an adult.

                             DARWIN
               That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in
               Rome.  Now go to your room.

     Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.  He falls.

     INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The lips of Anna come into light.

                             ANNA
               Forgive me Father for I have
               sinned.  It's been 1200 hours
               since my last confession.

     INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

     The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             CARDINAL
               Hit me with your best shot.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An
               innocent man.  A thief.

                             CARDINAL
               Anna, what are you trying to say...

     ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

                             ANNA
               He came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  But he knew Right and
               Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     THE CARDINAL

     freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

                             CARDINAL
               "Messed around" messed around?  I
               know-- I don't want to know.  First
               base?  Second Base?  Stop me when
               I'm getting warm...

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               A little petting is not the issue!

                             CARDINAL
               Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and
               five minutes outside.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             CARDINAL
               So let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               Mayflowers but Kaplan and the
               Candy Bars are?

     Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun.  The gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             ANNA
               You got it.  Operation Deflower
               Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the
               punchline.  I thought we were using
               the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,
               but really the CIA was using me to
               keep us away from Mayflower.

                             CARDINAL
               Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
               in charge of catering.... If the
               Mayflowers get the three sections
               of Da Vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of
               Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             ANNA
               I'm going to find out.

                             CARDINAL
               I'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to God as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             ANNA
               I know, I know, your Eminence, just say
               "God go with me."

                             CARDINAL
               God go with you, sister.

     Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  She moves off....

     INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                             DARWIN
               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  In the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             MINERVA
               Surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             HAWK
                       ("What's my Line")
               That's two down to Kitty
               Carlisle...

     Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  He rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests Alfred.

                             MINERVA
               Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  On the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  Great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             HAWK
               Alchemy.

                             DARWIN
                       (casually goosing Alfred)
               Alchemy!  Is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  Minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  I dumped
               some lira into research... Shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
               La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  Money
               isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck
               blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!
               Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real
               deal!  Money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             MINERVA
               Market crashes.  Bomb drops.
               Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  In 1992,
               Europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  It's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             DARWIN
               Well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

                              HAWK
               Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.
               The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,
               this is all too Indiana Jones and
               the Lost City of King Tut for me,
               man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw Alex...

                             MINERVA
               Jail, you asshole!  Our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             DARWIN
               I'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  I'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the Prom!

                             HAWK
               You want an address on that last
               one?

     Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

                             HAWK
               Bunny, not you too?

                              MINERVA
               You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I
               think I know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing Hawk.

                              HAWK
               I'll kill all you.  Even the old
               lady.


     Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     Italian leather coat.

                             ALEX
               I hated cigarettes until I saw my
               first No Smoking sign.  Keep off
               the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.
               Only law I cared about was
               friendship.  Broke that one too,
               didn't I?  This Gates-Mario
               Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               Visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  I don't know, I thought
               you'd get into it.  It's better
               than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
               the bar.  I didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  Them using
               me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

     EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

     The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
     with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
     Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
     center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the
     periphery....

                              KAPLAN
               I just don't think it was a
               smoking hot idea to leave them up
               there alone.

                             MINERVA
               Don't worry George, this is the
               reason we put the old diabetic
               guinea on the payroll to begin
               with.  To keep Hawk in line.
               They'll talk about "being buddies"
               and "chugging brewskis."

                             DARWIN
                       (raising glass)
               You gotta love male bonding.

     As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
     Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

                              KAPLAN
               You were saying...

     Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
     holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
     continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers-
     by give them space.

                             HAWK
               You bastard!  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job!

     Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily
     raises his gun.

                             ALEX
               Hawk... I'm so sorry...

     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They
     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
     Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
     happening" catatonia.

     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
     ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                             HAWK
               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't
               go out like this.

     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
     Snickers stops.

     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds
     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
     The other two drag in Alex.

     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
     as the van pulls away.

                             MINERVA
               Plan B, anyone...

     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....

     AROUND A CORNER

     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
     way.

     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He
     hits his handle with frustration.

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck
     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             ANNA
               Oh thank God, you're dead...

                             ALEX
               It was so beautiful!  When the
               blanks went off, they...

     Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

                             HAWK
               You bastard.  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             ALEX
               But I said I was sorry....

                             HAWK
               No sweat, Alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  What
               was your per-diem?

                             ALEX
               Don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I
               made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, don't you understand...

                             HAWK
               And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
               I don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  I'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             ANNA
               I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
               I-care-for-you...

                             HAWK
               Oh.  Well, what's this?

     Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
     Museum from out of his pocket.  Anna turns white.

                             ANNA
               Where did you get this?

                             HAWK
               You know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the Codex.... the
               Mayflower Museum.

                             ANNA
               It's from the machine.  All they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  We
               can't let that happen.

                             ALEX
               You're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             ANNA
               Something like that.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I
               are going to Rio.  We're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  Right,
               buddy?...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, God's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             HAWK
               You better believe I can.  I'm
               sick of people telling me what I
               have to do.

                             ANNA
               It's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             HAWK
               Selfish attitude?  I'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             ANNA
               You re not "some guy" anymore,
               Hudson.  Right now, you're the
               only guy.  Without your help, I....

     Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.  The
     weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             HAWK
               The world is beautiful.  Every day
               in prison I made sure to remember
               that.  It's only when I actually
               got out that I forgot.  If I was
               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
               But being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  The world is
               beautiful and I'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  Alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             ANNA
               That was beautiful.

                             ALEX
               I laughed, I cried.

     Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     Alex.

                             HAWK
               Rio, Alex?  After all they've
               done to...Hey, these tickets are
               for Moscow!

                             ALEX
                       (knowing smile)
               Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin
               thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

     A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
     ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
     bullet holes.  Anna sweetly intervenes.

                             ANNA
               Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

     The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

                             KAPLAN
               We're all family now.  My team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             SNICKERS
               We're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for American imports.

     Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
               located in a wing of the Kremlin
               that they used to throw the Miss
               Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             KAPLAN
               As for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...

     INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

     A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer.
     Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             ALEX
               We're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             HAWK
               Geez, this Art Treasures Room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             HAWK
               Hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             ANNA
               Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit
               nervous.  I'm sorry I could only
               score clergy passports.

                             HAWK
               Fits my new image.  A thief for
               the masses.  This is one job I'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  Gum.

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     Hawk holds.

                             ALEX
               The security's actually not that
               severe.

                             ANNA
               It doesn't have to be.  Everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               Kremlin, you'll end up in a
               Siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of
     Budapest.

                             HAWK
               Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               I can't believe this is the Iron
               Curtain.  All the guy at Airport
               customs wanted to know was "Who
               Shot J.R.?"

                             ALEX
               You sound disappointed.

                             HAWK
               Yeah, I mean, come on, going
               through the Iron Curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     THE VAN

     passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

                             HAWK (V.O.)
               It's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....

     EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

                             SNICKERS
               We are the blue light.  The green
               light is where the Art Treasures
               room is.

                             KAPLAN
               Let's go make a purple light.
               Where's Kit Kat?

     EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They
     scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

                             ALEX
               Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

                             ANNA
               Gum.

     All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

                             HAWK
               Count of three?

                             ALEX
               Why not just go now?

                             HAWK
               Okay.

     The Trio rush for the door.

     THE KREMLIN ROOF

     SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?

     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.  The Guard
     swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

     THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...

     INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.
     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael
     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE
     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the
     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush
     ahead.

     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     Snickers' apparatus rings.  Kaplan answers it.

                             KAPLAN
               Everything's going fine, Minerva,
               thanks for asking...

     INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

     Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with
     Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank.

                             MINERVA
               I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
               anyway....

     INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.  Threaten-
     ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

                             HAWK
                       (Wizard of Oz)
               Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

     They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             MINERVA
               Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     The servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an M.  A GROUP
     OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the
     Mayflowers at the table.

     THE ROOF

     Kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             KAPLAN
               Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat
     is.  He holds up an "About Time" card.  The agents laugh
     and greet them.

     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN
     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             ALEX
               Eighth room down, babe...

                             ANNA
               Guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             HAWK
               Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

     Our trio charges down the hallway.

                             HAWK
               "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             ALEX
               "Maybe we're ragged and funny."

     They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT
     LOCK.  They go to work on it.  Not losing the beat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "But we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  Side by Side..."

     INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

     With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

                             KAPLAN
               Create a diversion.

     Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-Uzis.

     SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing SNAP.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED
     GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             ALEX
               Now that's a lock.

                             HAWK
               Don't worry, we'll get it...

                             ANNA
               Can I sing this time, too?
               Please?

     Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             HAWK
               Uh, I guess so.

     The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR
     tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks
     as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

                             DARWIN
               I look at you Soviet people and I
               feel... pity... superiority.  Most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that Capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a Cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             MINERVA
                       (smiling)
               We're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             DARWIN
               So let's get busy.  Have some fun
               and make some deals.

     AT THE LOCK

     Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     They are improvising...

                             HAWK
               "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             ALEX
               "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and
     Alex can barely concentrate.

                             ANNA
               "But we'll travel the road, Sharing
               the load.  Side by Side!"

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex
     are working on.

     Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             SNICKERS
               This is the room above the Art
               Treasures room.  The lock is a
               Natalya Z-Z, first created...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Snickers, baby, I love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               Silencer bomb...

     Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

     come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

                             HAWK
               That was close....

                             ALEX
               Anna, I think you better stay....

                             HAWK
               You can be lookout!.....  Take
               Alex's gun.

     Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little
     Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through
     the doors.

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

     Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

                             ANNA
               "You can be the lookout."

     Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers
     and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     THE BALLROOM FLOOR

     A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball
     cap, addresses Darwin.

                             SOVIET LEADER
               Before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  We--

                             DARWIN
               Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.
               Listen up, for reasons I don't want
               to get into, I recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but I'm
               going to re-build it here and
               Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             HAWK
               "We all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             ALEX
               "But we'll be the same as we started...

     The lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into...

     INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

     Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed,
     with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "Just traveling along, singing a
               song.  Side--"

                             HAWK
               Geez, this place is a mess...

                             ALEX
               Voila...

     They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in
     the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches
     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,
     not sings.

                             ALEX
               Side by side, man...

     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the
     Candy Bars drop down behind them.

                             ALMOND JOY
               What the hell....

                             SNICKERS
               You're supposed to be dead!

                             ALEX
               I'm a ghost.  Boo.

                             HAWK
               I don't want to sound immature,
               but we were here first...

                             KAPLAN
               I wish I could think of those cute
               quips the way you can, Hawk, but
               I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

     Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex
     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but
     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his
     back.

                             HAWK
               No....

                             ALMOND JOY
               That was pretty uncool, George...

                             KAPLAN
               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
               me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.
               Ah, victory is so sweet....

     Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray,
     revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

                             MINERVA
               Yum.  This is the best meal I
               ever had...

     ANNA

     bulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's
     gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do....

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan is bugging out.

                             KAPLAN
               Damnit, this isn't the plan!
               Blue light, green light, shit!
               Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
               see if you can find out anything.

     They thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's
     oblivious clutches, shouts..

                             HAWK
               Can't you see the Mayflowers
               double-crossed you...

                             KAPLAN
               They may be scum, but if I get the
               Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
               roasting weenies on the beach.

                             HAWK
               I don't think you'll appreciate
               their choice of weenie.

     Kaplan raises his gun.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises
     a glass of vodka in the other.

                             DARWIN
               You're helping us achieve a goal
               and in return, I'm giving you a
               key to the world's executive
               washroom.  Don't piss it away....
               Skoal, amigos...

                              ANNA (O.S.)
               Stop or I'll shoot.

     Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to
     look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun.

                              ANNA
               You people are immoral and
               narcissitic and I won't let you...

     In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table
     begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the
     railing.

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan lowers his gun.

                             KAPLAN
               I can't believe this.  I'm in
               fucking Russia, or do I have to
               say, the fucking Soviet Union and
               I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
                       (raising back up
                        his gun)
               I never thought I'd say "I'm just
               in this job for the money."  Sad.
               Any last immature quips?

                             HAWK
               No.
                       (a beat)
               But why do you let Butterfinger
               keep those blood stains on his
               shirt?

     Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger
     looks down to his shirt.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               What blood stains....

     Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger.
     Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold
     Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's
     skull.

                             HAWK
               You want immature, how 'bout an
               egg fight...

     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's
     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals
     to the ground, geysering blood.

     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

                             HAWK
               Alex, are you....

                             ALEX
               I can't believe you didn't notice.
               My weight.  I lost ten pounds in
               Rome

                              HAWK
               You're a reed, man.  I gotta get
               Anna.  Hang in there...

     THE BALLROOM

     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-
     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight
     of Anna....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
               have to cut out your heart for
               real now.  It's not personal.

     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife.

                             ALMOND JOY
               You won't shoot.  I read your
               dossier... Sister.

     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The
     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone
     ballet.

                             ALMOND JOY
               I gotta get a new job...

     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of
     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,
     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-
     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success.

     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
     her level.  She bolts off....

     BALLROOM FLOOR

     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip
     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for
     cover, firing upward.

     KIT KAT

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the M.

     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another
     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot.

     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally
     creeps behind him.

     HAWK

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     Anna is bustling.  They hug...

                             ANNA
               The Mayflowers got...

     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in
     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting
     Mayflowers halt.

     KIT KAT

     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

     MINERVA

     breaks the standstill.

                             DARWIN
               What a pleasant surprise.  You're
               probably wondering...

                             HAWK
               But you're going to tell us
               anyway...

                             MINERVA
               I hate a man with a sense of
               humor.  While you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity, we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way: a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal.

                             HAWK
               If you think you're getting past
               me...

     Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the
     ground.

                             HAWK
               Don't be stupid...they...

                             SNICKERS
               Bastard!  If you were a true
               American.

                             HAWK
               Just shut up and hit me!

     Snickers swings a punch.  Hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest.

     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her
     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

     KIT KAT

     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs
     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

     A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY
     HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

     Alfred discards him over the edge.

     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

     The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

     HAWK

     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a
     staircase.

     DARWIN

     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred
     approaches.

                             DARWIN
               Alfred, the getaway car...

     SNICKERS

     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

                             HAWK
               Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat
               burglar!  Nobody said anything
               about this fight-to-the-death
               shit.

                             SNICKERS
               Too bad.

     Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

     Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of
     the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

     Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They
     start to trot off...

                             MINERVA
               I knew it!  I told you it was a
               fake.

                             DARWIN
               That New-York-Italian-Father-
               made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
               of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A
               million?

                             MINERVA
               Million five, lover...

     HAWK

     boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

                             SNICKERS
               Help me you Democratic Reform
               lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you
               Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!
               Oh God, I always wanted to know
               how to play the harp, there
               just was so little time!  Rosebud!

     The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears.
     Nothing happens.

                             SNICKERS
               Maybe it was just a....

     Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

     THE STAIRCASE

     Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

                             ALEX
               Get 'em.  They went down the
               hallway.

                             HAWK
               Let's just forget it, I mean...

                             ALEX
               Get em....

     Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance
     to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past
     a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward.

     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-
     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin
     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

                             MINERVA
               Alex.  How's it going?

                             ALEX
               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

                             MINERVA
               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,
               Bon Appetite.

     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth.

     THE HALLWAY

     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives
     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk
     kicks him off...

                             HAWK
               Oh, come on....

     THE BALLROOM

     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.

                             MINERVA
               Very good, Alex, but you re
               still alive....

     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last
     burst of strength, punches her across the face.

                             MINERVA
               That's fair.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

                             HAWK
               Why does this have to be so hard...

                             KAPLAN
               Tell me about it...

     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness.

     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-
     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with
     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into
     Kaplan's hands.

                             HAWK
               Take this to Hell with you...

     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine.

                             KAPLAN
               My pension.....

     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield.

     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.

     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into....

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The
     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's
     gun goes off..

     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing
     down on the accelerator.

     THE LIMOUSINE

     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors.

     THE BACKSEAT

     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall.

     INT. BACKSEAT

     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.
     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.
     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

                             DARWIN
               God-damnit, I only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image.
               I'm a regular Joe...

     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning
     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind.

     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.

     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

                             DARWIN
               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,
               let's talk abut this.

     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's
     body connects with the mural.

     INSIDE THE LIMO

     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the
     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan
     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

                             HAWK
               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value...

     THE BALLROOM

     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has
     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

                             HAWK
               Oh, honey....

     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way
     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.

                             HAWK
               We did it man, we...

     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written
     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind
     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back
     to the ground.

     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,
     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,
     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene.

     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY

     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A
     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson...

                             HAWK
               I told you not to call me Hudson.
               The only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
               Catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             HAWK
                       (cut-off laugh)
               This is too bad to be false.

     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome back to Vinci.

                             HAWK
               Last rites, sister?

                             ANNA
               Please, no nun jokes...They're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              HAWK
               She killed Alex.

     Alfred gives them a push.

     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball
     machine.

     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da
     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              MINERVA (O.S.)
               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              MINERVA
               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  Anna.....

     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              MINERVA
               I want you to monitor the Da
               Vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that Darwin and
               I's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               Beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               Alfie and I were up all night with
               the thing.

     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the
     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              HAWK
               You killed a friend.  Why should I
               help you go for the gold?

                              MINERVA
               It'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but I'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               Brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-
               crash.  Financial Empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              HAWK
               Except yours-yours.  The goal of
               world domination.  Well, if you
               put it that way, Minnie.  How can
               I resist?

                              MINERVA
               You can't, convict!  You're just
               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  It rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "How could this
               happen to me?"  It's a natural
               inclination.  But for I, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               You are on my planet!  You walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  The lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              ANNA
               Do it.  There's no reason to fight
               anymore.  She's a force of nature.

     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              MINERVA
               If you pull this off, I can't
               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,
               who we trying to kid?  But I will
               spare the Flying Nun here....

                              HAWK
               And to think I thought you were
               Evil Incarnate in pumps.

                              MINERVA
               I killed some lovable working
               class Italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  So don't play with
               me.

     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed
     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              HAWK
               Okay, fine!

     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He
     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them
     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.
     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,
               team, go!

     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da
     Vinci had it in his machine.

     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              HAWK
               I hope you know what....

                              ANNA
               Trust Leonardo....

                              HAWK
               Wha.....

     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              MINERVA
                       (into the headset)
               We're for real.

     THE MACHINE

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  The arms click higher.

     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     ANNA

     murmurs to Hawk.

                              ANNA
               Da Vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that I decoded.
               The way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  Isn't it
               wonderful?

                              HAWK
               Yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              ANNA
               Wha -- you don't want to know...

     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              HAWK
               I wanna know...

                              ANNA
               Holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               Da Vinci would be proud of you.

     IN THE MACHINE

     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     EVERYONE

     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     THE MACHINE

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,
     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

     THE MACHINE

     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     MINERVA

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Eureka, motherfuckers!

     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)
               Minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     HAWK AND ANNA

     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on
     head-set.

                              HAWK
               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
               say you got the Midas touch, baby...

     MACHINE

     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

     HAWK AND ANNA

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
     on his chest, ALFRED!

                              ALFRED
               How.

                              HAWK
               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss
               is dead.  Her plan is over.

                              ALFRED
                       (strange voiced)
               My plan is just beginning.  I'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but I'm afraid
               the birth of the new British
               Empire can have no witnesses!

                              HAWK
               Ooh-kay...

     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him
     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...

     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              ANNA
               Sorry!

     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

                              HAWK
               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not
               kill!

     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick
     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
     throat.

     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which
     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the
     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "V" hits it--

                              HAWK
               Don't lose your head over this.

     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth
     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and
     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,
     HIGH IN THE AIR.

     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's
     head).

                              HAWK
               Excuse my crass American humor.

     The machine thunders with another explosion.

     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...

                              ANNA
               Allow me.

     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              HAWK
               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     Hawk slams down on the gadget.

     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.

     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE
     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
     to the ground.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
     through the glorious vista.

     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     Unforgettable Juggler.

                             JUGGLER
                         Che pazzo....

     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
     laugh again.

     A SMALL PIAZZA

     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
     atop it.

     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             HAWK
               Have I ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               I'd really like to play
               Nintendo with you, or something...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
               with God.
                       (smiling)
               But you're a close second, tough
               guy.  What is that smile?

                             HAWK
                       (broadly grinning)
               I got my planet back.

     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             HAWK
               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

                                                FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
               Leonardo, che pazzo.

     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...

     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE

     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
     glasses with his trademark beard.

     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
     syncrasies.

     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
     laser show.

                             DA VINCI
                       (silencing authority)
               Basta vapore.

     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace
     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
     ward with tongs.

     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS

     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.

     The tongs enter the frame.

     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar.

                             APPRENTICE TWO
               Maestro, che meraviglia!

                             APPRENTICE THREE
               Lei e' proprio fantastico!

     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

                             DA VINCI
               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

                             DA VINCI
               L'ho fatto.

     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other.

     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies.

     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water.

     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE

     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
     the Vinci vista.

     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:

     A HAWK

     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.

     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL

     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over
     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out
     of an eye-closed trance.

     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson
     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that
     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.

     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY

     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG
     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking
     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.

                             WISE GUARD
               We're losing our biggest celebrity
               today.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               You're kidding, Petey the Paint
               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

                             WISE GUARD
               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.
               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the
               great cat burglars.

     INT. PRISON CELL WALL

     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and
     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     THE BLOCK

     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.

                             WISE GUARD
               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.
               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You
               know, Crime used to have a little
               class.  A hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             HAWK
               Remind me to fire my publicist.

     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               Darn, these are for L-block...

     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter
     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     UNLOCK the door.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               - go back down to security and-

     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The
     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch
     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from Hawk.

                             WISE GUARD
               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             HAWK
               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             HAWK
               Oh, give this back to Petey in A
               block.  Tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but I think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             YOUNG GUARD
               The Paint Thinner Killer did
               this?  I think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             WISE GUARD
               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             HAWK
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               You got it.  A double.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY

     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and
     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             ANTONY
               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               We've got a proposition...

                              HAWK
               Answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
               how's the "Family?"  Kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              CESAR
               How many times do I have to say
               it?  I didn't put the hit on
               Little Eddie... Never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  I
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             HAWK
               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               That's your mark, man.  What did
               Little Eddie ever do to...

     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
     on the hood.

                             CESAR
               You're hitting Rutherford's
               Auction House.  Easy as my
               brother's wife.  Directions are
               in the bag.  Just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             HAWK
               Or you cut off my thingie.
               Directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             ANTONY
                       (defensively)
               Yeah, directions even I could
               understand.

     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             CESAR
               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware Store and sell
               spatulas...

                             HAWK
               If the Mario brothers weren't
               Jersey's third largest family,
               I'd say kiss my ass.  But
               considering your status, I'll
               say slurp my butt.

     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     Cesar's hands.

                             CESAR
               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

                             HAWK
               Baseball, why?

     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
     "Baseball."  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs
     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             HAWK
               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
     Hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             HAWK
               Help?  Police?

     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             CESAR
                       (unfazed)
               You need some time to think.
               That's cool, but next time, I'm
               not going to say "Please."

     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.
     Hawk seethes...

                             HAWK
               I don't believe this.  I've been
               out forty seconds...

     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to
     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             ALEX
               That's the first thing I did.
               Smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss
               anything?

                             HAWK
                       (getting up)
               Your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  Good to see you,
               Alex, been having a lousy day.

                             ALEX
               Lousy day?  The man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  What, you missing out
               on the Cell Block Water Ballet
               pageant?  Believe me, it's
               overrated.

     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

                             ALEX
               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this
               time, I promise.

     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             HAWK
               Looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             ALEX
               Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             HAWK
               My next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  Swear to God...
               tubby.

     EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

     The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
     Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             HAWK
               That's your definition of "Hard?"

                             ALEX
               Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come
               Fly with Me."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             ALEX
               Still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               I'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              HAWK
               Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--I'm going to take
               it so straight that I won't tape
               a Mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the National
               Baseball League.

                             ALEX
               Now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  Statue of
               Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?
               Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some
               women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some
               chicks?

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, let's just get to
               Alex's.  Your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               God, I'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  What the hell's a
               Nintendo?

                             ALEX
               Oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine European coffees?
               Who's your buddy?

     Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             HAWK
               The man knows, the man knows!

     Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             ALEX
               So Mr. Coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want
               me to do a job.

     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             ALEX
               Those dago-guinea-I can say
               this shit I'm Italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             HAWK
               Ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  Just get me to the bar...
               It's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....

     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.
     Sinatra cuts off.

     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT

     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             ALEX
               I didn't know how to tell you.  A
               couple brokers stopped in for
               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next
               thing I know Fast Track Digest
               votes us "Watering Hole of the
               Month."  Now, I'm shopping for
               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                             HAWK
               I read about these people in
               Newsweek.  Where's all the
               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the
               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's
               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain
               Bob's steering wheel?

                             ALEX
               Hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                             HAWK
               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat
               cheese?  I admit, I've been known
               to go wild and order a Canadian
               Bacon in my time, but..

     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
     immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Can you read.... smoker?

                             HAWK
               Can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
                       (Huh?)
               No.

                              HAWK
               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You
               know, I thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a V.C.R.
               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's
               why I became a serial arsonist.

                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke
               all you want.  Have mine....

     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

                             GATES (O.S.)
               You're under arrest...

     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             GATES
               Have a seat.  Good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             HAWK
               The pleasure's all yours, Officer
               Gates.

     BACK OF THE BAR

     With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table.

     GATES' TABLE

     Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  Gates eats around it.

                             GATES
               Why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               Especially after I got you such
               a nice job.

                             HAWK
               What job?

     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             GATES
               The auction house, asshole.  One
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  No
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               It's a great deal, I can't lie.

                             HAWK
               The only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  I know I was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  You know,
               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,
               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are
     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.

                             GATES
               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  I did dog and pony for
               you!  You think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the Three Stooges...

                             HAWK
               How was I supposed to know they
               were women?  Besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "Soitinly."

     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             GATES
               Remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             HAWK
               Yes.

                             GATES
               Remember that shoe you lost...

                             HAWK
               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             GATES
               One phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     Hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             HAWK
               What else do you got under there
               ... I don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             GATES
               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,
               but I can make it stick because
               I'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     Alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             ALEX
               How is everything tonight, sir?

                             GATES
               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

                             HAWK
               Alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             ALEX
               Sure.  That's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated Chuck
               Wagon.

                             GATES
                       (mouthful)
               You're full of shit.

     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             ALEX
               No, man, actually you are.  Just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets
     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.

     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN

     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,
     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's
     "Witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             ALEX
               Hmmmm.....

                             HAWK
               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk
     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             HAWK
               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
               Remember when the Captain.....

                             ALEX
               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it
     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.
     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             HAWK
               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last
               time I played the game, Simpson
               only had a 40.

                             ALEX
               Just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  You re
               still the best, I know it.

                             HAWK
               But you got three guards who...
               Shit, what am I doing?  Where's
               the want ads?  Gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             ALEX
               Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               This isn't funny.  I'm not into
               this.  I...

                             ALEX
               There goes five seconds...My
               record's eighteen.

                             HAWK
               You're not...LISTENING!

     Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             HAWK
               I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
               Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford
               Auction House.  By the way, how
               many seconds?

                             ALEX
               Rutherford Auction... that name...

     Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             HAWK
               Alex!

                             ALEX
               Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have
               to change them.  "Witchcraft."
               What's the running time?

     Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             HAWK
               3:48.  I can't get you involved,
               man.  This is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               God, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  Haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     Alex.

                             ALEX
               I'm in.  Have you seen the public
               service announcements for Diabetes.
               We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  I
               got a plan.  You won't have to hail
               Cesar or Gates.

     Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate.

                             HAWK
               I'm a bum.

     EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT

     TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
     They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."  IMPECCABLY
     DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.

     Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away...

     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
     that connects the Auction House with another Building.

     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
     beneath.

     AT THE WINDOW

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             ALEX
               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
               I'm wearing my girdle.

     INT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT

     Hawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk
     immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper-
     ing...

                             HAWK
               Cameras?

                             ALEX
               No need.  Guards' station's right
               there.

     Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a
     grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

     Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards'
     Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and
     Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

     INT. THE GUARDS' STATION

     Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke.
     Wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into...

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button
     flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them,
     sharing a cig.

                             ALEX
               They record everything their
               video surveillance takes in...

                             HAWK
               Yes, master-thief, I can see that.
               You said something about a plan...

     Alex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

                             ALEX
               Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.
               A little rewind and re-wire action
               and the Guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode.

     Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY.

     INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of
     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo Floor Washer.

     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
     and snooze.

     INT. GUARDS' STATION

     The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Check out Big Stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               Big Stan!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     THE FIRST FLOOR

     The laughing security guards see the crunch.

     INT. THE POWER ROOM

     Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R.

                             ALEX
               You got about five minutes and
               change.

                             HAWK
               5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

                             ALEX
               You know they invented something
               while you were inside.  Called a
               watch.

     A freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music
     of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               "A mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             ALEX
               "He kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     Hawk isn't.

     INT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     POWER ROOM

     Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large
     Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     The lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console
     screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Hell-o.  Check the Power room,
               bud...

     Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position...

     POWER ROOM

     Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the V.C.R.S.
     They now all have their PLAY buttons lit up.

                             ALEX
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     Alex.

     INSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     Alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     OUTSIDE THE POWER ROOM

     The singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the
     Guards' Station.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             HAWK
               "Or would you rather be a fish?"

     He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  Hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             BIG STAN
                       (moving back off)
               Very funny.

     The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  And the Blue Chair.

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM--CAMERA P.O.V.

     From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  But no Blue chair.

     HAWK

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             HAWK
                       (lyric trouble)
               "A fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               "He can't write his name or read
               a book.  To fool people is his
               only thought."

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

                             HAWK
                       (remembering)
               "And though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins
     the dial.  The CLICKS from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  Then there's a CLUNK.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
     a cup of coffee.  He doesn't swallow.

     His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh
     screen.  He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the
               seventh floor and I don't know
               how to say this, I see the Blue
               Chair.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               What the... You think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     Screen Two shows THE TWO SECURITY GUARDS THEMSELVES
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             SECURITY GUARD TWO
               Somebody rewired the recorders!

     AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's
     worktable.

     Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             HAWK
               "And all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             ALEX (V.O.)
               "Every day you meet quite a few."

     Alex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "So you see it's all up to you.
               You can be better than you are.
               You could be swinging on a star."

     THE AUCTION ROOM

     BIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R.

     THE GUARDS' STATION

     Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on.

                             SECURITY GUARD ONE
               Shit, let's roll!

     THE AUCTION AUDITORIUM

     Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             ALEX
               The song's over!  Come on!
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               What am I doing here?  There are
               so many things I wanna do that
               aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.
               Kiss a woman in Italy.

                             ALEX
                       (more frantically)
               "You could be swinging on a star."

                             HAWK
               Paint a woman in a lighthou--I
               don't want to steal a horse.
               Life is...

     Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and
     Two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             ALEX
                       (DEADPAN)
               "You could be swinging on a star."
               You couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

     Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the Guards into a bellyflop.

     Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             HAWK
               Let's go down the freight elevator.

     Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             ALEX
               Keep those ideas coming.

     Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.

     INT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE

     Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing.

                             ALEX
               I'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that Guard am I.

     Big Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               I got a bad feeling....

                             HAWK
               I can't even swim.

                             ALEX
               Hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     Big Stan raises his gun.

     Hawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the
     building....

     Closer and closer to the awning....

     The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls......

                                                CUT TO:

     RIGHT INTO A LAZ-Y-BOY CHAIR

     Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  The foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  A HAND pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.

     INT. GATES APARTMENT--LATE NIGHT

     Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat.)
     A sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs
     Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag.

     Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a-KEEP ON
     TRUCKIN'-T-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             GATES
               Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  How about a Gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               I used real hot dogs.

                             HAWK
               Weren't you the bartender at
               Jonestown?

     Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful
     Gatesirita sip.

                             CESAR
               Good job, not pretty, but good.

                             HAWK
               Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know
               how to party or what?

     Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             GATES
               All this trouble for a horsey.
               I may not know art, but I know
               what I like.

                             HAWK
                       (to Dog picture)
               You certainly do.

                             GATES
               So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-
               Buckingham-Palace-looking-
               Butlerhead getting here?

                             ALFRED
               Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

     A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
     distaste.  He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
     FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
     HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.
     Hawk notices this.

                             GATES
               Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

                             ALFRED
               I'll pass.  May I?

     Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             ALFRED
               Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo
               Da Vinci's last commission for the
               Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

                             GATES
               Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious
               for you.  Now where's my cut?

     With dignity, Alfred SMASHES the ancient horse over
     Gates's head.  Alfred rummages through the debris
     REVEALING a perversely labyrinthine CRYSTAL PIECE.
     (recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop).

                             GATES
               You son-of-a......I don't believe
               this!  You come into my house!

     Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             GATES
               I ought to take Big Ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     A blade slides down Alfred's arm.  Half-yawning, he...

     ALFRED'S 180 DEGREE POV

     spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him.
     THE BLADE goes back up Alfred's arm.

     The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  Gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             GATES
               Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

     Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  Gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  The Dog
     Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             ALFRED
               So much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               Excuse my dry British humor.

                             CESAR
                       (rising)
               Lovely work, Alfred, taking the
               Concorde back?

                             ALFRED
               Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             HAWK
               I hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             ANTONY
               You know, I think Gates promised
               Hawk a cut, too....

     The Mario brothers cackle out.  Hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             ALFRED
               Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

                             HAWK
                       (breathless)
               Too-do-loo, babe.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN

     Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             ALEX
               Did I miss anything?

                             HAWK
               Oh, not much.  Gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
         
                             ALEX
               Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             HAWK
               The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross
               between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.
               Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied
               dumptied it over Gates's head.  He
               said it was made by, get this,
               Leonardo..

                             ALEX
                       (professorial)
               Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
               Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               I consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  Horse things.

     The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             HAWK
               Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                             ALEX
                       (holding up newspaper)
               Morning edition.  Seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             HAWK
               "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but I do have my
               pride.  Face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, I....

     Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the
     Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
     and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

                             ALEX
               Why try?

                             HAWK
                       (hurdling the bar)
               Because I'm tired of not
               understanding things.  Cops,
               Mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out I really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               You re not thinking of going to...

                             HAWK
               Alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  Where's your tux?

     INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

     Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk
     enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
     all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
     items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               ...fan-taas-tic example of
               Florentine marble... Who will start
               at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

     Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
     hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
     Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one
     seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                             HAWK
               All these years of attending auctions,
               I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,
               the sculptures....the things that
               aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                             THE WOMAN
               .... the pretentious vultures who
               don't even look up from their
               calculators to see what they're
               buying.  Now that gives me
               goosebumps.  Auctions are
               disgusting.

                             HAWK
               I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

     The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce
               attributed to the Cellini school..

     AUCTION ENTRANCE

     Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
     wearing a blue ribbon.

     AUCTION AREA

     Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An
     oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
     BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
     figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
     A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
     and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

     THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
     phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his
     arm.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Sold!  To the caller from
               Newfoundland.

     A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
     of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
     it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs
     and shakes his head.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER
               And finally, Lot number 17,
               thought to be lost in the war,
               and again last night, the Da
               Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
               sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

                             HAWK
                       (re: Auctioneer)
               Is looking like a constipated
               warthog a prerequisite to getting
               a job in the art world?

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               There have naturally been questions
               of its authenticity, so to verify
               we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
               Vatican.  Doc?

                             ANNA
                       (rising, to Hawk)
               Some of us warthogs are more
               constipated than others.

     Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of
     distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation.

                             HAWK
               Oh, the shit is going to hit the
               fa--

                             ANNA
                       (suddenly serene)
               Fantastic.  Perfection.  The
               Vatican extends its jealousy to
               the lucky bidder.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               We'll begin the bidding at 82.5
               million dollars.  To you, sir.
               Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,
               madame--Ninety point five.....

     Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming
     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk
     floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it.

                             DARWIN MAYFLOWER
               lOO million clams, Francesco!

     The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
     MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
     appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
     fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
               Mayflower.

     Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
     Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She
     swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

     Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
     her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                             MINERVA
               Francesco, 100 million and one.

     Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.

                             DARWIN
               Outbid by my own wench, quelle
               bummere.

                             MINERVA
               Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
               million and one dollars.

     Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
     of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi-
     ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

     The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
     cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
     eyeline to Hawk.

     Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating Big Stan.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Go-ing!

     Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle.

     The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

                             ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
               Gone!

     The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

     Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

     Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
     in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

     The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

     Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

     Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

     The Gavel hits.

     Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
     podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
     battered crowd.

     Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
     position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
     rising from the ground.

     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.

     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing
     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

                             ANNA
               My God, that was bold of you,
               you didn't have to do that...

                             HAWK
               Forget about it--it was nothing--
               anybody would have done the same
               thing--It's an impulse...

                             ANNA
               No, I meant you didn't have to
               tackle me and rip my dress.  A
               polite push, perhaps?  A clear
               shout of "watch out, Anna"
               would have done nicely...

                             HAWK
               Excuse me, Milady.  I would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud, but I left my cape
               at the cleaners.

     Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                             ANNA
                       ("Hey, I was kidding")
               Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
               Why was the guard chasing you?

                             HAWK
                       (Serious answer?
                        Na-a-h?)
               Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

     Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere
     hammers him into the ground and the viewer into
     darkness.

     FADE IN:

     INT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT

     Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated
     gurney.

                             HAWK
               Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole
               cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,
               but I'll take the worst cloud you
               got...

     Hawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him.

                             CESAR
               News flash.  You're not in
               heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and
               counting, if you know what I'm
               saying.  Couldn't just play along,
               could you...

     EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT

     The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.

     INT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Antony raises up a mammoth gun.

                             HAWK
               Pretty class way of covering your
               tracks.  I think that auctioneer
               landed at La Guardia.

                             ANTONY
               Subtlety was never one of our
               strong points.

                             HAWK
               Neither's flossing.

     A confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand.
     Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby
     trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul-
     ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the
     partition.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white,
     freaks at the starred windshield.

     THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

     The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars.

     INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

     Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor
     brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward.

     OUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE

     The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

     The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking.

     A sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT
     --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney!

     Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road.

     THE GURNEY

     Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface.

     The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition.

     Hawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM.

                             HAWK
               Life don't get much better than
               this.

     He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane.

     Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran-
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     FLINGS the change from twenty feet away.

     TOLL BOOTH

     The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the
     gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm.

     EXT. THE AMBULANCE

     CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE

     Cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             CESAR
               Make him into Roadkill!

     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

                             ANTONY
               Yeah, run him down!

     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     THE AMBULANCE

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down

     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD

     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

     Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             HAWK
               This is the worst night...

                             SNICKERS
               When it rains, it pours.  Name's
               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
     the "outfit."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.
               But it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               Diseases.  You don't know what
               it's like being called Clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               Whoops, forgot....

     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the
     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop
     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               My name's Butterfinger.

                             HAWK
               No shit.

     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE
     KAPLAN.

                             KAPLAN
               Don't you just hate kids...

                             ALMOND JOY
               George, you promised.  No Old CIA/
               New CIA jokes...

                             KAPLAN
               I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks
               think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
               They think the Cold War involves
               penguins and...

                             HAWK
               Don't I know you...

                             KAPLAN
               You just might.  I'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  At
               the time, I was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and I had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               I won't be offended.

                             HAWK
               Bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     Hawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             HAWK
               But I'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             KAPLAN
               I used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               I was shredding documents in the
               basement.  Deep down, I guess I
               was just jealous.  You were one
               incredible thief...

                             HAWK
               To what do I owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.

                             KAPLAN
               I Want to make things up to you.
               That's why I got you this gig,
               doll.  Hawk, my name's George
               Kaplan and to quote the late,
               great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
               just begun."

                             HAWK
               Three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  If you think I'm doing
               another...

                             KAPLAN
               Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

                             HAWK
               Employer?  The president?

                             KAPLAN
               No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.
               what's that up there?

                             HAWK
               I'm supposed to fall for that?

                             KAPLAN
               Shucks.  Guess not.

     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
     sticker.

     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY

     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as "O
     Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             HAWK
               No.  Way.

     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler
     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome to Rome, sir.

                             HAWK
               Yes way.

     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY

     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...

     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE

     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             DARWIN
               For those kind of wages, I could
               have built the factory in America!
               They're Vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?
               I hear depressing news like this
               and I want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!
               The Hawkster!  What do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             HAWK
               You could host American Bandstand
               in here.  Why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             DARWIN
               Because I didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                             DARWIN
               What can I tell you, I'm the
               villain.  Initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, I thought
               what the heck.  Hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  I would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, I want
               to be in business with you.

     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER

     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             HAWK
               My life is not some deal.  I...

                             ALFRED (O.S.)
               It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

                             DARWIN
               I'm sorry, I have to take this.
               Those are valid points though...

     Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
     Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             DARWIN
               You better have a good excuse...
               You better have a better excuse!
               You are so weak!  I'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle America or else my name
               would be Running Brave or Vomiting
               Antelope...Really.  Well, listen
               close, babe.

     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING
     NOISE fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             DARWIN
               Shall we?

     Darwin bolts out.  Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod
     Serling to explain things, then bolts out too.

     EXT. E.U.R. DISTRICT BUILDING--DAY

     Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  Alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             DARWIN
               So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
               words...

                             HAWK
               Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you
               own Park Place, you own the four
               railroads.  You think you're God.
               For all I know, you're probably
               right.  I just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               Nintendo after I find out what it
               is.  Man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  What am I saying, you
               did buy it...

                             DARWIN
               Oh... Let's see.  There are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "Sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the Da Vinci
               museum we're building in Vinci.
               Hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               If I seem vague, grand.  We want a
               low profile on this, that's why I
               got Kaplan and the Candy bars
               involved.  I helped George help
               the Mario Brothers and Gates help
               get you out....

                             HAWK
               If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  So boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             DARWIN
               Way to go, Alfie!  How many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   Good help's hard to find.

                             HAWK
               I guess that's a no.

     INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,
     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.

     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to Minerva.

                             DARWIN
               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     The board members go into tableau silence.  Minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...

                             DARWIN
               And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up
               for Hudson Hawk.

     The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                             MINERVA
               Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva lobs a ball in the air.  Bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees
     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     Minerva paces up upon the table.

                             DARWIN
               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             MINERVA
               That's two hundred dollars a day?
               So he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

                             HAWK
               Guess I know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             MINERVA
                       (jumping off table)
               For God's sake, chain this
               convict.

     With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             HAWK
               Alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     The Board Members politely applaud.  Alfred pulls Hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             MINERVA
               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the Codex.

                             DARWIN
               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               It's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  But now finally I got my
               new goal.  World domination.  With
               your help...Bunny....quit that!

                             MINERVA
               Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

                             HAWK
               Think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  Five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     Minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             HAWK
               Anybody have a cigarette?  But
               seriously, do me a favor and
               Concorde me back to prison.  I
               don't care anymore.  I hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             MINERVA
               You go back, you won't be alone.
               You'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  You're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "Alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               Depressing.

                             HAWK
               You wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  You have no proof.

                             DARWIN
               Ah, the magic word...

     Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     The Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             DARWIN
               It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something
               you wish never happened.  We shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               Hired the guy who did the last
               Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.
               Excellent work... whoops, damn
               Fotomat assholes...

     A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in
     Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  He clicks ahead...

     Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an
     annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

     Minerva leans over in front of him.

                             MINERVA
               Tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY

     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.

     INT. THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish Italian sunglasses.

                             HAWK
               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns
               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end
               up doing this...

     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.

     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM

     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.

     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM

     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope
     performing a Coronation.

                             HAWK
                       (half-hearted)
               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed
               into robbing the Vatican by a
               psychotic American corporation
               along with a CIA...

                             VATICAN GUARD
               "You're being".....uh, I don't,
               uh...

     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

                             HAWK
               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a
               jaywalker.

     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY

     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking
     for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                             HAWK
               Operator, I want to make a collect
               call to Alex Messina, New York....

     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.

     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM

     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the
     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze...

     THE DA VINCI CODEX

     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

     The case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

                             ANNA (V.O.)
               But it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible.

     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                             ANNA
               Tough guy.  What are you--How's
               your head.

                             HAWK
                       (vegetable)
               Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

     She laughs, going into her public voice.

                             ANNA
               As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
               has lived in the Vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more.

                             HAWK
                       (under his breath)
               That's what you theenk.

                             ANNA
               Question, sir?   His untiring pen
               predicted the airplane, the
               submarine, the bicycle, the
               helicopter, and even the tank.
         
     A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
     bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate
               Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
                       (bad ventriloquism)
               Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big
               one!  why can't we go to the Epcot
               Center!

     The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.

                             ANNA
               These more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that ....

     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
     head.

     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off.

     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and
     spanked.

                             LITTLE BRAT
               Pokey, come back!

     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                             ANNA
               Come on, this stuff will knock you
               out.  Have you ever had the feeling
               you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                             HAWK
               Never, why do you ask?

     Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
     Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
     REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come
     flying out, baffled.

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE

     Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark
     circular staircase.

                             HAWK
               Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie
               Hawkins.
               My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't
               call me Hudson, not even as a joke.
               The Nuns at St. Agnes called me
               that and they're the ones who
               helped make me what I am today.
               Not a compliment...

                             ANNA
               Sure Hudson.  Are you going to
               tell me why you did that back there
               or are you going to blame it
               on Dumbo?

                             HAWK
               Could you believe that crazy
               elephant?

     Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

     INT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY

     A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags.
     Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                             HAWK
               Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times
               Square?

                             ANNA
               Delivers up to ten at night.  The
               Pope has an obsession with his
               Easter Seals.  It's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  The
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             HAWK
               The Vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             ANNA
               Nice.  But right out of our
               brochure.

                             HAWK
               Oh, you read that.

                             ANNA
               Actually I wrote it.  It's a good
               sentence.  It can apply to people.

                             HAWK
               You're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             ANNA
               I don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               And I buy my own clothes.  My
               life's a little boring...

                             HAWK
               God, I wish I could say the same
               thing.  What about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,
               Anecdotes about famous dead
               Italians....

                             ANNA
               I'll bring my entire repertoire...

     The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down.

                             HAWK
               And I'll bring my entourage...

                             ANNA
               Secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  There's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

                             HAWK
               Said.

     Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls
     out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
     She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             ANNA
               Father, it's obvious.  He's up to
               something.

     Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             JESUS (Italian)
               Report downstairs at once.

                             ANNA
               Yes, sir.

     INT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA

     A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna
     clacks up to him.

                             CARDINAL
               Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                             ANNA
               No, your Eminence.  I think he's
               going to steal the Codex, as
               early as next week.

                             CARDINAL
               Attempt, you mean.  The vanity
               of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The
               Vatican has foiled the advances
               of Pirates and Terrorists.  We
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from New Jersey.  Must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             ANNA
               That's the best kind.  A wise
               woman once said "Polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             CARDINAL
                       (chuckling)
               Let me be the one to quote
               Scripture.  ....As an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  Just
               remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             ANNA
                       (unconvinced)
               Yeah.  The big E.

     EXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY

     The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
     off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into...

     INT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH

     Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             HAWK
               Hello, operator.  I'd like to
               make a collect call to New York
               number...

     The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious Hawk.

                             HAWK
               Thank you, operator, thank you.

     Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the
     limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                             HAWK
               Come on, Alex, pick up, you
               Reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.

     INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT

     It is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the
     bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.

     INT. PIAZZA--DAY

     Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
     Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva
     and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             HAWK
               A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

     Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda
     tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is
     dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     Hawk gives him a double take.

                             KAPLAN
               Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying
               Italy?  I always had a soft spot
               for Rome.  Did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  Communist
               politician.

                             HAWK
               Why George, you big softie...

                             KAPLAN
               God, I miss communism.  The Red
               Threat.  People were scared, the
               Agency was respected, and I got
               laid every night.

     A humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  Kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Sorry, coach...

                             KAPLAN
                       (shaking his head)
               If his father wasn't the head of
               Shit, I hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the Mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,
               it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             HAWK
               You know Kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, I'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             SNICKERS
               Good news, bud, the Mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

                             HAWK
               Tonight?  You're whacked.  The
               timing's off, I'm underequipped
               Damnit, I have a date!

     Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, Pocket
               Fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               Gee Stud, this is going to be
               some date.  No Harvey's Bristol
               Cream?

                             KAPLAN
               Snickers, make the list happen.
               Oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the Mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  I've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             HAWK
               Thanks for sharing.

                             KAPLAN
               We blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  You and your friend
               Alex would be a late afternoon
               Triscuit.

                             HAWK
               If you do anything to my friend...

                             KAPLAN
               Yeah, right.  By the way, as long
               as I'm getting things off my
               chest, I'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  Made it look like
               a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.
               Ciao.

     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves
     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             HAWK
               What did you have against Little
               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               Come back without your yuppie
               army.  I'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...Shit.!

     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.

     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but
     Butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72
               stamps!

     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.

     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK

     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     The train zips into a tunnel.

     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO
     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh
     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     A hand rips out of the huge package.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             HAWK
               "Beware the Odd Steps."

     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             HAWK
               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The
     acid sizzles.

     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on.

     THE CODEX ROOM

     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman....

     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through
     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down
     the hall.

     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM

     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.
     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.

     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors.

     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to
     be standing.

     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and
     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND
     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's
     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
     on the other side of the room.

     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one
     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard
     pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting
     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to
     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window.

     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
     landing against the antennae.

     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM

     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian
     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre
     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.

     EXT. THE ROOF

     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the
     Guard continues to bound forward.

                             HAWK
               Please God, Please God.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
     Guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             VATICAN GUARD
               The worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.

     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL

     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of
     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride.

     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.

     HAWK

     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon...

     EXT. A BUS

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
     flying off...

     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT

     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes
     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             HAWK
               I never break a date.  Scout's
               honor.

     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
     table.

                             HAWK
               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

                             WAITER
               Bellissimo, signor.

                             HAWK
               Oh, and could I have some ketchup
               with that.

     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other
     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.

     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             SNICKERS
               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
               Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,
               you gotta have French.....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread.

                             SNICKERS
               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all
               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man
               Kaplan thinks since Communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,
               Democracy isn't free elections.
               We gotta teach the world that
               Democracy is Big Tits, College
               Football on Saturdays, Eddie
               Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
               and Kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "America's
               Funniest Home Videos."

                             ALMOND JOY
               Damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...Jesus, I
               gotta get out of this job.  If
               my Mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-Apartheid movement....

                             SNICKERS
               Quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
               and in love.

     They look off to....

     HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

     Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it.

                             HAWK
               This is bueno.  They had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             ANNA
               Prison?

                             HAWK
               I was the Warden?

                             ANNA
               How long were you in?

                             HAWK
               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

                             ANNA
               Wow, you were "in the joint."
               "Doing hard time."  It's funny,
               but that excites me.  I seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             HAWK
               I seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  Check please....

                             WAITER
               Ah, anything for dessert?

                             ANNA
                       (she shoots)
               Yes.  Something to go.

                             HAWK
                       (she scores)
               I'll bring the ketchup.

       INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling
       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             ANNA
               What have you been doing?

                             HAWK
               Uh....old badminton injury.

     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             HAWK
               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

                             ANNA
                       (not stopping)
               Oh, I'm so sorry...

     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             ANNA
               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

                             HAWK
                       (softly approaching)
               Hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  I don't make
               love every ten years, I get a
               little cranky.

                             ANNA
               It's also been a long time for
               me.  I--

     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                             HAWK
               Catholic girls are scary...

                            ANNA
               Somebody robbed the Vatican.

                            HAWK
               Oh.  No.

     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.
     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She
     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             HAWK
               It's not what you think.  Okay,
               maybe it is....

                             ANNA
               You really went and did it.  With
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  Nobody
               does it better, Hudson.  You
               started the week stealing the
               Sforza and you ended it swiping
               the Codex.

                             HAWK
               Wha--

                             ANNA
               What are your plans for the
               weekend?  Hoisting away the
               Colosseum?  Tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

     EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT

     Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
     Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              SNICKERS
               What's going on in there?

                              BUTTERFINGER
               Do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               Dunkin does it better.

                              SNICKERS
               Just read, Butterfinger.

     Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               "Da Vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             ALMOND JOY
               To yourself!.....What are they
               doing?  In twenty seconds, we go
               in.

     INT. ANNA'S PLACE

     Foam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at
     it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             ANNA
               For two years, I've been tracking
               the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their
               Sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             HAWK
               Does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  Jesus, I'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....Lifted a
               piece of licorice when I was one
               and a half.  Who knew it would
               lead... They even got the CIA
               involved!

                             ANNA
               The C.I. what?  God, no...

                             HAWK
                       (raising his cup)
               Ooh, I guess I do know something
               Here's looking at you, kid...

     THE CAR OUTSIDE

     The agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Now.

     ANNA'S HOUSE

     Hawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts.

                             HAWK
               This doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             ANNA
               Oh, I must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in
     Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             ANNA
               Why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               Vatican tonight.  My people will
               not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

                             ALMOND JOY
               That's not overly possible.  He...

                             BUTTERFINGER
               But guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at Vinci....

     Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles.

     EXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
     opening Da Vinci sequence.

     INT. HELICOPTER

     Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering.

     INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

     A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     Kaplan.

     Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.

     Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she
     comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

                             KAPLAN
               Way to go, Anna.

                             ANNA
               When the Mayflowers find out we
               have the Codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             KAPLAN
                       (gung-ho lying)
               And then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... Is that it?

     Hawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.

                             ANNA
               Actually George, it's not it.
               What are we doing in this castle?
               I happen to know the Mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out Da Vinci used to
               do...

     The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da
     Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             KAPLAN
                       (trying to be solemn)
               It's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  Operation
               Deflower Mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             ANNA
                       (taking it in)
               Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is
               that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               Darwin, Minerva, and you.
               Basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             KAPLAN
               Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were
               true, Almond Joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the Codex.
               Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

     Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

                              ANNA
               Cat got his tongue?

                              KAPLAN
               Actually he never told us what it
               was.

     Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             ANNA
               How sweet.  I trust you will see
               Hudson Hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  I recommend
               leniency...

                             SNICKERS
                       (holding in a laugh)
               Oh, I think we all do.

     Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     Kit Kat.

                             SNICKERS
               Do you think she has any idea that
               Operation Deflower Mayflower is as
               bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

                             KAPLAN
               I don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             ALMOND JOY
               With all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't I cut out her
               heart?

                             KAPLAN
               Close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious Vatican organization.
               Hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
     Kat who fakes one back.

     INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             DARWIN
               Seven!

     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a
     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             ALFRED
               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

                             MINERVA
               Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  You are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             DARWIN
               Haven't you ever seen, like David
               Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             MINERVA
               Like a "cat", one could say.

                             HAWK
               Shucks, I'll just take it back.

     Hawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to
     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             MINERVA
                       (bouncing up)
               No, let me!

                             DARWIN
                       (pout)
               I don't care.

     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             HAWK
               Another piece of the puzzle for
               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     Flunkies.

                             DARWIN
               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I
               hate than failure.  All you had to
               do was follow the Hawk, it's not
               like I said "Teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             DARWIN
               I guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             DARWIN
               God Minerva, I was kidding.

     A SHOCKED HAWK

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.

     THE MAYFLOWERS

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,
     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.

                             MINERVA
               Get away from there, convict!

                             HAWK
               Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

     Snickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     Snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             DARWIN
               Don't hurt him!  We need him for
               the final job!

     Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy.

                             HAWK
               Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even
               if I do this....

     Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             HAWK
               And this....

     Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach.

                             HAWK
               Surely this must offend....

     Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the
     ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns.

                             KAPLAN
               That's it!

     Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             HAWK
               Things are getting a little loose
               at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.
               "Put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  May I call you
               Minnie....

     Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's
     crotch.  Hawk stops dancing.

                             DARWIN
               Come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             HAWK
               Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing
               like Franki Valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     Alfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs.

                             MINERVA
               Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

                             HAWK
               Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,
               I'm involved in this thing, so I
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               I wanna be treated as an adult.

                             DARWIN
               That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in
               Rome.  Now go to your room.

     Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck.  He falls.

     INT. DARK CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The lips of Anna come into light.

                             ANNA
               Forgive me Father for I have
               sinned.  It's been 1200 hours
               since my last confession.

     INT. THE CARDINAL'S SIDE OF THE CONFESSION BOOTH

     The cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             CARDINAL
               Hit me with your best shot.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An
               innocent man.  A thief.

                             CARDINAL
               Anna, what are you trying to say...

     ANNA'S DARKENED LIPS

                             ANNA
               He came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  But he knew Right and
               Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     THE CARDINAL

     freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before...

                             CARDINAL
               "Messed around" messed around?  I
               know-- I don't want to know.  First
               base?  Second Base?  Stop me when
               I'm getting warm...

                             ANNA (O.S.)
               A little petting is not the issue!

                             CARDINAL
               Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and
               five minutes outside.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFESSION BOOTH--MORNING

     The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             CARDINAL
               So let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               Mayflowers but Kaplan and the
               Candy Bars are?

     Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun.  The gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             ANNA
               You got it.  Operation Deflower
               Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the
               punchline.  I thought we were using
               the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,
               but really the CIA was using me to
               keep us away from Mayflower.

                             CARDINAL
               Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal
               in charge of catering.... If the
               Mayflowers get the three sections
               of Da Vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of
               Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             ANNA
               I'm going to find out.

                             CARDINAL
               I'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to God as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             ANNA
               I know, I know, your Eminence, just say
               "God go with me."

                             CARDINAL
               God go with you, sister.

     Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  She moves off....

     INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                             DARWIN
               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  In the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             MINERVA
               Surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             HAWK
                       ("What's my Line")
               That's two down to Kitty
               Carlisle...

     Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  He rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests Alfred.

                             MINERVA
               Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  On the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  Great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             HAWK
               Alchemy.

                             DARWIN
                       (casually goosing Alfred)
               Alchemy!  Is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  Minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  I dumped
               some lira into research... Shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
               La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  Money
               isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck
               blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!
               Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real
               deal!  Money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             MINERVA
               Market crashes.  Bomb drops.
               Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  In 1992,
               Europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  It's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             DARWIN
               Well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

                              HAWK
               Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.
               The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,
               this is all too Indiana Jones and
               the Lost City of King Tut for me,
               man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw Alex...

                             MINERVA
               Jail, you asshole!  Our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

     Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             DARWIN
               I'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  I'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the Prom!

                             HAWK
               You want an address on that last
               one?

     Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger.

                             HAWK
               Bunny, not you too?

                              MINERVA
               You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I
               think I know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing Hawk.

                              HAWK
               I'll kill all you.  Even the old
               lady.


     Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     Italian leather coat.

                             ALEX
               I hated cigarettes until I saw my
               first No Smoking sign.  Keep off
               the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.
               Only law I cared about was
               friendship.  Broke that one too,
               didn't I?  This Gates-Mario
               Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               Visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  I don't know, I thought
               you'd get into it.  It's better
               than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at
               the bar.  I didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  Them using
               me to use you... I'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

     EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

     The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
     with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
     Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
     center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the
     periphery....

                              KAPLAN
               I just don't think it was a
               smoking hot idea to leave them up
               there alone.

                             MINERVA
               Don't worry George, this is the
               reason we put the old diabetic
               guinea on the payroll to begin
               with.  To keep Hawk in line.
               They'll talk about "being buddies"
               and "chugging brewskis."

                             DARWIN
                       (raising glass)
               You gotta love male bonding.

     As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
     Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.

                              KAPLAN
               You were saying...

     Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
     holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
     continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers-
     by give them space.

                             HAWK
               You bastard!  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job!

     Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily
     raises his gun.

                             ALEX
               Hawk... I'm so sorry...

     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They
     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
     Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
     happening" catatonia.

     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
     ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                             HAWK
               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't
               go out like this.

     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
     Snickers stops.

     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds
     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
     The other two drag in Alex.

     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
     as the van pulls away.

                             MINERVA
               Plan B, anyone...

     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....

     AROUND A CORNER

     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
     way.

     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He
     hits his handle with frustration.

     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW

     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck
     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             ANNA
               Oh thank God, you're dead...

                             ALEX
               It was so beautiful!  When the
               blanks went off, they...

     Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.

                             HAWK
               You bastard.  You fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             ALEX
               But I said I was sorry....

                             HAWK
               No sweat, Alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  What
               was your per-diem?

                             ALEX
               Don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I
               made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, don't you understand...

                             HAWK
               And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
               I don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  I'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             ANNA
               I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
               I-care-for-you...

                             HAWK
               Oh.  Well, what's this?

     Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
     Museum from out of his pocket.  Anna turns white.

                             ANNA
               Where did you get this?

                             HAWK
               You know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the Codex.... the
               Mayflower Museum.

                             ANNA
               It's from the machine.  All they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  We
               can't let that happen.

                             ALEX
               You're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             ANNA
               Something like that.

                             ALEX
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I
               are going to Rio.  We're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  Right,
               buddy?...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, God's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             HAWK
               You better believe I can.  I'm
               sick of people telling me what I
               have to do.

                             ANNA
               It's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             HAWK
               Selfish attitude?  I'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             ANNA
               You re not "some guy" anymore,
               Hudson.  Right now, you're the
               only guy.  Without your help, I....

     Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.  The
     weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             HAWK
               The world is beautiful.  Every day
               in prison I made sure to remember
               that.  It's only when I actually
               got out that I forgot.  If I was
               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
               But being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  The world is
               beautiful and I'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  Alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             ANNA
               That was beautiful.

                             ALEX
               I laughed, I cried.

     Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     Alex.

                             HAWK
               Rio, Alex?  After all they've
               done to...Hey, these tickets are
               for Moscow!

                             ALEX
                       (knowing smile)
               Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin
               thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

     A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
     ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
     bullet holes.  Anna sweetly intervenes.

                             ANNA
               Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

     The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.

     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     Wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the Mayflowers and the other agents.

                             KAPLAN
               We're all family now.  My team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             SNICKERS
               We're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for American imports.

     Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             ALMOND JOY
               Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is
               located in a wing of the Kremlin
               that they used to throw the Miss
               Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             KAPLAN
               As for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...

     INT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT

     A head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer.
     Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             ALEX
               We're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             HAWK
               Geez, this Art Treasures Room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             HAWK
               Hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             ANNA
               Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit
               nervous.  I'm sorry I could only
               score clergy passports.

                             HAWK
               Fits my new image.  A thief for
               the masses.  This is one job I'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  Gum.

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     Hawk holds.

                             ALEX
               The security's actually not that
               severe.

                             ANNA
               It doesn't have to be.  Everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               Kremlin, you'll end up in a
               Siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of
     Budapest.

                             HAWK
               Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               I can't believe this is the Iron
               Curtain.  All the guy at Airport
               customs wanted to know was "Who
               Shot J.R.?"

                             ALEX
               You sound disappointed.

                             HAWK
               Yeah, I mean, come on, going
               through the Iron Curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     THE VAN

     passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance.

                             HAWK (V.O.)
               It's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....

     EXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT

     Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

                             SNICKERS
               We are the blue light.  The green
               light is where the Art Treasures
               room is.

                             KAPLAN
               Let's go make a purple light.
               Where's Kit Kat?

     EXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS

     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They
     scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.

                             ALEX
               Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

                             ANNA
               Gum.

     All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.

                             HAWK
               Count of three?

                             ALEX
               Why not just go now?

                             HAWK
               Okay.

     The Trio rush for the door.

     THE KREMLIN ROOF

     SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?

     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.  The Guard
     swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

     THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...

     INT. GRUNGY WHITE FOYER

     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.
     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael
     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE
     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the
     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush
     ahead.

     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF

     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     Snickers' apparatus rings.  Kaplan answers it.

                             KAPLAN
               Everything's going fine, Minerva,
               thanks for asking...

     INT. NONDESCRIPT HALLWAY

     Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with
     Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank.

                             MINERVA
               I say who needs this Hudson Hawk
               anyway....

     INT. A GRAND BALLROOM

     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.  Threaten-
     ing SOVIET SOLDIERS maneuver on the floor.

                             HAWK
                       (Wizard of Oz)
               Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

     They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating DARWIN AND MINERVA ENTER, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             MINERVA
               Everybody here, in Rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     The servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an M.  A GROUP
     OF SERIOUS SOVIET V.I.P.'s come out to join the
     Mayflowers at the table.

     THE ROOF

     Kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             KAPLAN
               Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat
     is.  He holds up an "About Time" card.  The agents laugh
     and greet them.

     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN
     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             ALEX
               Eighth room down, babe...

                             ANNA
               Guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             HAWK
               Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

     Our trio charges down the hallway.

                             HAWK
               "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             ALEX
               "Maybe we're ragged and funny."

     They reach a MASSIVE SPOOKY DOOR WITH AN ODD, ANCIENT
     LOCK.  They go to work on it.  Not losing the beat.

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "But we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  Side by Side..."

     INT. TOP FLOOR HALLWAY

     With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy.

                             KAPLAN
               Create a diversion.

     Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-Uzis.

     SOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing SNAP.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     Behind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED
     GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             ALEX
               Now that's a lock.

                             HAWK
               Don't worry, we'll get it...

                             ANNA
               Can I sing this time, too?
               Please?

     Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             HAWK
               Uh, I guess so.

     The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR
     tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks
     as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

                             DARWIN
               I look at you Soviet people and I
               feel... pity... superiority.  Most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that Capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a Cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             MINERVA
                       (smiling)
               We're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             DARWIN
               So let's get busy.  Have some fun
               and make some deals.

     AT THE LOCK

     Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     They are improvising...

                             HAWK
               "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             ALEX
               "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and
     Alex can barely concentrate.

                             ANNA
               "But we'll travel the road, Sharing
               the load.  Side by Side!"

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex
     are working on.

     Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             SNICKERS
               This is the room above the Art
               Treasures room.  The lock is a
               Natalya Z-Z, first created...

                             ALMOND JOY
               Snickers, baby, I love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               Silencer bomb...

     Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     BEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS

     come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting.

                             HAWK
               That was close....

                             ALEX
               Anna, I think you better stay....

                             HAWK
               You can be lookout!.....  Take
               Alex's gun.

     Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little
     Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through
     the doors.

     THE HALLWAY ABOVE

     The CIA bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL

     Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

                             ANNA
               "You can be the lookout."

     Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers
     and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     THE BALLROOM FLOOR

     A VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball
     cap, addresses Darwin.

                             SOVIET LEADER
               Before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  We--

                             DARWIN
               Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.
               Listen up, for reasons I don't want
               to get into, I recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but I'm
               going to re-build it here and
               Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     THE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             HAWK
               "We all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             ALEX
               "But we'll be the same as we started...

     The lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into...

     INT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM

     Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed,
     with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...

                             HAWK AND ALEX
               "Just traveling along, singing a
               song.  Side--"

                             HAWK
               Geez, this place is a mess...

                             ALEX
               Voila...

     They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in
     the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches
     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,
     not sings.

                             ALEX
               Side by side, man...

     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the
     Candy Bars drop down behind them.

                             ALMOND JOY
               What the hell....

                             SNICKERS
               You're supposed to be dead!

                             ALEX
               I'm a ghost.  Boo.

                             HAWK
               I don't want to sound immature,
               but we were here first...

                             KAPLAN
               I wish I could think of those cute
               quips the way you can, Hawk, but
               I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

     Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex
     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but
     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his
     back.

                             HAWK
               No....

                             ALMOND JOY
               That was pretty uncool, George...

                             KAPLAN
               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds
               me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.
               Ah, victory is so sweet....

     Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     A SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray,
     revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model.

                             MINERVA
               Yum.  This is the best meal I
               ever had...

     ANNA

     bulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's
     gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do....

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan is bugging out.

                             KAPLAN
               Damnit, this isn't the plan!
               Blue light, green light, shit!
               Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,
               see if you can find out anything.

     They thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's
     oblivious clutches, shouts..

                             HAWK
               Can't you see the Mayflowers
               double-crossed you...

                             KAPLAN
               They may be scum, but if I get the
               Da Vinci model back, then we'll be
               roasting weenies on the beach.

                             HAWK
               I don't think you'll appreciate
               their choice of weenie.

     Kaplan raises his gun.

     THE BALLROOM BANQUET

     Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises
     a glass of vodka in the other.

                             DARWIN
               You're helping us achieve a goal
               and in return, I'm giving you a
               key to the world's executive
               washroom.  Don't piss it away....
               Skoal, amigos...

                              ANNA (O.S.)
               Stop or I'll shoot.

     Minerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to
     look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun.

                              ANNA
               You people are immoral and
               narcissitic and I won't let you...

     In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table
     begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the
     railing.

     THE ART TREASURES ROOM

     Kaplan lowers his gun.

                             KAPLAN
               I can't believe this.  I'm in
               fucking Russia, or do I have to
               say, the fucking Soviet Union and
               I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.
                       (raising back up
                        his gun)
               I never thought I'd say "I'm just
               in this job for the money."  Sad.
               Any last immature quips?

                             HAWK
               No.
                       (a beat)
               But why do you let Butterfinger
               keep those blood stains on his
               shirt?

     Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger
     looks down to his shirt.

                             BUTTERFINGER
               What blood stains....

     Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger.
     Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold
     Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's
     skull.

                             HAWK
               You want immature, how 'bout an
               egg fight...

     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's
     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals
     to the ground, geysering blood.

     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.

                             HAWK
               Alex, are you....

                             ALEX
               I can't believe you didn't notice.
               My weight.  I lost ten pounds in
               Rome

                              HAWK
               You're a reed, man.  I gotta get
               Anna.  Hang in there...

     THE BALLROOM

     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.

     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-
     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight
     of Anna....

                             ALMOND JOY
               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I
               have to cut out your heart for
               real now.  It's not personal.

     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife.

                             ALMOND JOY
               You won't shoot.  I read your
               dossier... Sister.

     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The
     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.

     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone
     ballet.

                             ALMOND JOY
               I gotta get a new job...

     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of
     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,
     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-
     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success.

     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to
     her level.  She bolts off....

     BALLROOM FLOOR

     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip
     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for
     cover, firing upward.

     KIT KAT

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the M.

     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another
     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot.

     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally
     creeps behind him.

     HAWK

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     Anna is bustling.  They hug...

                             ANNA
               The Mayflowers got...

     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in
     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting
     Mayflowers halt.

     KIT KAT

     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.

     MINERVA

     breaks the standstill.

                             DARWIN
               What a pleasant surprise.  You're
               probably wondering...

                             HAWK
               But you're going to tell us
               anyway...

                             MINERVA
               I hate a man with a sense of
               humor.  While you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity, we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way: a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal.

                             HAWK
               If you think you're getting past
               me...

     Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the
     ground.

                             HAWK
               Don't be stupid...they...

                             SNICKERS
               Bastard!  If you were a true
               American.

                             HAWK
               Just shut up and hit me!

     Snickers swings a punch.  Hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest.

     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her
     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

     KIT KAT

     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs
     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.

     A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY
     HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

     Alfred discards him over the edge.

     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.

     The lone card of "FUCK" plops from his open eyed corpse.

     HAWK

     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a
     staircase.

     DARWIN

     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred
     approaches.

                             DARWIN
               Alfred, the getaway car...

     SNICKERS

     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.

                             HAWK
               Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat
               burglar!  Nobody said anything
               about this fight-to-the-death
               shit.

                             SNICKERS
               Too bad.

     Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head.

     Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of
     the stairs, holding the strange rifle.

     Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They
     start to trot off...

                             MINERVA
               I knew it!  I told you it was a
               fake.

                             DARWIN
               That New-York-Italian-Father-
               made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-
               of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A
               million?

                             MINERVA
               Million five, lover...

     HAWK

     boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.

     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.

                             SNICKERS
               Help me you Democratic Reform
               lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you
               Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!
               Oh God, I always wanted to know
               how to play the harp, there
               just was so little time!  Rosebud!

     The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears.
     Nothing happens.

                             SNICKERS
               Maybe it was just a....

     Snickers blows up gloriously before the M.

     THE STAIRCASE

     Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps.

                             ALEX
               Get 'em.  They went down the
               hallway.

                             HAWK
               Let's just forget it, I mean...

                             ALEX
               Get em....

     Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance
     to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past
     a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward.

     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY

     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-
     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin
     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.

     THE BALLROOM

     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.

                             MINERVA
               Alex.  How's it going?

                             ALEX
               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.

                             MINERVA
               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,
               Bon Appetite.

     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth.

     THE HALLWAY

     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives
     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk
     kicks him off...

                             HAWK
               Oh, come on....

     THE BALLROOM

     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.

                             MINERVA
               Very good, Alex, but you re
               still alive....

     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last
     burst of strength, punches her across the face.

                             MINERVA
               That's fair.

     THE LONG HALLWAY

     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.

                             HAWK
               Why does this have to be so hard...

                             KAPLAN
               Tell me about it...

     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness.

     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-
     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with
     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.

     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into
     Kaplan's hands.

                             HAWK
               Take this to Hell with you...

     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.

     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine.

                             KAPLAN
               My pension.....

     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.

     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield.

     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.

     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.

     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into....

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE

     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The
     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's
     gun goes off..

     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing
     down on the accelerator.

     THE LIMOUSINE

     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors.

     THE BACKSEAT

     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.

     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE

     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall.

     INT. BACKSEAT

     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.
     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.

     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.
     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.

                             DARWIN
               God-damnit, I only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image.
               I'm a regular Joe...

     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning
     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind.

     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.

     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....

                             DARWIN
               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,
               let's talk abut this.

     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's
     body connects with the mural.

     INSIDE THE LIMO

     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the
     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan
     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.

                             HAWK
               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value...

     THE BALLROOM

     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has
     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.

                             HAWK
               Oh, honey....

     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way
     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.

                             HAWK
               We did it man, we...

     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written
     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.

     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind
     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back
     to the ground.

     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,
     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,
     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.

     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene.

     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY

     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.

     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A
     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson...

                             HAWK
               I told you not to call me Hudson.
               The only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             ANNA
               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the
               Catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             HAWK
                       (cut-off laugh)
               This is too bad to be false.

     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             ALFRED
               Welcome back to Vinci.

                             HAWK
               Last rites, sister?

                             ANNA
               Please, no nun jokes...They're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              HAWK
               She killed Alex.

     Alfred gives them a push.

     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball
     machine.

     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY

     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da
     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              MINERVA (O.S.)
               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              MINERVA
               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  Anna.....

     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              MINERVA
               I want you to monitor the Da
               Vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that Darwin and
               I's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               Beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               Alfie and I were up all night with
               the thing.

     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the
     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              HAWK
               You killed a friend.  Why should I
               help you go for the gold?

                              MINERVA
               It'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but I'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               Brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-
               crash.  Financial Empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              HAWK
               Except yours-yours.  The goal of
               world domination.  Well, if you
               put it that way, Minnie.  How can
               I resist?

                              MINERVA
               You can't, convict!  You're just
               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  It rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "How could this
               happen to me?"  It's a natural
               inclination.  But for I, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               You are on my planet!  You walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  The lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              ANNA
               Do it.  There's no reason to fight
               anymore.  She's a force of nature.

     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              MINERVA
               If you pull this off, I can't
               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,
               who we trying to kid?  But I will
               spare the Flying Nun here....

                              HAWK
               And to think I thought you were
               Evil Incarnate in pumps.

                              MINERVA
               I killed some lovable working
               class Italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  So don't play with
               me.

     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed
     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              HAWK
               Okay, fine!

     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He
     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them
     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.
     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,
               team, go!

     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da
     Vinci had it in his machine.

     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              HAWK
               I hope you know what....

                              ANNA
               Trust Leonardo....

                              HAWK
               Wha.....

     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              MINERVA
                       (into the headset)
               We're for real.

     THE MACHINE

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  The arms click higher.

     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     ANNA

     murmurs to Hawk.

                              ANNA
               Da Vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that I decoded.
               The way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  Isn't it
               wonderful?

                              HAWK
               Yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              ANNA
               Wha -- you don't want to know...

     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              HAWK
               I wanna know...

                              ANNA
               Holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               Da Vinci would be proud of you.

     IN THE MACHINE

     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     EVERYONE

     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.

     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     THE MACHINE

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE

     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,
     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.

     THE MACHINE

     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     MINERVA

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              MINERVA
               Eureka, motherfuckers!

     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.

                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)
               Minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     HAWK AND ANNA

     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on
     head-set.

                              HAWK
               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna
               say you got the Midas touch, baby...

     MACHINE

     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.

     HAWK AND ANNA

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
     on his chest, ALFRED!

                              ALFRED
               How.

                              HAWK
               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss
               is dead.  Her plan is over.

                              ALFRED
                       (strange voiced)
               My plan is just beginning.  I'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but I'm afraid
               the birth of the new British
               Empire can have no witnesses!

                              HAWK
               Ooh-kay...

     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him
     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...

     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              ANNA
               Sorry!

     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.

                              HAWK
               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not
               kill!

     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick
     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
     throat.

     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which
     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the
     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "V" hits it--

                              HAWK
               Don't lose your head over this.

     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth
     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and
     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,
     HIGH IN THE AIR.

     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.

     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's
     head).

                              HAWK
               Excuse my crass American humor.

     The machine thunders with another explosion.

     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP

     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...

                              ANNA
               Allow me.

     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              HAWK
               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     Hawk slams down on the gadget.

     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.

     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.

     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.

     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE

     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE
     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.

     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
     to the ground.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY

     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....

     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.

     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
     through the glorious vista.

     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE

     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     Unforgettable Juggler.

                             JUGGLER
                         Che pazzo....

     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
     laugh again.

     A SMALL PIAZZA

     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
     atop it.

     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             HAWK
               Have I ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               I'd really like to play
               Nintendo with you, or something...

                             ANNA
               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
               with God.
                       (smiling)
               But you're a close second, tough
               guy.  What is that smile?

                             HAWK
                       (broadly grinning)
               I got my planet back.

     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             HAWK
               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.

                                                FADE OUT.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 

          JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling
          along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't
          hide her natural beauty and panache.
          She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens
          the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other
          bags.

          She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that
          the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and
          personal affects.

          Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al

          Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment
          to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her
          mind.

          After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks
          at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and
          then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.
          B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl
          The SUV drives off down the city street.

          C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1 

          The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in
          the background, growing more distant by the second.

          2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2 

          The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through
          a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and
          absolutely breathtaking.

                         GPS SYSTEM
          Turn right up ahead.


          Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are
          all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 2.

          Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house.
          She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks
          the address on the house, and gets out of the car.

          3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3

          Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the
          screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN.
          The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?

          Jennifer cautiously steps inside.

          4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4

          The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds
          hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution.
          Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in
          various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube
          TVs with their plastic casings cracked.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?

          Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hello?

          EARL (O.S.)
          I'm a coming, I'm a coming.

          From out of the back walks the proprietor, EARL (late-50's),
          takes a double take at Jennifer, surely the prettiest thing
          he's seen in a long while. He sees her standing in the
          middle of the mess, suddenly aware of it. He bends down to
          pick something up in a futile attempt to clean.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Sorry about the mess.

                         JENNIFER
          It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer
          Hills. We spoke last week.

                         (NO RECOGNITION)
          I'm the one who's renting the cabin
          on...

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          (Jennifer holds a piece of paper)
          .on Mockingbird Trail.

          Earl's surprised.

                         EARL
          Oh, you're Miss Hills.

          Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small
          drawer and takes out a key.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Don't suppose you know how to get
          out there?

                         JENNIFER
          Afraid not.

          Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn
          arrows already on it.

                         EARL
          Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit
          tricky.

                         (BEAT)
          These here arrows will get you
          through town. Over here, it's more
          dirt road and woods so it can get
          kind of dicey. We're a tad short
          on street signs.

                         JENNIFER
          Well if I get lost I'll just ask
          for directions.

                         EARL
          To who? Lady, the cabin is a real
          beaut, but heck if there ain't
          nothin' out there for a good
          country mile.

                         JENNIFER

                         (JOKING)
          Well, I guess I don't have to worry
          about bothering the neighbors.

                         EARL
          Not planning on throwing a party,
          are ya? The security deposit...

                         JENNIFER
          No, no. I'm looking forward to the
          peace and quiet. I'm a novelist.
          I'm starting my next book.

          Earl just looks at her.

                         EARL
          Alright, well, if that's what
          you're aimin' for, just follow that
          there map.

          Jennifer looks at the map.

          5 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 5

          Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by
          two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map.
          Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a
          single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump.

          EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6 

          Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map
          as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the
          pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own.

          Jennifer spins around. 

          Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from
          Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.

                         JOHNNY
          Didn't mean to frighten you.

          Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy,
          but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure.

                         JENNIFER
          No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost
          anyway. Looking for Mockingbird
          Trail?

                         JOHNNY
          You are definitely lost. 

                         JENNIFER
          Really? I thought--

                         JOHNNY
          Nah, you sure missed it. It's a 
          good ten miles back, left turn 
          after the big red mailbox.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4A.

                         JENNIFER
          Oh, okay, I think I saw that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5.
          Johnny flashes his smile, picking his teeth with a toothpick.
          Jennifer stands there uncomfortably.

                         JOHNNY
          You, uh... staying at the cabin?

          Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her
          mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the
          silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage.

          In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the
          fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his
          lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that
          look like they could bend steel.

          STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind
          Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of
          pork rinds.

                         STANLEY 
          Howdy ma'am. 

          He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp. 

                         ANDY
          I'd sop that up with a biscuit real
          good.

          Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny,
          who is still awaiting her answer.

                         JENNIFER
          Uh... no. I mean yes.

          As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down.
          She is definitely something to look at.

          Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to
          the guys, then back to her.

                         JOHNNY
          You know, you're running a little
          hot. Want me to uh... maybe I
          should check under your hood?

          Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded.

                         JENNIFER
          How's that line working for you?

          The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands
          there looking at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5A.

                         JOHNNY
          I don't know, how's it working for
          you?

          Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner,
          pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery.
          Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to
          the pump again. $19.78.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6.

                         JENNIFER
          Let me just...

          Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her
          hands.

                         JOHNNY
          I'll get that.

                         JENNIFER
          No I got it--

          Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door
          of the car when--
          HONK -- HONK -- HONK - The SUV's deafening alarm blares out.
          Johnny's startled, stumbles backwards, trips and goes
          sprawling to the ground.

          Jennifer, controlling laughter, holds up her keys and clicks
          the alarm off.

          Johnny is covered in dust and oil, struggling to get to his
          feet while maintaining a shred of dignity. Jennifer
          chuckles.


                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Sorry. I accidentally hit the
          panic button. Are you okay?

                         JOHNNY
          I'm fine.

          Johnny looks away, angry. He's certainly not the type of guy
          who can laugh at himself easily, if at all. From the garage,
          Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw.

                         ANDY
          (from the garage)
          Hey! You better check your
          underwear, Johnny.

          Stanley smiles and elbows Andy, but his mouth is too full
          with pork rinds to actually laugh.

                         STANLEY
          Yea... Check um' for skidmarks...
          Johnny shoots him a harsh look. 

          Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty. Trying to contain her
          laughter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6A.

                         JENNIFER
          Sure you okay?

          Johnny's eyes are cold, his face red.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 7.

                         JOHNNY
          I said I was fine.

          Suddenly, Jennifer grows uneasy. She smiles uncomfortably,
          gets in the car and drives away.

          Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow.
          He watches Jennifer's car disappear and spits on the ground
          as the laughter escalates in her absence. Johnny spins.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          What the hell are you two dipshits
          laughing at?!

          7 EXT. CABIN - DAY 7

          Jennifer arrives at the cabin. She gets out of her car and
          stands there, looking up at it. In slight disrepair and in
          need of a paint job but the quaint charm makes you quickly
          forget its shortcomings.

          8 TNT. CABIN - DAY 8 

           Jennifer walks in with her bags, looks around the cabin.
           It's rustic, but she's hardly roughing it.

          9 INT. CABIN, THE KITCHEN - DAY 9 

           She starts unpacking. A few cardboard boxes with non-
          perishable food items sit on the counter next to cases of
          bottled water. Also, there's a large wine case with
          different liquor bottles in the sections. Jennifer takes out
          a bottle of top shelf vodka and puts it in the freezer.
          Then she begins to grab the wine bottles, taking an extra
          second to look at one, the hell with it, she grabs an opener.

          A9 TNT. CABIN - DAY A9 
          Jennifer sets up her laptop at a make-shift workstation.
          Throws some freshly cut flowers in a small vase, a few lucky
          figurines from her travels... it all feels very ritualistic.

          10 EXT. CABIN - DAY 10 

          Jennifer site at the end of the boat dock. Laptop and glass
          of wine writing away. She couldn't be more content.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8.
          She takes a deep, replenishing breath, and then goes back to

                         WRITING--

          A10 INT. CABIN - DAY A10

          CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a
          furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away.
          Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a
          writer's high if you will.
          Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then 
          she hears a sound off in the trees. 
          She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a 
          harmonica. Then a few even more distant "heeeeeeweeeee". 
          After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some 
          boys off in the distance having a party or something. 
          Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass
          of wine.

          11 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11 

          Jennifer sits at the table, her laptop propped open in front
          of her. She's talking away on the phone as she stops for a
          moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine.

                         JENNIFER

                         (INTO PHONE)
          .Lonely? Are you kidding? I
          should've come out here on my first
          book...
          The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed
          shut. It startles jennifer. She looks in the direction of the
          sound.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Sorry, something just...
          Another slam, and again.

          Jennifer sets down her lap top and puts the glass of wine on
          the arm of the chair. She gets up and looks off into the
          dusky woods. Then back to the house.
          A light breeze kicks up and SLAM. Again.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 9.
          Jennifer snaps the phone shut, and walks down the steps of
          the front porch.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hello?
          In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as
          night encroaches.
          Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see a

          SHED. SLAM!
          The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze.
          She makes her way towards the shed.
          All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All
          Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps
          inside.

          B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11

          Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots,
          garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug
          of LYE.
          Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the
          shed. She moves in further as--

          SLAM!
          The door shuts behind her -

                         JENNIFER
          Shit!

          C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11

          Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a
          beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more
          than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the
          cabin.

          D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12 

          Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and
          then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off
          the arm of the chair into her lap.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 10.

                         JENNIFER
          Ohhhhh... You gotta be kidding.
          She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and
          picks up her things to heads in the cabin.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Way to go Jennifer...
          The last of the days light is disappearing.

          12 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 12

          Jennifer stands at the sink, in panties and tank top - pre-
          soaking her sweater and pants.

          13 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 13 


          POV THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW:
          Jennifer continues at the sink, her beautiful, partially nude
          body is framed perfectly in the window for all to see... but
          no one's around for miles...

          14 EXT. WOODS - DAY 14 

          Jennifer jogs through the trees. She wears a tight pair of
          running shorts and a out off T-shirt.
          Jennifer stops in a small clearing. With her hands on her
          knees, she struggles to catch her breath.
          She stands and walks in a circle, looks around. Checks her
          watch.
          Then notices something in the distance hidden behind the
          trees.
          ANGLE ON: A dilapidated shack, rotted from decay and neglect.
          Jennifer's curiosity gets the best of her.

          15 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 15 

          She walks up to the shack, looks around. She then enters
          through what is left of the front door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 11.

          A15 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY A15

          The place hasn't been occupied in quite a while, but it was
          once. An old, dirty mattress in the corner... a sawhorse-for-
          a-counter with old cans and bottles... even a rusty old
          garden tool or two.
          Near the window she sees an old, mold covered BIBLE propped
          open.
          Jennifer suddenly gets the chills, she shakes it off and then
          gets the hell out of there.

          16 EXT. CABIN - DAY 16

           Jennifer finishes her jog and returns to the cabin, leans 
           over on the porch and catches her breath. 

          17 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 17 

          Jennifer stands in front of the mirror. She looks at her
          reflection and pulls out the band that was holding up her
          ponytail. Her sweat-soaked hair falls across her shoulders.
          She turns on the faucet and is met with a dirty spray.

                         JENNIFER
          Eww!
          The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out.
          However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts
          the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and
          then disappears down the drain.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (SHUDDERS)
          Gross.
          Again, Jennifer tries the sink, but now nothing comes out.

          18 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 18

          Jennifer picks up her cellphone from the counter. She takes
          a small piece of paper out of her purse and punches in some
          numbers on the cell. After a few rings, voicemail picks up.

          about buying or selling an exotic
          animal, please leave your name --
          Jennifer snaps the phone shut in frustration, when her eye
          catches the water-damaged remnants of a service sticker
          hanging to the refrigerator door.
          Amazingly, the phone number is still visible. She shrugs to
          herself and dials the number.

          19 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM -- DAY 19

          She lifts the lid and looks inside - dry - and flushes a few
          more times to no avail - then dirty water begins to gurgle
          up.

                         JENNIFER

                         (LISTENS INTENTLY)
          No, it won't flush... I did that
          already... yes... look, I'm really
          in a spot... okay... thank you...
          I'm not going anywhere.
          As Jennifer snaps her phone shut, the handset gets caught on
          her chin, and tumbles into the toilet. PLOP!

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!
          Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes
          it out. She shakes it off vigorously.

          20 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 20 

          Jennifer stands next to the kitchen counter. She holds her
          hair dryer which is going at full blast. Her cell phone is
          propped open on the counter in front of her. She's doing her
          best to dry it out.
          Suddenly, a hand reaches out and taps her on the shoulder.
          Jennifer SCREAMS and spins around, turning the hair dryer on
          her assailant.
          An equally frightened MATTHEW throws his hands up in front of
          his face and SCREAMS just as loudly. He has several think
          colored rubber bands on his wrist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 12A.

                         MATTHEW
          P1... please! I... I came to fix
          the plumbing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 13.
          Jennifer turns off the hair dryer.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          I... I was knocking on the d...door
          a...a... while.
          Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief, especially after she gets
          a look at Matthew. He's in his mid-30's, but could pass for
          a good ten years younger. Awkward and shy, he can barely
          make eye contact with her.

                         JENNIFER

                         (FRIENDLY)
          I think you may have taken a few 
          years off my life. 
          Matthew doesn't get the joke.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Uh... thanks for coming on such
          short notice.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          You need to see the bathroom,
          right?

          21 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 21

          Matthew works away underneath the sink. Jennifer watches him
          from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed, trying to
          make small talk.

                         JENNIFER
          Is this gonna take much longer?

                         MATTHEW
          (muffled, under the sink)
          N...not much.

                         JENNIFER
          So what's wrong with it?

                         MATTHEW
          Uh... it's just older pipes.
          Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable
          with the conversation.

                         JENNIFER
          So do you live around here?

                         MATTHEW
          No...no one lives around here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 14.

                         JENNIFER
          Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant
          in town?
          Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously
          at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.

                         MATTHEW
          My... my whole life...
          Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red.
          Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of
          cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on
          the shower to the same result.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          All fixed.
          Jennifer squeals with excitement. She wraps her arms around
          Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek.

                         JENNIFER
          Thank you!
          Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs
          up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I just... you saved me
          from having to bathe in the pond. 
          Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the
          cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hey. Hey! I didn't even pay you!
          But Matthew is long gone.

          22 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 22


          ON MINIDV CAN LCD
          A wooden bat crashes down on a fish. It goes still.
          Stanley takes a MINIDV CAMCORDER away from his eye. He looks
          at Andy who's holding the bloody bat, and takes a large gulp
          from his beer, then--

                         STANLEY
          Ground rule double.

                         ANDY

                         (ANGRILY)
          A double! Look at its head. I
          knocked the eye clear out.
          Andy has, in fact, knocked the fish's eye clear out. It lays
          next to the creature, all weird and googly-looking.

                         STANLEY
          Fine. Maybe a triple. But that's
          it. You got to knock the guts out
          its mouth to score a run.

                         ANDY
          Would you turn that thing off?
          Gonna get us in trouble with that
          human society.

                         JOHNNY
          Humane you dipshit.
          Johnny site in a chair holding his fishing rod between his
          knees. A cigarette dangles from his mouth and a beer is
          perpetually glued to his hand.

                         ANDY
          Whatever.

                         STANLEY
          I told you. This thing is going to
          make me a fortune. All you got to
          do is film something crazy, then
          you send it into the internet, make
          a killing.

                         ANDY
          No one's gonna pay you for that
          crap.

                         STANLEY
          It's the hits, Andy. You just
          gotta get the hits.

                         JOHNNY
          Hits my ass, now you two retards
          gonna fish or what?
          Matthew comes crashing out of the foliage, knocks over the
          cooler spilling ice and beer all over.

                         ANDY
          Speaking of retards.

                         MATTHEW
          Q..Quit it Andy.

                         JOHNNY
          Alright. Now we're all here,
          what's the big show, Stanley?

                         STANELY
          The big show is this--
          Stanley holds up the video camera like a trophy.

                         ANDY
          Are you kidding me? That shit?
          What'd you do? Film yourself
          lighting a fart?

                         STANELY
          Better.
          Johnny just shakes his head.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          I don't know why I bother.

                         STANLEY
          I got Matthew's girlfriend in a
          private moment. 

                         ANDY
          What do you mean like on the toilet 
          or something? 
          Stanley pulls a tape out of his pocket and loads it.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew hasn't had a girl since he
          was sucking his mama's titties.

                         STANLEY
          Not true, my friends. And the
          evidence is right here.

                         MATTHEW
          What are you ta... talking 'bout
          Stanley?

                         ANDY
          Yeah, what are you talking about?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 16A.

                         STANLEY
          He had that babe from the city all
          alone and he didn't even try to
          nail her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 17.
          This gets Johnny's attention. Matthew is snapping on of the
          rubber bands. It's a bit loud. Johnny looks to him as if it
          is annoying him.

                         JOHNNY
          What babe from the city?

                         STANLEY
          You know, the one who stopped for
          gas the other day. The one who
          dumped you on your can. She had
          Matty here fixing her pipes.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit.
          Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to
          him.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Cut that shit homo! How many times
          I gotta tell you.
          Stanley gets the camera ready.

                         STANLEY
          She even gave him a kiss for
          "servicing her." Look, here's
          Matthew running from the cabin like
          a schoolgirl.
          They all gather around.
          POV CAMERA: Matthew runs from the cabin, dropping tools as
          he goes. Jennifer stands in the doorway calling after him.
          The camera goes closer on Jennifer --
          The guys break up. Johnny is a bit more serious.

                         ANDY
          Now that's some fine camera work,
          even better than the time you
          filmed yo' self hangin' your nana's
          cat.

                         JOHNNY
          What's this about a kiss? 

                         STANLEY
          Matthew here says she gave him a
          kiss right on the cheek.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit.

                         MATTHEW
          No, she did Johnny. She kissed me.

                         JOHNNY
          Don't lie to me dipshit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18.

                         STANELY
          If you all don't shut the hell up
          you'll miss the encore.
          All eyes turn to Stanley as Stanley pushes some buttons on
          the MINIDV cam. Andy comes over and looks at the LCD screen.

                         STANLEY
          Get ready for it.
          ON MINIDV: The footage that Stanley shot is obviously the
          previous night through Jennifer's kitchen window.

                         ANDY
          I'll be. Look at the rack on that
          pony.
          Andy punches Stanley in the arm. Johnny just stares at the
          screen.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          You dirty dog. Where the hell'd
          you get that?

                         STANLEY
          I've been working nights.

                         ANDY
          Sure is something to look at.
          Matthew is clearly uncomfortable, but he desperately needs to
          be one of the guys.

                         MATTHEW
          Yeah, and she likes me... she was
          nice to me.
          Stretching a rubber band.

                         ANDY
          Nice? To her, you're nothing but a
          shitter fixer. Hell, she wouldn't
          even give Johnny the time of day.
          Johnny snaps his head up and looks at Stanley.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit. I could tame that ass if
          I wanted to.

                         ANDY
          You saw her Johnny... stuck up city
          bitch. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18A.

                         STANLEY
          Yea, girls like that think you're
          hardly good enough to pump their
          gas.
          Johnny lights up another cigarette. He points at Andy. 

                          

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 19.

                         JOHNNY
          Let me tell you something. I had
          her creaming in her panties.

                         ANDY
          And she had you shitting yours.
          Least her car alarm did.
          The guys yuck it up.

                         JOHNNY

                         (SEETHING)
          You don't think I could have her
          anytime I want?
          Andy looks away and begins to reel in his line. Stanley
          stuffs his face with some crap so he doesn't have to answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Bitch like that comes up here for
          one reason. Sitting in that
          window, tits flapping in the wind
          for all to see. You know?

                         MATTHEW
          Nah... She's not like that, Johnny.
          Johnny snorts, condescendingly.

                         JOHNNY
          How do you know, ya fuckin' virgin?
          Let me tell you something. They're
          all like that! Fucking big city
          cock-teasing whore is all she is.
          He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then
          he gets right up in Matthew's face.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          You'd have no idea what to do with
          a piece of ass like that. But
          luckily I'm your friend.
          Johnny hands him a beer and pats him on the back firmly.

          23 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 23

          Jennifer writes away at the dining room table. She's on a
          tear. A "writer's zone" where everything she types is gold.
          She hits the "return" key hard, as if to punctuate a
          particularly good sentence. She picks up some lip gloss and
          puts it on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 20.
          She leans back to take a break when her eye catches the cell
          phone sitting on the table. She picks the phone up, flips it
          open - It's still completely dead.
          In frustration, she throws the phone across the room. It
          hits the couch right next to the duffle bag. She smiles
          mischievously to herself.
          Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled
          with pot and rolling papers. She expertly rolls herself a
          joint and lights it up. She closes her eyes. Bliss.

          24 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT -- LATER 24

          From a distance, the cabin looks like a star twinkling in the
          night sky. Trees sway in the breeze, dappling the light.

          25 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 25

          Jennifer's head is slouched over her desk. She passed out.
          Suddenly, A SCRATCHING NOISE at the front door.
          CLOSE ON: Jennifer's eyes flit open as -
          Jennifer jumps awake and walks over to check the door,
          glancing at the clock as she goes. 4:14 am.
          Jennifer gets to the door and listens, Nothing. She tries
          to look out... nothing.
          She turns to walk back when the scratching returns -
          Jennifer takes a few steps back toward the door. Again, the
          noise stops.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?
          Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the
          glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted.
          Jennifer opens the door slowly.

          26 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 26

          Jennifer looks outside but nothing is there. Just a gentle
          breeze and the sway of the trees. Satisfied, she walks out
          onto the front porch, then down the steps. She hugs herself
          and shivers, then she returns inside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 21.

          27 INT. CABIN, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 27

          Jennifer shuts the front door and locks it. Then she yanks
          on the door, just to make sure.

          28 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 28

          She walks back in grabbing her glass and bottle when --

          29 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 29

          The SCRAPING sound again, but this time, from UPSTAIRS.
          Jennifer looks up, hoping that she imagined it. But there it
          is again. She sets the bottle and glass down on the end table
          next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her purse
          on the couch.

          30 INT. CABIN, STAIRCASE - NIGHT 30 

          She walks slowly, holding the mace directly in front of her.
          Eventually, Jennifer gets to the top of the stairs.
          At the far end of the hallway is an open window. A branch
          from outside scrapes against the windowsill.
          Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief. She closes the window
          and heads back downstairs.

          31 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - NIGHT 31 

          She puts the mace back in her purse, and then picks up her
          drink walking to the kitchen when--
          BANG! Something smashes into the sliding glass door--
          Jennifer SCREAMS dropping the glass. It SHATTERS.
          With more than a hint of trepidation, Jennifer heads towards

          THE SIDE DOOR.
          With all the courage she can muster up, Jennifer unlocks the
          door and steps outside.

          32 EXT. CABIN, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 32

          The side porch light acts as a spotlight, illuminating the
          culprit -- a lone bird lies motionless on the ground.
          Jennifer bends down and picks up a small branch from the
          porch. She gives the bird a small poke... nothing. But her
          uneasiness is growing. Suddenly... SLAM!
          She jumps and looks to the shed, the door is open again and
          swinging. She looks to it thinking, "I shut that already..."
          She moves off the porch and toward the shed.

          33 EXT. CABIN, SHED - NIGHT 33

          Jennifer walks to the shed, it feels longer in the dark. She
          looks around to the tree line, could be something out there,
          an animal, who knows.
          She reaches the shed and shuts the door again. She searches
          the ground and sees a large stone.
          She picks up the stone and shoves it against the door.
          Satisfied, she heads back.

          34 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 34

          Jennifer immediately goes over to her table where the laptop
          is set up. She shuffles some papers around when-
          Something on her laptop screen catches her attention. She
          leans forward, brow furrowed.
          ON LAPTOP SCREEN: A picture of Johnny, Stanley, and Andy
          leering into the laptop's camera. Like a nightmarish photo
          booth snapshot.

                         JOHNNY
          Nice shot huh?
          Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find --
          Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He
          smiles.
          Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room.
          Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 22A.
          But Stanley has slipped in through the back door, video
          camera obnoxiously filming the scene (which will be out to
          throughout).

                         STANLEY
          Smile real pretty for the camera.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 23.

                         JENNIFER
          (her voice cracking)
          Get out of here. Get out of here
          right now!

                         JOHNNY
          Now that's not very hospitable, is
          it?
          Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks
          down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched
          to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The
          guys get a good laugh at Andy.

                         JENNIFER
          All of you better get out of here.
          I called the police.
          Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking.

                         JOHNNY
          You called the police? Or you will
          call the police?

                         JENNIFER
          I... I called them already.
          They're on their way right now!

                         JOHNNY
          With what phone? Matthew said you
          dropped it in the drink.
          Jennifer doesn't answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          (looks at Stanley)
          Speaking of.. .where the hell is he?
          Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door.

                         STANLEY
          Matthew, get your boney ass in
          here!
          Shortly after, Matthew shuffles inside. He can't even bring
          himself to look at Jennifer.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          Matthew here said you didn't pay
          him for fixity' your sink?

                         JENNIFER
          That is just not true! I tried to.
          He ran out... (to Matthew) Is that
          what you said?
          Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist.
          as Jennifer walks over to her purse.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'll take care of it--
          Johnny cuts her off.

                         JOHNNY
          --Let's not worry about that right
          now.
          Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with
          his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Now what's a pretty little thing
          like you doing out here all alone?

                         JENNIFER
          I'm writing. I'm a Writer... But
          my boyfriend is coming up. He'll
          actually be here any minute--

                         JOHNNY
          That right?
          The guys give a good chuckle-

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Well, I didn't realize you had a
          boyfriend coming down. We'd better
          get on outta here. Don't want to
          ruin date night.

                         STANLEY
          Yeah, yeah. Date night.

                         ANDY

                         (CHUCKLING)
          Date night...

                         JOHNNY
          You know what I think. I think
          you're lying. There's no
          boyfriend. No man in his right
          mind would leave a girl like you
          all up here on your own.

                         JENNIFER

                         (EMPHATIC)
          No he's coming. He had to work. I
          told you he'll be here soon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 25.
          Johnny turns to her.

                         JOHNNY
          Yeah, well so will Santi Clause.
          Andy and Stanley are loving every minute of this. Matthew
          leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Come here. Have a drink with me.

                         JENNIFER
          No, look. I have the money--
          Andy slingshots the thong right at Jennifer. It lands at her
          feet.

                         JOHNNY
          What's a matter? Too good to drink
          with us?

                         JENNIFER
          Please, I don't want to.
          Johnny raises his eyebrows. The bottle is partially empty.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          Uh, what's this? It's already been
          opened.

                         (TO OTHERS)
          See, she don't want to drink with
          us. What are we, dirt?

                         JENNIFER
          I didn't say that.
          Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the
          screen, begins reading aloud from the text...

                         ANDY

                         (READING)
          .No one wants a phone call at 2
          o'clock in the morning. When
          you're fifteen it's a prank call,
          when your twenty it's a drunk
          boyfriend call, but after twenty
          five, it's usually real bad news.
          That's how I found out my father
          died...

                         (THEN)
          Whose daddy died?

                         JENNIFER
          Can you all please leave me alone?!
          Meanwhile, Stanley putters around the kitchen, opening and
          closing the cabinet doors, knocking stuff around. He finds a
          pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces,
          spits it out.

                         STANLEY
          Damned cardboard. You eat this
          shit?

                         ANDY
          You should! Do you some good.
          Andy turns from the desk, strikes a match and flicks it at
          Jennifer,

                         JENNIFER
          Look, can you just tell me what you
          want? What do you want? I offered
          you money.
          Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy
          giggles. He finds this quite funny.

                         JOHNNY

                         (EXTENDING BOTTLE)
          Here.

                         JENNIFER
          Fine, if you'll leave I'll take a
          drink.
          Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it. Drinks a
          small sip. They all start booing.

                         JOHNNY
          Come on. You can do better than
          that. I bet when you're out there
          with your city friends you can throw
          'em back with the best of them.

                         JENNIFER
          I took the drink, now you--

                         JOHNNY
          I said drink it!
          Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a
          nice swig. Then chokes and gags. They all cheer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          See? Now was that so bad?
          Johnny takes the bottle back and takes a swig himself.

                         JENNIFER
          Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed
          you the other day, but we're even
          now, right? Okay. Please. Leave.
          Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop
          their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table.

                         JOHNNY
          Oh... that's not what this is
          about.

                         JENNIFER
          Then what is this about?
          Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of
          Jennifer, towering over her.

                         JOHNNY
          I want to see your teeth.
          As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at
          him, not even sure she heard him correctly.
          Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far
          corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall.

                         JENNIFER
          Wha... what?

                         JOHNNY
          You heard me, show Horse. Show me
          your teeth.

                         JENNIFER
          That's... I'm not going to...
          please leave.

                         JOHNNY
          (quiet, but firm)
          Show the teeth...
          Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he used
          to kill the fish. Johnny smacks it against his palm.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          .or lose the teeth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27A.
          Andy walks back to the couch and flicks another match at
          Jennifer. She recoils with fear as she reluctantly gives a
          half-smile, her teeth clenched together.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 28.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          No. Put two fingers in the side of
          your mouth. Then two fingers in
          the other side... and pull.
          Jennifer looks at Johnny like he's seriously disturbed as
          Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point.
          Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips
          away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's
          completely humiliating. Jennifer stops.

                         JENNIFER
          Now please... I'm begging you...
          Johnny slides off the counter.

                         JOHNNY
          Uh, uh. Again.
          Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches
          into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with
          his thumb and forefinger.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Alright. Good girl, Show Horse.
          Johnny pulls down on Jennifer's teeth, forcing her to the
          floor. Jennifer looks as if she's about to cry, near her on
          the ground is the broken glass.
          Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys. Matthew
          shuffles nervously, clearly uncomfortable at being there.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          I'll tell you something
          sweetheart... know why you ain't
          got no boyfriend?... 'Cause all
          them city guys are faggots.
          Johnny turns to her.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          But uh... since he isn't here.
          Johnny pulls out his revolver.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          This is your man.
          He moves closer to her, rubbing the gun against her cheek,
          her chin. The blood drains from her face as -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Why don't you give him a kiss-
          With terror in her eyes, Jennifer quickly kisses the gun-

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Nah, not like the peck you gave
          Matthew... let's see a real kiss.
          He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags
          instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not
          allowing her to pull away, and offers some "encouragement."

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Breathe through your nose. Breathe
          through your nose like it was your
          first time.
          Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back
          into her cheek, causing it to bulge out.
          Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical.
          Especially once Jennifer begins to cry.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          On your knees.
          Jennifer complies. Johnny holds the gun in front of his
          crotch and again forces it into Jennifer's mouth.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          if I don't like your enthusiasm, I
          may cum early.
          (cocks the gun)
          And that's something you really
          don't want.
          Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as
          deep as she can take it without gagging.
          Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's
          had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags.
          Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell
          as Andy stands up from the couch.

                         ANDY
          My turn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29A.

                         STANLEY
          Come on, let Matthew have a go.
          It's his girlfriend and he hasn't
          even wet his whistle yet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 30.

                         MATTHEW
          I...I ddd...don't want to.
          Johnny walks up to Matthew, angrily, and slaps him across the
          face. He points to Jennifer.

                         JOHNNY
          What do you mean you don't want to?

                         (TEASING)
          sh...she likes me... she kissed me.
          Now shut up and prove it.
          Matthew holds his fist against his face.

                         ANDY
          Aw, fuck it. I ain't waiting.
          Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE. He walks over to Jennifer,
          still on her knees, and positions the bottle right in front
          of his crotch.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Suck it, bitch.
          Jennifer opens her mouth and moves her head toward the
          bottle. As she maneuvers the bottle-neck into her mouth, her
          eye catches a large shard of glass next to Andy's boot.
          As soon as Andy turns around to smile at his friends,
          Jennifer grabs the bottle and cracks it upside his kneecap.
          Andy immediately grabs his leg and falls to the floor.
          The guys start laughing as--
          Jennifer leaps up from the floor and rushes over to her
          purse. She quickly pulls out a canister of mace -
          Before the guys even register what is happening Jennifer is
          racing at Stanley --
          As he brings the camera down he's met with a spray of mace.
          He clutches his face, screaming in pain --
          And like that - Jennifer is out the back door.

          35 EXT. CABIN - DAWN 35

          Jennifer leaps over the porch steps and sprints across the
          backyard as the first light creeps through the trees. Within
          seconds, she's in the woods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 31.

          36 EXT. WOODS - DAWN 36

          Jennifer runs for all she's worth. Every few yards, she
          looks behind her, just to make sure that no one is chasing
          her. The morning light now fully visible. Then, just as she
          turns back around, Jennifer smacks right into something and
          goes sprawling.
          When her vision comes into focus she sees the side of a shiny
          black boot. Next to it, the long slim barrel of a shotgun.
          Jennifer looks up at the figure.

                         FIGURE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Easy
          darlin'.
          The Figure extends his hand. As Jennifer reaches for it, she
          sees his jacket pull away from his chest, revealing a silver
          badge. She's found SHERIFF STORCH, a small town sheriff with
          a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy.

                         JENNIFER
          Help me. Please!
          Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle,
          is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Okay, okay, I gotcha.
          The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet.

                         EARL
          I know this one. She rented the
          place down on Mockingbird Trail.

                         JENNIFER
          I was assaulted! They broke into
          the cabin! They had a gun-
          Jennifer breaks down again.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am, please, you have to calm
          down.
          But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.

                         JENNIFER
          In my mouth! He put a gun in my
          mouth! You don't understand...

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am, It's okay. I'm the Sheriff.
          You need to take a deep breath and
          tell me what happened.
          Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to
          pull herself together.

                         JENNIFER
          Four men. It was four of them.
          They broke into my cabin... They
          assaulted me!
          Earl just watches not knowing what to do.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Are you hurt? Do you need a
          hospital?
          Jennifer shakes her head.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Okay, good. That's good. Did you
          get a good look at them? Can you
          ID 'em?

                         JENNIFER
          Yes, I'd seen them before.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Around here?

                         JENNIFER
          At the service station right
          outside of town. They work there.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (TO EARL)
          John Miller no doubt.

                         JENNIFER
          Yes. They called him Johnny.
          There was a heavy set guy too--

                         AND --
          Sheriff Storch shakes his head and rolls his eyes.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on
          over to the cabin and straighten
          'em out.

          37 BRT. CABIN - DAY 37
          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer pull up to the cabin. They both
          get out of the cruiser. With his double barrel shotgun in
          hand, Sheriff Storch begins walking up toward the porch.

          38 INT. CABIN - DAY 38 

          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin. It appears
          empty.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Hello?

                         (BEAT)
          Miller? Miller, this is the
          Sheriff. if you and your boys are
          still in there, you come on out
          right now.
          Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second...
          then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the
          stairs. He looks up the staircase.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Miller, if you're up there, you'll
          be leaving by the window.
          No answer. Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Stay here.
          Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable
          at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise,
          every foot step makes her shiver.
          After a few seconds, the Sheriff comes back to the top of the
          stairs.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          It's empty.
          He walks back down.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          No sign of 'em. If they were here,
          they're gone now.
          Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into--

          39 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 39

          Jennifer follows him and watches as he inspects it closely.
          His eyes fall on the box of liquor bottles.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You here alone? 

                         JENNIFER
          Yes.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (RE: LIQUOR)
          With all this?

                         JENNIFER
          I wasn't going to drink it all this
          weekend. I... I planned on being
          here for a couple of months.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Drink some tonight?

                         JENNIFER
          Yes, well, they were. They forced
          me to.
          He moves away and walks back through the cabin.
          As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor... and
          the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her.
          Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to
          Jennifer.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          One of them, he was up there, went
          through everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 35.
          Sheriff Storch taps the broken glass with his thick boot.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          (pointing to the glass)
          They do this, too?

                         JENNIFER
          Please, I don't care about those
          things. They shoved a gun in my
          mouth...
          Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her. 

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now.
          Them boys are gone. You're safe
          now.
          Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock 
          on the back door. 
          He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back 
          and forth.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) 
          (re: back door)
          Was this locked?

                         JENNIFER
          Yes. Of course.

          40 EXT. CABIN - DAY 40 

          Sheriff Storch steps onto the porch. Jennifer follows.
          Sheriff Storch looks down and sees the dead bird at his feet.
          He pokes it with the barrel of his shotgun.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          How long you been here?

                         JENNIFER
          Just a few days.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Anything strange happen before
          this? You have a run in with any
          of these guys?

                         JENNIFER
          No. Not really. I stopped for gas
          and directions.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 36.

          41 INT. CABIN - DAY 41

          Back inside, Sheriff Storch hooks his fingers into his belt
          and continues to look around.
          His eyes casually fall upon the roach sitting in the ashtray.
          He picks it up and smells it.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am, is this your marijuana
          cigarette? 
           Suddenly, Jennifer realizes that simple possession might not
          go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan.

                         JENNIFER
          Uh... n...no. The men probably
          left it.
          Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until he's standing
          directly in front of her.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You mean to tell me that one of
          these guys was wearing lipstick?
          Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick
          smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          This ain't the big city.
          Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close. Slowly, he walks
          closer up to Jennifer's face, stares into her eyelids. Pulls
          down one of them. Then the other. Then his gaze falls down
          to her chest... her ample cleavage. His stare lingers a bit
          too long.

                         JENNIFER
          Please, I swear. I didn't make it
          up. I may have smoked a joint, but-
          Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          (into the walkie-talkie)
          This is Sheriff Storch. I'm at the
          Mockingbird Cabin. I gonna need
          some backup.
          The words out of the Sheriff's mouth seem almost surreal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37.

                         JENNIFER

                         (BECOMING FRANTIC)
          Backup? What could you possibly
          need back up for? I'm the victim.
          Sheriff Storch holds up his hand, cutting her off.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am. You've been drinking and
          smoking marijuana, and you got
          enough alcohol here to put our
          whole town three sheets to the
          wind. You're running around in
          your nighty at the crack of dawn...
          You need to see this from my point
          of view.

                         JENNIFER
          What?! They were here! They
          assaulted me! You've got to
          believe me!

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I just want to get to the bottom of
          it. You're making serious
          accusations bout' boys I've know
          since they was kids, and you 
          haven't been all together truthful
          now have you?

                         (BEAT)
          Now please, against the wall.
          Angry and ashamed, Jennifer walks over and places her palms
          against the wall, her legs pressed tightly together.
          Sheriff Storch inches up behind her. He taps the inside of
          her thigh with his shotgun.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Shoulder width apart, face to the
          wall.
          Jennifer has no choice but to comply.
          He pats up and down Jennifer's side. When he gets to the
          swell of her breast, he slides his hand to the front ever so
          slightly. Jennifer reflexively turns--

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Face to the wall!
          Sheriff Storch puts his hand to the side of her face and puts
          it to the wall. Jennifer cringes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37A.
          Then he kicks her leg out wide with a firm Boot as he starts
          to frisk her entire body, creeping his hands ever so close to
          her crotch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I want the whole story, now. The
          whole thing.

                         (SLOWLY)
          Start with telling me what those
          boys did.
          A long, dreadful beat hangs in the air as--

          JOHNNY (O.S.)
          Yeah, and tell the truth, show
          Horse.
          Jennifer snaps her head around again to see Johnny enter the
          cabin as Andy and Stanely push Matthew in front of them.
          Johnny walks over to Jennifer. He stands next to the
          Sheriff.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Better yet, let's show him. As I
          recall, those pretty little lips
          couldn't get enough.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (MOCK SURPIRSE)
          Really?
          Sheriff Storch then takes the barrel of his shotgun and
          pushes down the top of Jennifer's blouse.
          Jennifer's paralyzed as he runs the shotgun across her
          nipple.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          They do this to you?
          Jennifer is too terrified to speak. Sheriff Storch then
          slips the shotgun down between her legs.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I asked you a question.
          Jennifer trembles with fear.

                         JENNIFER
          Please...

                         JOHNNY
          Show him those teeth, Show Horse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38A.
          Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides
          it under Jennifer's top lip and pushes it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 39.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Whinny.
          With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun,
          Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch
          takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush
          against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor.
          Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I said, whinny.
          Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but
          more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy
          and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end.

                         STANLEY
          Oh, man. Oh, man.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          On your knees. And keep going.
          Jennifer gets to her knees. As instructed, she whinnies,
          interspersed with sobs. Johnny slaps her ass viciously.

                         JOHNNY
          Keep whinnying!
          Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes.
          Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but--
          Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's
          face. The slightest scratch across his lip.
          Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the
          face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of
          blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny,
          licks his lip and nods his head.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Think you outta tame this little
          mare of yours.
          Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.

                         JOHNNY
          Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get
          up. Or you won't get a sugar cube.
          Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them,
          defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far
          back. She lets out a half-moan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 40.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          Take off your clothes. We're about
          to pop your cherry.
          Matthew shakes his head. His wrist is not beat red from the
          rubber bands. Snap!

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          I'm not asking, now cut that rubber
          band shit faggot.

                         STANLEY
          Come on, Matthew. You want to talk
          the talk, then walk the walk, you
          virgin.
          Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's
          bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin,
          past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping
          at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants -
          her pants drop to the floor.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          Do it now. Or else I slice her
          chin to cunt.
          This gets Matthew moving. A few seconds later, he's in his
          boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch.
          Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall. He then
          yanks his boxers down. Matthew immediately covers up his
          crotch.

                         STANLEY
          Matthew, what the hell? It's not
          even hard!
          Matthew sweats profusely.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Well, maybe it's not totally his
          fault. After all, she's not doing
          much to get his motor running.
          Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Dance.
          Jennifer begins to cry again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 41.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Stop it. Or else I'll really give
          you something to cry about. Now
          dance for the boy...
          Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is
          sad, pathetic, and downright frightening.

                         JOHNNY
          Come on. Move that rear of your's
          Show Horse. Prance for us.
          Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he
          walks back in closer to her, in her face.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You dance like that in those city
          clubs?
          Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face.

                         STANLEY
          She dance like that they'd throw
          her butt to the curb.

                         JOHNNY
          Prance like you mean it. Like you
          do when you want to get laid.
          With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass
          and hard.

                         ANDY
          That'll get her moving.
          The guys hoot and holler. Except for Matthew, who looks as
          if he too is about to cry.

                         MATTHEW
          Ok..kkay, I'll d...do it.
          Matthew walks slowly over to Jennifer. With no warning,
          Matthew takes Jennifer's face in his hands and kisses her.
          The men HOWL with sadistic glee. Jennifer slaps him right
          across the face, then she tries to run but--
          Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground. He walks up to
          Matthew.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Don't waste my time you thickheaded
          prick.

          Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her.
          Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthew's
          face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as they
          decide to help him out. Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny
          yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of
          them as she desperately tries to fight him off.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Get her legs!
          Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above
          her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other.
          Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman
          SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all.
          ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in
          and out of focus.
          Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch looks down at
          his pocket, then over to Stanley.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Put that thing down and hold her
          arms, keep her quiet.
          Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - it's still
          getting everything.
          Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape. He
          looks down at the screen of his phone.
          On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the
          banner of CHASTITY. Storch presses a button.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello, Angel.

          CHASTITY (V.0.)
          Hi, Daddy. You at the station?
          Jennifer SCREAMS out. Sheriff Storch keeps his attention on
          the phone call.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          No, Angel. Out on a call.
          WIDESHOT: In the foreground, Sheriff Storch speaks casually
          to his daughter. In the background, Jennifer's legs are the
          only visual cues of the struggle that goes on right behind.

          Oh, sorry.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          It's okay. You need something?

          CHASTITY (V.0.)
          Daddy it's Sunday. You always make
          breakfast before church.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yeah, yeah... well, Daddy's busy,
          Angel. Tell mother I'm running a
          little late.
          Sheriff Storch stares at the phone for a second, then slides
          the phone back into his pocket. As he turns back around
          Jennifer, with all her strength, bucks Matthew off.
          The guys start laughing hysterically.
          She finally gets her hands free and lands a barrage of
          punches in Matthew's face.

                         JOHNNY
          Jesus, Matthew. You're getting
          your ass whooped by a girl!
          Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins
          pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger
          allows him to perform.
          Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to
          her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he
          finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on
          top of her.
          The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak.
          He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off to
          the side as the others just lose it!
          Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          You can thank us later.
          Matthew recovers, gets up and runs to the bathroom. Johnny
          points to the vomit.

                         (TO STANLEY)
          Clean this shit up.

                         STANLEY
          Make her do it.

                         JOHNNY

                         (ANGRILY)
          Just do it you piece of shit!
          Jennifer grabs the end of the coffee table and forces herself
          up. She steadies herself, keeping one hand on the wall, and
          stumbles to the back door. Surprisingly, none of the men
          attempt to stop her. They don't even look in her direction.
          Jennifer staggers out the back door, trying to catch her
          breath as she fearfully stumbles off into the woods.

          42 EXT. WOODS - DAY 42 

          Like a zombie, Jennifer shuffles through the woods, oblivious
          to the cold air, rocks, thorns, mud, as her bare feet move
          her along.
          She desperately continues on through, looking for a way out.
          But in her state, she has no sense of navigation. She
          continues to lose herself further and further into the
          forest.
          As she finally steps into the clearing, the melancholy notes
          of a harmonica shatter the stillness... She's made her way to-

          43 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 43

          Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the
          rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they
          instinctively knew she'd end up here. Jennifer is too
          shocked to move, too tired to cry.
          Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her. He grabs her
          by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down
          in the shallow water. Andy pounces down on her back.
          Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifer's face. He
          places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her. He
          then turns the LCD so it's facing Jennifer -- so she can
          actually watch herself being abused.
          Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there.

                         STANLEY
          You ever get mace in your eyes,
          bitch? It smarts.

          Andy shoves her face down into the water - then pulls her up.
          ON MINIDV CAM: Eyes pried wide open, Jennifer gags as the
          dirty water pours from her nose - mouth - she desperately
          tries to breathe --
          Andy shoves her face down again and again as Stanley films.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D) 
          Hold her head down! Hold it down!! 

                         JOHNNY
          Alright. This filly's got a few
          more races to run--
          Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even 
          turn around, she senses their presence.
          Storch gets down into her face.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I hope you got some fight left in
          you. I like it rough.

                         JENNIFER

                         (BARELY AUDIBLE)
          Please. Please. I'm... so hurt...
          Sheriff Storch spits onto the ground.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass
          man.
          Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants.
          He kneels down behind her..
          Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new
          level of pain as her head is thrust back down.
          Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a
          glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster.
          Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out
          the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one--
          Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look
          in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers.
          Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica... Her eyes
          continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight.
          Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 45A.
           As Jennifer's body is being jerked back and forth, she
          reaches - and reaches - closer with each stretch when--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46.
          A heavy work boot comes down on her hand, crushing it.
          Jennifer looks up.
          Johnny glares down at her, then unzips his pants as he moves
          in closer to her face.

                         JOHNNY
          No teeth Show Horse. No teeth.
          Her vision grows hazy. The sky, water, and ground all seem
          to meld together.

                         TO BLACK:

          BACK IN ON:

          44 EXT. FISHING HOLE - LATER 44

           Cruel laughter brings Jennifer back to. Somehow she manages
           to lift her head to see Stanley pulling up his pants.

                          ANDY
           Wow, Stanley, 30 seconds. Must be
           a record for you.

                         JOHNNY
          Don't you know you should wait for
          the lady?

                         STANLEY
          Bitch was too tight, even after
          ya'll... Sides, she's all bloody...
          I wanted to finish up.

                         ANDY
          Right and we thought Matthew here
          was gonna be the pussy. 

                         JOHNNY
          Don't be so proud of yourself Andy.
          I clocked you at just over two
          minutes.
          Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to
          her feet. The men all stare, impressed at her resolve.
          Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she
          staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a
          miracle she can even walk.
          She continues until the forest ends and she comes upon a--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46A.

          45 EXT. WOODS - DAY 45

           She staggers up to the edge of the woods and comes to a
           clearing, she leans on a tree and sobs hysterically, breaking
           down. 

          AA45 EXT. BRIDGE, TREES - DAY AA45

           Ahead of her a dirt road leads to a small bridge and an open 
          area.
          Painfully she staggers towards the bridge, her beaten and
          bruised body pained with each step.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 47.
          The others appear behind her. They laugh at her as she
          continues further down the bridge.

          A45 EXT. BRIDGE - DAY A45

          Jennifer doesn't bother to turn around. She continues down
          the bridge, looking at the rushing water on both sides.
          She moves to one of the railings.
          The Sheriff looks at her and cocks the shotgun.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Sorry. it was fun while it lasted.

                         JOHNNY
          Yeah, too bad we have to put you
          down, Show Horse.
          in a final act of defiance, Jennifer falls back off the
          bridge and into the murky, moving water.
          immediately, the men rush to the edge of the bridge.
          The Sheriff's gun cocked and ready-- Tracking down the water -
          Not a sign.
          They all look down, waiting, still nothing.

                         STANLEY
          Where'd she go?

                         ANDY
          She's gotta come up for air
          sometime.

                         STANLEY 
          Current's got her. Shit, in her 
          condition she's already drowned.
          Johnny looks to the Sheriff who's gun is trained on the water
          waiting for something... anything.

                         JOHNNY
          Sheriff?
          Sheriff Storch pulls back his gun, and adjusts his hat, deep
          in thought.

          check under the bridge, both banks,
          in the trees right now.
          They all look at him. 

                         ANDY 
          I ain't got my waders... 

                         SHERIFF STORCH 
          I said right fuekin' now before I 
          throw you over! 

          46 EXT. BRIDGE -- DAY 46 

           The guys have returned. They are all muddy and wet. Storch 
           stands stoic still looking down at the water. He turns to 
           them. 

                          JOHNNY 
           Nothin'... 

                          SHERIFF STORCH 
           Listen up. 'Bout six miles 
           downstream the creek ends in
           Hendersonville. somewhere between 
           here and there we're gonna find
           her. We split up. We check the 
           banks, in the timber, under a rock, 
          hell if you see a hole big enough
          for a rat I want it checked out.
          And don't stop 'til you find me a
          body.

                         STANLEY

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Six miles, Sheriff? She's at the
          bottom of the river. She's gator
          bait. I think we should just let
          it go.
          A single vein pulses in Sheriff Storch's temple. He grabs
          Stanley by the collar.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (PURE RAGE)

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          You just shut your trap and do
          every goddamned thing I say. I got
          a wife a kid and one in the oven.
          There is no way that I'm going to 
          let anything happen to them because
          you're too stupid and too sloppy to
          clean up your fuckin' mess.
          The weight of the Sheriff's words register on all of them...
          except Matthew who oddly enough has started to come around --
          as if he just woke up in the middle of this nightmare.

                         MATTHEW
          She slipped and fell!
          Matthew stands up, nervous, jittery, coming unglued.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          None of us touched her. I saw it.
          She was just... it was an accident.
          Johnny rolls his eyes and shakes his head.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Can someone get this dipshit outta
          my face! I don't need none of you
          screwing the pooch on this, least
          of all numbnuts over there.
          Sheriff Storch lets go of Stanley's collar and gives it a
          quick pat, almost like an imperceptible apology for his
          behavior.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Now let's move... find me a body!

                         46 OMITTED 46

          47 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 47 

           The reservoir is much calmer at these parts. Sheriff stands
           on watch as-
           Stanley and Andy come from the water in waders having just 
           searched the water.
          Matthew stands where they just came from. He stays, staring
          at the swamp like water as if Jennifer was somewhere in 
          there.
          Johnny finishes off a cigarette and flicks it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 49.

                         ANDY
          Nothing. Not a damn thing.

                         JOHNNY
          Well, what now?
          Storch takes another look down the river, scanning it.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          The body'll turn up. One way or
          another. Every day we check the
          ravine, from the bridge, straight 
          through down here, then back. Two
          shifts a day until we find 
          something. 'Cause with no body, 
          you're all as fucked as she is.

                         STANLEY
          For how long?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          'Til I say! Okay?! Andy, you go
          back to the cabin and get rid of her
          shit. All of it! Burn it. And we
          need to sanitize that place
          something good. I don't want so
          much as a stray hair left.

                         (TO JOHNNY)
          Get her car to the shop. Strip it
          down to its last damn nut.

                         JOHNNY
          I'll buff out the serial numbers
          too. Sell the parts at salvage.
          Storch nods in approval as his eyes wander to the camera.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          .and give me that.
          Sheriff Storch rips the camera from Stanley's hands. He
          pulls out the tape.
          He throws the tape to the ground and stomps on it, smashing
          it to bits. Stanley opens his mouth to say something, thinks
          better of it, and closes it quickly.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          The fuck were you saving that for

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I need all you on point. I mean,
          on fuckin' point. We clear?

                         (BEAT)
          Now let's go, we got shit to do.
          Matthew continues to stare off into the distance, waist deep
           in the water. 
          48 ER's. WOODS - DUSK 48 
          CLOSE UP on a match. Dirty fingers pull the match across the
          flint on the side of a matchbox. The match explodes to life.
          A hand drops the match on top of Jennifer's belongings: her
          clothes, laptop, the dry goods she purchased at the store.
          It's all piled up on the grass.
          Johnny, Stanley, and Andy watch quietly as the flames and
          smoke from the fire reach into the sky. Andy throws a metal
          container of gasoline onto the ground.

                         ANDY
          So that's everything. Right down
          to her little tit sling.

                         JOHNNY
          And there was no trace at all?
          Nothing in the woods? In the
          shallows?
          Andy shakes his head. Stanley rubs his eyes hard.

                         STANLEY
          I'm starving, man.

                         JOHNNY
          Well ain't that the headline. Soon 
          as we finish this and haul her car
          into the garage, you can stuff your
          face 'til you puke.

                         (TO ANDY)
          What the hell happened to Matthew?

                         ANDY
          Idiot wanted to stay there. He was
          walking around in the water,
          looking for her like some crazed
          dog after a bone.

                         JOHNNY

          Least until all this shit blows
          over.
          The flames rise up and engulf her remaining personal items.

          49 EXT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 49 

          Sheriff Storch pulls up to his house. He parks in the
          driveway and gets out of his car.
          He walks slowly up to his front door. Just as he reaches out
          to grab the door handle, the front door opens. MRS. STORCH
          is there to greet him.

          MRS. STORCH
          Gone all day. I got nervous.
          Anything worth telling?

          50 INT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 50

          Mrs. Storch closes the door behind them. Chastity races from
          her room holding a piece of paper.

                         CHASTITY
          Daddy! Daddy!
          Sheriff Storch picks up his daughter and kisses her head.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Just the usual, domestic dispute
          out near Clifton. Took forever.

                         (BEAT)
          Got anything on the stove?

          MRS. STORCH
          Sure. I'll reheat it.

                         (RE: CHASTITY)
          You'll be proud.
          Chastity brings forth the piece of paper. Sheriff turns to
          her.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Oh yeah, what am I gonna be proud
          of?

                         CHASTITY
          I was accepted to the honors
          program, daddy. can you believe
          it?
          Sheriff puts her down. Proud.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Of course I can. I expect nothing
          less from my Angel.

                         (BEAT)
          Mommy and I are proud of you. Real
          proud.

                         (BEAT)
          Alright. I'm gonna shower up.
          Sheriff walks of as Mrs. Storch watches for a second and
          then heads into the kitchen.

          51 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 51 

          Sheriff Storch's cruiser pulls up to Earl's house and comes
          to a stop in a cloud of dust.

          52 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 52 

          Sheriff Storch stands on Earl's porch, pounds on the door.

          EARL (O.S.)
          It's open.
          Sheriff Storch pushes open the screen door.

          53 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 53 

          He enters. Immediately, he brings his hand to his mouth and
          coughs violently.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Every time I come in here this
          place gets worse.
          Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water.

                         EARL
          Yeah, but business gets better.
          That's the trade off.

          Yeah, well, you're lucky I don't
          cite you for being a public health
          hazard.
          Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of
          keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl
          finally looks up, confused.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Mockingbird Trail.

                         EARL
          Mockingbird Trail, what? -- Oh,
          right, Miss Hills. What happened?
          She left?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Yeah, I couldn't make heads or
          tails of it. Found marijuana
          cigarettes, case of booze, looked 
          to me like she was a party girl...
          a very wild one.

                         EARL
          Yeah, yeah. I had her pegged from
          minute one. She wreck the place?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Nah, place is fine. She packed up
          and split.

                         EARL
          My lucky day.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Why's that?

                         EARL

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Christmas come early. Enjoy it.

                         EARL
          (changes the subject)
          Speaking of early, only a month
          'til quail season. Don't know 
          about you but I'm getting tired of
          shooting squirrels.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Me too.

          Earl nods. Sheriff tips his hat and walks out.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          54 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 54 

          THE CAMERA tilts down from the treeline and falls back on
          Hendersonville. It's serene, peaceful and lonely. 
          Matthew sits in a small boat. He's been patrolling for
          Jennifer's body, but now the boat just sits in the middle of
          the swamp where the river runs out.
          He stares out into the water as we slowly creep closer, and
          closer until we're extremely close on his face, his eyes
          unmoving.

          A55 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY A55

          POV: A car with two women pulls up to the gas pump. Johnny
          comes out of the garage and saunters over to them.
          Johnny playfully harasses the women. To a casual observer,
          it would seem harmless. But we know it could be the prelude
          to something unspeakable.
          Finally, the women pull away. Johnny walks back into the
          garage, a smug, self-satisfied smile on his face.

          55 INT. SERVICE STATION, GARAGE - DAY 55 

          Andy is bent over Jennifer's car, or at least what's left of
          it. At this point, it's nothing more than a shell. He wears
          a welding helmet and is hard at work with a blowtorch.

                         ANDY
          (from under the car)
          Round up some tail out there?

                         JOHNNY
          Maybe. Guarantee you they'll be
          back.
          Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding
          a six pack of beer.

                         STANLEY
          It's happy hour.

          Johnny opens his hands, signaling Stanley to toss him a can.
          Andy shuts off the blowtorch and lifts up the helmet.

                         ANDY
          Fucking A.
          Johnny cracks open the beer and takes a gulp. He wipes the
          back of his hand across his mouth.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO STANLEY)
          You bought beer? What'd your
          mother put you back on an
          allowance?
          They all laugh.

                         STANLEY
          Just figured we deserved a break.
          Andy holds up his beer in a mock toast.

                         ANDY
          To your moma.
          Johnny points to Andy, his beer still in his hand.

                         JOHNNY
          Just one, you hear me? Don't need
          you passing out on your watch you
          lightweight.
          Andy takes a large sip.

                         ANDY
          Heck, just let Matthew take all the
          shifts. He's been down there
          everyday anyway. Even when it's
          not his turn. 
          They all look to one another.

                         JOHNNY
          The fuck's he doing down there?

                         ANDY
          I don't know. Last time I saw him,
          he wasn't lookin' too good.
          Maybe we should give him a break.
          Pull him off all together.

          Bullshit. It's been over two
          weeks. I'm tired of searching. If
          she didn't turn up yet, she ain't
          gonna.

                         JOHNNY
          You'll keep lookin' till I tell ya'
          to stop.
           As he turns away there is a bag of Stanley's pork rinds, he 
           grabs it and throws it at Stanley.

                          JOHNNY (CONT'D) 
           Here's your supplies. 
           Andy starts to laugh as Johnny exits. 

          56 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 56

           From a distance we see Andy laughing and Johnny walking off.

          A57 INT. CABIN - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 62) A57 

          Matthew stands in the main room staring at the floor - the
          exact place where he raped Jennifer. After a long, drawn out
          moment, he turns and walks to--

          B57 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY (FORHERLY SCENE 62) B57 

          He looks down to the toilet, then the bathtub. He turns
          around accidentally catches his reflection in the mirror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 57.
          His greasy, unkempt hair hangs in front of his eyes. He
          pushes it to the side and stares at himself for a long time.
          Finally, Matthew reaches to the light switch, he flicks it
          off. Immediately, the room goes dark. But the second it
          does...
          JENNIFER is sitting on the bed just like when they first met.

          DEAD, DRENCHED, BEATEN, BATTERED, AND DECAYED, BUT IT'S

                         JENNIFER --
          Matthew is paralyzed with fear, he tries to turn as a
          grizzly, decayed hand grabs his forehead. Another grabs hold
          of his throat.
          A mouth caked with dirt and dried blood begins to kiss up his
          neck, his face-
          Matthew screams wildly

          58 EXT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 58

          The Sheriff's car sits in the driveway. It's dark, but for
          the light from a TV strobing against the drapes.

          59 INT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 59 

          All is quiet. Sheriff Storch reclines in his lazyboy. Mrs.
          Storch is on the sofa rifling through a TV journal.
          The phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch lifts his head up. Mrs.
          Storch reaches over and answers.

          MRS. STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello?
          (hands it to him)
          It's Earl.
          Storch takes the phone from her.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Earl?

          60 INT. EARL'S PLACE -- NIGHT 60

          Earl fidgets with his tanks, cleaning, scraping algae. But
          you can tell he's nervous about something.

                         EARL
          Yeah, so, this woman leaves a
          message on the machine. Barbara
          something or other.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Yeah, so...

                         EARL
          She was looking for that Miss
          Hills. Says no one's seen her in
          over a month. Ain't that about when
          she split?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Yeah, and... you know the story.

                         EARL
          I don't know. I wasn't there. I
          think you should call her back. I
          mean heck, sheriff, you may have
          been the last person to see her.
          The Sheriff's blood starts to boil, he wants to say more, but
          looks to his wife... then controls himself.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Sheriff?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Okay. I'll give her a call.

                         EARL
          Good. You want the number?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Nah, It's late. I'll pick it up
          from you in the am. We're still on
          for tomorrow, right?

                         EARL
          Yeah, of course.
          Sheriff Storch hangs up. Mrs. Storch looks up.

          MRS. STORCH
          Is everything okay?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Just fine.

          BLAM: A SHOTGUN blasts as smoke billows from the barrel. In
          the distance, the shapes of Sheriff Storch and Earl come into
          focus.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Can you believe there used to be a
          limit on quail? Goddamn things are 
          like locust now.

                         EARL
          Much to our good fortune.
          Earl points to a nearby log.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Let's take a break. My dogs are
          barking something fierce.
          Earl plops down on the log.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You're getting old, Earl. I
          remember back when you and my old 
          man chased that buck out of the 
          hollows on Stickler's Farm before
          bagging it.

                         EARL

                         (LAUGHS)
          Those were the good of days.
          Sheriff Storch joins Earl on the log. He reaches into his
          hunting bag and pulls out a bottle of really good whiskey.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Here's to the good of days.
          Earl looks at him, surprised.

                         EARL

                         (RE: BOTTLE)
          Wow, fan-cy. To what do I owe?
          Sheriff Storch smiles, screws off the top, and passes the
          bottle to Earl. Earl takes a swig.

          Some damn fine whiskey. Usually
          don't have that 'cept at baptisms
          and weddings.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          And funerals.
          BLAM: -- Earl's chest erupts in a geyser of blood.
          Earl drops to the ground like a rag doll. The bottle falls
          from his grasp. The whisky flows into the dirt.
          Sheriff Storch stands up, clutching his smoking shotgun.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Loose ends, Earl. Loose ends...
          Sheriff Storch hovers over his prey. Suddenly, Earl's body
          spasms. His eyes flicker and a nauseating gurgle sounds from
          deep in his throat.
          BLAM: -- Sheriff Storch crosses himself -- touching his
          forehead and both shoulders -- turns away from the corpse.

          65 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY 65 

          Johnny and Andy are sitting on the porch in lawn chairs
          drinking beer.
          Both of them turn to see Stanley bounding up to the station
          in a tizzy.

                         ANDY
          Jeez look at this.

                         JOHNNY
          Something's spooked the cattle.

          Stanley storms into the garage.

                         ANDY
          Jesus, Stanley. Calm down.

          What the hell's got your nuts tied
          in a sling?
          Stanley is completely out of breath.

                         STANLEY
          It's gone. My camera. It's gone!
          Andy looks at him, visibly annoyed.

                         ANDY
          Maybe you accidentally ate it?

                         STANLEY
          Fuck off, this is serious!
          Johnny shakes his head.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          it had the tape in it.

                         JOHNNY
          The hell you talking about?

                         STANLEY
          The tape, Johnny. The goddamn
          tape!

                         JOHNNY
          Wait a minute. You mean the one
          Storch smashed to bits. That tape?

                         STANLEY
          He didn't smash shit. I put in a
          new one... Sheriff stomped the one 
          with nothing on it.

                         JOHNNY
          You stupid retard piece of shit.
          You tellin' me you kept the tape?
          Johnny grabs Stanley by the neck and slams him up against a
          car, and begins to Strangle the life out of him.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Where is it?!

                         STANLEY

          Finally, Andy intercedes prying Johnny's hands off Stanley's
          neck. Stanley falls to the ground, gasping for breath.
          Johnny kicks him in the ribcage.

                         JOHNNY
          You're too dumb to know how dumb
          you are. Where's the fuckin'
          tape?!

                         STANLEY
          (struggling to breathe)
          I had it. Now it's gone.

                         ANDY
          Was ya robbed? Or did you leave it
          somewhere?

                         STANLEY
          It was in my place... I swear it.

                         JOHNNY
          Who else knew about it?
          A beat of silence hangs in theair.

                         STANLEY
          Matthew. I showed it to him.
          Off all their incredulous looks.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Was trying to cheer him up.

                         JOHNNY
          The kid's barely got one oar in the
          water and you just took it and
          shoved it up his ass.
          Andy walks by Stanley and slaps him in the head for good
          measure.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)

          Stanley is still on the ground, making disgusting noises. A
          combination of sobbing, puking, and wheezing.

                         STANLEY
          You can't tell him Johnny. You
          can't.
          Johnny ponders for a second.

          Johnny slaps Stanley in the head again for good measure.

          in the meantime, find that little

          66 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66 

          Johnny reclines on his couch, watching TV. One hand is down
          his pants and the other holds a bottle of whisky.
          Suddenly, there's a CRASH at his front door. Johnny looks up
          and puts down the bottle, not overly concerned.

                         JOHNNY
          Hello?
          No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch,
          annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door
          and yanks it open.
          The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the
          door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop.
          Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then
          he closes the door and returns to the couch.

          But as soon as he picks up the bottle, there's another CRASH
          at the front door. Johnny, now pissed, races to the front
          door and swings it open.
          A second dead bird has joined the first. Without closing the
          door, Johnny backs up into his house.
          A few seconds later, he returns to the front door, pistol in
          hand. He steps out onto the porch.

          67 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 67

          Johnny holds the gun in front of him. He pivots slowly from
          side to side, scanning the entire property. No more birds.
          In fact, nothing at all. Dead silence.

                         JOHNNY

                         (THREATENING)
          Who's out there?!
          No answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Shit ain't funny fuckers!!! See
          how funny a bullet in your ass is!
          When there's still no response -- Johnny finally backs up
          into the house and closes the door.

          68 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68

          Again, back to the couch. And again, the second his ass hits
          the cushion, another CRASH.

                         JOHNNY
          Got dammit!
          This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open,
          cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night.

          69 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 69

          Johnny causally looks down - but this time it's not a bird.
          It's a shoe... Jennifer's shoe.
          Johnny bends down and picks it up. He studies it. Frowns.
          Someone's gone too far. Then he hears something scurry off
          in-the distance.

          Quickly Johnny gives chase - leaping off his porch and racing
          in the direction of the sound.

          Johnny stops, listens, and waits. Nothing but silence. He
          turns around in all directions.
          Johnny spits and turns around to walk back and as he does, he
          notices one of Matthew's colored RUBBER BANDS lying in the
          mud.

                         JOHNNY

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          Son of a bitch.

          Sheriff Storch enters, holding a bouquet of flowers. He
          closes the door behind him and walks in.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Helen?
          Within seconds, Mrs. Storch materializes, apron on and wiping
          her hands on a dish towel.

          MRS. STORCH
          Oh, they're beautiful...
          Sheriff Storch walks over and gives her a kiss on the cheek.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I've been --

          MRS. STORCH
          No need to explain. You just
          buried your close friend. And you
          haven't taken a single day off.
          You're only human.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I guess.

          MRS. STORCH
          Hey, maybe you can help me while I
          put these in water.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Help with what?

          MRS. STORCH
          We got this tape delivered it don't
          fit our machine. 

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          What tape?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 66.
          Mrs. Storch scurries over to the coffee table, grabs the
          MINIDV tape and hands it to him.

          MRS. STORCH
          it came this morning...
          But as Storch looks over the tape, the color, the markings...
          no, it couldn't be, he smashed that tape.

          MRS. STORCH (CONT'D)
          I think it might be Chastity's
          recital.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Did Chastity see this?

          MRS. STORCH
          No, like I said, we couldn't get it
          to play.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Where is she?

          MRS. STORCH
          Sleeping, why?
          Storch wipes his face with his hand, then shoves the tape
          into his shirt pocket.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I'll... I'll be back...
          Sheriff Storch quickly turns away from his wife and hurries
          out the door.
          Mrs. Storch stands at the door and watches with growing
          curiosity as the cruiser peels out of the driveway, a cloud
          of dust in its wake.

          71 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY 71

          Andy and Stanley pull up and get out of the truck as Johnny's
          been pacing.

                         ANDY
          So what's all this about, Johnny?
          Johnny takes out Jennifer's shoe and throws it at them. They
          both dodge a hit and look at the shoe on the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 66A.

                         STANLEY

                         (TERRIFIED)
          Where'd you get that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 67.

                         JOHNNY
          Somebody threw it at my fuckin'
          door.
          Then snaps Matthew's rubber band at them it hits Stanley who
          winces.

                         STANLEY
          Jees, Matthew? Come on--

                         JOHNNY
          Did either of you find that little
          prick?

                         ANDY
          No. No one knows where he is--
          Suddenly, a car SCREECHES up - it's Storch and it looks as if
          he is going to drive his cruiser straight through the fence.

                         STANLEY
          Ah shit. This ain't good.
          Johnny picks the shoe up.
          Storch blasts out of his car, shotgun in hand. He cocks his
          shotgun and levels it directly at Stanley as he backs him up,
          planting the shotgun into his cheek.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)

                         (CRYING)
          Please, Sheriff! I didn't do
          anything.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Then you want to tell me why this
          was dropped off at my house?! To
          my WIFE!
          Storch shoves the TAPE in Stanley's mouth - gagging him.
          Then turns to Johnny.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          What's on that tape?! Is this some
          kind of fucked up joke? I smashed
          the damn thing myself!

                         JOHNNY
          Nah, genius over here reloaded.
          Tape you smashed had nothing on it.
          Storch looks to Johnny - then snaps his gun towards him.

                         JOHNNY
          Hey, I just found out myself.
          Storch swings the gun back to Stanley.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Eat that tape fatboy.
          Andy starts to laugh as Starch trains the gun back on them-

                         STORCH
          Shut your pie hole. Think this is
          funny?! I'll have him shit it down
          your throat when's he done eating
          it. Got that boy?
          .LAM; The Sheriff fires a shot into the air. They all jump,
          Stanley covers his ears like it hurt.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          See, there's two kinds of crazy
          people. One likes to get buck
          naked and howl at the moon. The
          other kind does the exact same
          thing, only in my backyard. The
          first kind'I don't have to deal
          with, you know?
          The Sheriff walks right into Stanley's face as he continues
          to chew the plastic.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          The second kind, well... you're in
          my yard. 

                         JOHNNY
          It's Matthew, Sheriff. Stanley kept 
          the souvenir, but Matthew's the
          one that took it.
          The Sheriff backs off a beat, sizes up the situation.
          Johnny brings forth the shoe. Sheriff's eyes seethe with
          rage.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          The crazy bastard left me a
          present.

                         ANDY
          Fucking retard is obsessed with
          her. I think he actually feels
          guilty.

          gonna cut his little pecker off and
          use it as a goddamn hood ornament.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          And that's after I'm done shoving
          it up your dirt hole. Now where is
          he?!
          Storch takes a deep breath. He looks at all of them, fuming.

                         ANDY
          We don't know. Isn't coming around
          much.

                         JOHNNY
          Much? At all. Kid's fucked three
          ways to Sunday. We can't find him
          and trust me, we been looking.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You losers couldn't find your own
          asses with both hands and a map.

                         (BEAT)
          You got 24 hours. You understand?
          I will not hesitate. Not for one
          second.
          He fixes them all with a steely gaze and loads the shotgun
          again.

          72 EXT. CABIN - DAY 72 

          Matthew, disheveled and weary, stumbles up the steps of the
          cabin. We get the feeling that this is almost a daily
          pilgrimage, as if he returns here to assuage his guilt.
          He rests his head on the wooden railing of the porch, for a
          moment it looks as if he's about to cry.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          (from inside the cabin;
          creepy and ethereal)
          Matthew...
          Matthew's head snaps up. He's almost certain he imagined it,
          just like he's been imagining many things these days.

          VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Math...ewwww...

                         MATTHEW
          Who's there?
          Matthew walks cautiously into the cabin.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 70.

          73 INT. CABIN - DAY 73

           But there is no one in sight. Matthew looks around from side
           to side, his eyes wide, filled with madness... . and then, he
           hears it again.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           Math...eeeeeee... . you...
           It's coming from upstairs - Matthew sprints up.

          74 INT. CABIN, UPSTAIRS - DAY 74

          Matthew, wild-eyed and panicked, gets to the top of the
          steps. He takes a heavy breath and then moves into the lone
          bedroom. seconds later he comes out, obviously empty.

                         MATTHEW

                         (SCREAMS)
          Where are you?!
          Barely a second later, he receives his answer.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Matthew...
          This time, it's definitely coming from downstairs. Matthew
          glances down the staircase. When he sees that nobody is
          waiting at the bottom, he heads down there.
          But once his foot touches the third step, the board gives out
          as Matthew crashes down the steps, ass-over-tea kettle.

          75 INT. CABIN - DAY 75

          MATTHEW'S POV: His vision is completely blurry. He
          struggles to get his bearings as he lays at the bottom of the
          stairs; the side of his head rests on the floor. A thin
          line of blood has already started to run down his cheek.
          Matthew's vision starts to come back into focus as a BLURRY
          IMAGE starts to move away from him. As the IMAGE gets
          further away - it comes into focus - JENNIFER
          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the 
          beating and trauma she went through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 71.
          Matthew grunts and groans as he tries to get up--

                         MATTHEW

                         (STAMMERS)
          I... I knew you were alive. I knew it.
          Jennifer turns to him now.

                         JENNIFER
          How do you know, Matthew?
          Matthew props himself up with his hands and manages to get
          into a sitting position.

                         MATTHEW
          Huh?

                         JENNIFER
          How do you know I'm alive? Are you
          sure you're'not dreaming again? 
          Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not
          sure of anything any more.

                         MATTHEW
          I...am I dreaming?
          Jennifer pats the couch next to her.

                         JENNIFER
          Come here. Come sit down.
          Matthew staggers to his feet. He's overcome with emotion.

                         MATTHEW
          I... I... need to tell...
          Jennifer holds a single finger to her lips.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 72.

                         JENNIFER
          Shh... it's all okay, Matthew. I
          know that none of this was your
          fault. You tried to help me.

                         MATTHEW
          I did... I really did.

                         JENNIFER
          I know that, Matthew. Now come.
          Matthew sits down next to Jennifer. It's almost as if some
          force is controlling him. Matthew looks into her eyes.
          He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifer's lap. He 
          finally lets himself go, like a child having a meltdown.

                         MATTHEW

                         (SOBBING)
          I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

                         JENNIFER
          (stroking his head)
          Shh...I know. I know you are.
          Matthew's so caught up in the moment, that he fails to notice
          A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked
          around his neck.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          But tell me again, Matthew. I want
          to hear how sorry you are.
          Matthew's eyes fly open. Jennifer's hands jerk backwards.
          The rope digs into his flesh. He tries to speak but his
          windpipe can't produce any sound.
          Matthew rolls to the floor, Jennifer never loses her grasp.
          She stands over Matthew, twisting the rope as hard as she
          can. His eyes bulge, the veins in his face protrude--
          Realizing he's about to slip away forever, Matthew displays
          one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to
          get her foot on his chest and pulls harder.
          Frightened and furious, Matthew whips Jennifer around again.
          But she refuses to let go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOXG PINK 10/29/09 73.
          Finally, Matthew's body has had enough. He feet stop kicking
          and just twitch. Then he just gasps like a fish dying out of
          water.
          Jennifer bends over Matthew. She's only inches from his
          face. He's alive, but in terrible shape.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          (whispers in his ear)
          Tell me again...
          CLOSE ON: Matthew's mouth. He can't actually speak; his
          voice box shattered. But he mouths the words.

                         MATTHEW

                         (STRUGGLING)
          I'm sorry.

                         JENNIFER
          I'm sorry? That's just not good
          enough.
          She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to

                         CHOKE HIM--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Now I want you to cry like a little
          girl for me.
          Matthew begins to wail.

          A75 EXT. CABIN, DAY A75

           Matthews screams echoes out through woods, but his, much like
           Jennifer, go unheard.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          B75 EXT. WOODS. NIGHT B75

           Silence. A full moon hangs low in the night sky, casting an
           eerie glow over the entire area. A sense of calm restored.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          C75 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT C75

           Jennifer walks into focus - 
          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the
          beating and trauma she went through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 73A.
          But in her eyes --- her eyes still tell the whole story. This 
           is no longer the Jennifer we've known. She looks down. 
           ANGLE ON: A BIBLE, the old moldy one from the dilapidated 
           shack. It rests on the windowsill - opened to a passage. 
          CZrO$E ON: Exodus 21:23-25: .And if any mischief follow, 
           than thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for 
           tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, 
           wound for wound, stripe for stripe.. 
          Jennifer looks up. 

                          JENNIFER 
           Forgive me father, for I will sin. 

          76 EST. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 76
          Andy and Stanley make their way to the falls. They carry
          flashlights, but they're turned off as day has broken.
          Stanley shovels pork rinds into his mouth, and offers some to
          Andy. They are tired, weary, and you get the sense they have
          been looking all night.

                         STANLEY
          You want some? My last bag.

                         ANDY
          No, get that shit out of my face.

                         STANLEY
          What's your problem?

                         ANDY
          I'm tired, I'm hungry--

                         STANLEY
          I offered you--

                         ANDY
          I don't want that shit. I want
          real food, I want my bed, I want
          this bullshit to be over.

                         STANLEY
          Well the sooner we find Matthew... 

                         ANDY
          Yeah, that's right. The sooner we
          find Matthew what?

                         ANDY
          Ain't it obvious? We drag that homo 
          back to the sheriff, he's a dead
          man.

                         STANLEY
          So what? Better him than me.

                         ANDY

                         (ANGRILY)
          You kept the tape! We're all
          getting heat for your stupidity!

                         (BEAT)
          Now let's just split up and get
          this over with.
          They both separate. Stanley heads around into the woods,
          Andy heads the other way.

          77 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER, WOODS - DAY 77

          We're with Stanley as he walks further into the woods, his
          eyes scan in all directions... but there is nothing there.

          78 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER, WATERLINE - DAY 78

          We're with Andy as he walks the waterline.

                         ANDY
          Matthew?!
          Then, Andy notices an uneven ripple in the water. He thinks
          nothing of it... until it happens again.
          This catches his eye. Slowly he makes his way over. The
          water has calmed now, but still, Andy has a sense that
          something is not right.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew!
          As he gets close to the water - he now sees his reflection...
          He squints his eyes trying to get a better look at what is
          beneath the surface --
          WHOOSH! SOMETHING runs right behind his back - the entire
          reflection caught in the water --
          Andy spins around - as he staggers into the water - no one is
          there... nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 74A.
          just the calm breeze through the trees -- but then a small
          outcrop of bushes rustle as if something just moved through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 75.
          Andy calms - then makes his way over with purpose-

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Only making it worse for yourself,
          Matt.
          Andy picks up his pace as he nears the tree line - right
          where he saw the movement.
          Out of the corner of his eye, he sees another branch swinging
          unnaturally. He races over--
          CLOSER: He can actually hear breathing - it's getting louder-

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew?-

          STANLEY JUMPS OUT--

                         STANLEY
          Boo!

                         ANDY
          Jesus! You bastard!
          Stanley laughs so hard he starts to cough -- Just as they're
          about to continue on - the sound of a harmonica breaks
          through. The same eerie tune.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          What the--?

                         STANLEY
          Prick's playing your song.
          He looks at Stanley.

                         ANDY
          The hell with the Sheriff, I'm
          gonna kill him myself... MATTHEW!!

          79 EXT. WOODS - DAY 79

          Andy and Stanley run through the woods, trying to find the
          source of the sound.

                         ANDY
          You're ass is grass Matthew!! 
          Branches and leaves fly by as Andy barrels through the
          foliage. Stanley tries to keep up, but it's no use.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 76.
          The SOUND changes direction - they look off to see SOMEONE
          flash through the trees.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          There he is. That way!

                         STANLEY
          Matthew! You're a dead man!
          They race off after the sound.

          80 EXT. WOODS - DAY 80 

          They continue on - Stanley doesn't look too good.

                         ANDY
          Don't you pass out on me. I ain't
          dragging your ass back.
          Suddenly, the tune stops. Andy stops in his tracks, trying
          to figure out which way to proceed. Suddenly, Stanley hears
          another sound. Crying.

                         STANLEY
          Hear that?
          They're off again. About fifty yards away, hidden behind the
          trees, is the SHACK. Something slips around the side of the
          structure. Stanley immediately spots what he thinks is
          Matthew.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Matthew!

                         ANDY
          He's in there all right.

                         STANLEY
          Good, cause he's coming out in pieces.
          Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath
          behind him.

          81 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 81

          Andy enters. The shack appears as we first saw it, only now
          there are remnants of recent life.

                         ANDY
          Matthew! Where the fuck are you!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77.
          Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes. It almost
          looks like... a makeshift pillow.
          He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some
          preserved meal. He tosses it to the ground.

          82 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82 

          Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About
          twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree.

                         STANLEY
          Why you little bitch...
          Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A
          hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is
          intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls
          to the ground in agony

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God!
          ON ANDY: As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground
          writhing in pain.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Please! Andy! My fucking leg!
          Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his
          hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone
          behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one
          from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face!
          He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the
          back of the head.

                         TO BLACK:

          BACK IN ON:

          83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83

           Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty 
           wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks 
           up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on. 
          He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is
          completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured
          with ropes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77A.
          Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough.
          Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the
          trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it.

                         ANDY

                         (PAINED SCREAMS)
          Help! Somebody! Help me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 78.
          His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream.
          With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be
          long until the water is above his head.
          He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face
          down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've.

          84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84

          STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video
          camera.

                         JENNIFER
          I know. You like to watch. Don't
          you. Don't you worry, I'll give 
          you quite a show.
          She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his
          face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him.
          Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in
          position, duct tapped back against the tree.
          His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one
          still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with
          every move.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Since you like to watch.
          She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he
          did to her.
          She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say
          something but his pain is too intense.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
          Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe
          it's because you're hungry.
          Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You know, you have to eat some real
          nasty shit out here to stay alive.

                         STANLEY
          Bbbb... bitch! Let me go!
          She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT
          INFESTED RODENT into his mouth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 79.

                         JENNIFER
          What's wrong, you don't like it? I
          prefer the maggots to the meat.
          Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the
          monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over
          and into a burlap sack.
          Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of
          him.
          Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of
          fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks.
          Stanley's eyes go wide.
          Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one
          between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip.
          Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.

                         STANLEY
          Wh...what are you doing with that?

                         JENNIFER

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh... just some fishing. I know
          how much you guys like to fish.
          Finally, when she's finished, she scurries behind Stanley's
          head. From behind him, she grabs his eyelid and pulls it
          away from the eyeball itself.

                         STANLEY
          What are you.. Please don't...
          Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing
          line back over his head.
          Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread
          his eyelid open, slowly, methodically, delivering as much
          pain with every pull of the line, from one eye to the next.
          His eyeballs bulge unnaturally, twitching wildly--
          All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the
          monitor.

                         JENNIFER
          I'll be back before you have a
          chance to blink.
          Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to--
          WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.

          How ya' doing sport?

                         ANDY
          Please... please... I can't...

                         JENNIFER
          Please? I thought, no, I'm pretty
          sure you said something like
          this...
          Jennifer grabs a wad of his HAIR and SMASHES his face into

                         THE WATER-

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Suck it bitch.
          She pulls his head back up.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Does that ring any bells?
          Jennifer gets real close to his ear--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         SUCK--
          She slams his head back down and holds it - then up--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         IT--
          She slams his head back down again and holds it then up--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Bi tch.
          She holds his head down for a very long time as his body
          struggles - then up.
           Andy gasps for breath as Stanley's screams get louder--

                          JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           I think Stanley's calling me. I'll
           be right back. If you need me-
           She walks off--

          BACK TO STANLEY: Both eyelids hooked open, blood and tears
          stream down his face, a gruesome sight.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Like the show so far?

                         (BEAT)
          Wait, it gets better.

                         STANLEY
          Please... Please... My eyes... I
          can't take it anymore... please...

                         JENNIFER
          Let me help you.
          Jennifer takes a slender knife from the bag. Working
          quickly, Jennifer guts a FISH.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Here, this might feel better.
          She leans in and smears the bloody fish guts onto Stanley's
          eyeballs.

                         STANLEY

          85 TNT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 85
          The water has filled up the trough and is overflowing. Andy
          struggles to lift his head up to draw a few quick breaths.
          Jennifer climbs onto his back and GRABS his hair pulling his
          head up.

                         JENNIFER
          Don't drown too soon.
          Andy tries to buck her off, gasping for breath, buckling
          under her added weight. Jennifer slams his head back into the
          water, and then up again... then down as she holds it.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hold it... hold it... hold it...
          Then she pulls his head back up as Andy spits water all over.

                         ANDY

                         (CHOKING)
          Fuck you... fuck you...

                         JENNIFER
          Now is that any way to talk to a
          lady?
          And back down with his head - it is exhausting to watch.
          WITH STANLEY: As a single CROW shows up by his head.
          He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing, but he
          can't move.
          ON THE MONITOR: The CROW has jumped onto Stanley's head -
          looking at his eyes -- It begins to peck at them. Stanley

          SCREAMS!

                         ON ANDY:
          Andy continues to struggle. A few seconds later, Jennifer
          returns, carrying a large bucket.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'm impressed. You got a lot of
          fight in you. Let's see how you do
          now.
          Jennifer brings forth the bucket.

                         ANDY
          Wha-- what is that?

                         JENNIFER
          oh, just some lye I found laying
          around.

                         ANDY
          Jesus, please, what the - no!
          Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy
          gag. But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does
          not want to put his face down.
          Jennifer come around in front of him.

                         JENNIFER
          Let's see how long you can keep
          that pretty little face of yours.
          Andy strains to keep his head faced at her.

                         ANDY
          Fuck you.

                         JENNIFER
          You already did that. I didn't
          enjoy it much. Now it's my turn to
          fuck you.
          Andy's neck is straining to keep his head out.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          That's an awfully big head you got.
          Your neck must be getting tired.
          Every vein in his neck now bulges. Andy's eyes start to
          water with tears.

                         ANDY

                         (STRAINED)
          Please...

                         JENNIFER
          Andy?

                         ANDY
          Wh--what...

                         JENNIFER
          Fuck you.
          Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He
          writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and

                         BURNING--

                         ANDY
          Ahhhhhhh!!!
          Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps,
          chokes and spits for his life as-
          STANLEY'S head is covered in crows.

          86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 86

          The crows jump all over pecking at Stanley's eyes, his cheeks
          - he is a bloody mess as he lets out a final guttural scream!

          A86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK A86

          Andy's body continues to writhe in pain. With yet another
          burst of strength he lifts his head out of the lye-bath
          revealing a face burnt red, puffy, oozing puss, skin flaking
          off and his eyes are a ghastly, milky white, pussy, and
          bloody.

          Finally his body stops convulsing. His head and midsection
          drop into the water. Blood seeps up the surface from his
          mouth.

          B86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY B86

          Stanley is dead. His one eye stares straight ahead. Where the
          other one should be, blood has poured all the way to the
          ground.

          C86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY C86

          Andy is dead.

          EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT

          The house is quiet now. A light bulb flickers from inside.

          B87 INT. SERVICE STATION - MORNING B87

          Johnny site at his desk, a phone planted to his ear.

                         JOHNNY
          .since when? Since last night...
          No Sheriff, I ain't heard from 'em.
          Johnny notices something in his small surveillance TV.
          ANGLE ON TV: A truck pulls up to the station, a hot woman in
          a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck. She pops the hood
          obscuring her once she does.
          Johnny sits up in his seat.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Look, like I said, as soon as
          dipshit or fuckface show up or call
          in, I'll let you know. ASAP. Now I
          got a customer.
          Johnny hangs up and walks out of the station.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 84.

          87 EXT. SERVICE STATION - MORNING 87

          A truck is parked at the pump. Its hood is up and a woman
          leans over the engine. Her ass is perfectly framed in a
          tight miniskirt, from which two, long flawless legs descend
          into a pair of blood-red high heels.
          Johnny walks over to her, wiping his hands on his bandana as
          the woman shimmies her hips, almost inviting him to approach
          her. And Johnny, being Johnny, doesn't need much.
          Johnny is close enough to touch her. He snickers a bit,
          never taking his eyes off her ass.

                         JOHNNY
          Can I fill it up for you, ma'am?
          The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny.
          Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he
          gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do
          anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right
          across the jaw.
          A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as
          Johnny falls face-first into the ground.

          88 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 88

          Johnny is buck-naked. His hands are tied tightly together
          and pulled above his head, running through an eye hook that
          has been screwed into one of the shack's wooden beams. His
          eyes flicker.
          Jennifer walks up to him, right to his face.

          JENNIFER (O.S.)
          It's date night.
          Johnny cranes his neck and twists his body to see who's there
          as Jennifer walks out of the shadows. She saunters up to
          Johnny.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Your mouth doesn't look so good.
          Maybe you should--
          With a massive TUG she pulls back on the bridle that bites
          into his raw, bloody mouth.

                         (SEDUCTIVELY)
          --Show me your teeth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 85.

                         JOHNNY

                         FTHUCKKK YOU--
          He grunts out a hellacious scream as his body bucks wildly.

                         JENNIFER
          Oooh, you're an ornery stallion,
          aren't you?
          Jennifer tilts her head and looks at him, as you would a
          fascinating piece of art.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.

                         JOHNNY
          Bithh...
          With a bunch of teeth missing, Johnny's lisp is pronounced.
          Jennifer saunters around him seductively. She removes
          something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair
          of pliers.
          Jennifer steps closer.

                         JENNIFER
          Oh, that's the problem. You still
          have some teeth left. We're gonna
          have to fix that.
          Jennifer clamps the.pliers down tightly on Johnny's tooth.
          He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his
          mouth and the pressure on the tooth, it's sheer agony.
          Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side, squeezing the
          tooth as hard as she can in the pliers. Finally, the root
          breaks free of the pulp and Johnny's tooth is extracted.
          Johnny flails around in severe agony.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Save your strength. You got a few
          more races to run.
          Johnny screams something unholy. Jennifer holds the tooth up
          in the air and inspects it.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I have to admit, I didn't think it
          went that far down.
          Jennifer sticks the pliers in again, latching it onto another
          tooth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 86.
          Johnny's eyes bulge with fear as he kicks and screams pulling
          his shackles taut --
          Jennifer rips down on the pliers - her face is splattered
          with blood as the tooth comes free.
          Jennifer discards the tooth and goes right back--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         PLEATH--
          As Jennifer begins to extract yet another tooth, Johnny's
          weary body convulses in so much pain that he actually pisses
          himself.

                         JOHNNY
          Pleath...for the loth oth thod,

                         JENNIFER
          That's disgusting. Even your boys
          didn't piss themselves. Be a man,
          will you?!
          Jennifer takes the bridle and yanks Johnny's around, the pain
          is so bad he can hardly fight. He grimaces and spits out a
          mouthful of blood at her.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Now that's not gonna get you a
          sugar cube.

                         JENNIFER
          We'll get to that.
          Jennifer pulls out a gun.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (SING SONG)
          Look who's here. My boyfriend.
          Remember him?
          She takes the gun and caresses it across his face, his chin,
          and then she SHOVES it in and out of his mouth.

                         (BEAT)
          Like you really mean it.
          Johnny finds renewed strength and starts to buck and writhe.
          ABOVE: The eye hook is starting to pull loose.
          With every touch of motion, white-hot pain courses through
          Johnny's body.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Breathe through your nose. It
          helps. You know, like it was your
          first time.
          Johnny's body flails with all his might as-
          ABOVE: The eye hook loosens a bit more--

                         JOHNNY

                         (SPITTING BLOOD)

                         WHORE--

                         JENNIFER
          I hear sometimes a stallion can get
          a little headstrong. They don't
          want to be trained... refuse to be
          broken...

                         (BEAT)
          But everyone has their breaking
          point, don't they?

                         (BEAT)
          You just have to find it. There's
          a way to break any animal. Do you
          know how they do that with horses?
          Do you, Johnny? I do.
          She walks away from Johnny and picks up the rusted old
          gardening sheer.
          She walks back to Johnny, menacingly slicing the sheer
          open... closed.. And again...

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You slice off every ounce of their
          foul manhood.
          She slices it closed again.
          As Jennifer closes in, the look in Johnny's face says it all.
          But there is simply nothing he can do about it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 88.
          Jennifer gets even closer, looking at Johnny's eyes as she
          reaches down towards his penis--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You geld them.
          SLICE! - Johnny's eyes rolls back as he SCREAMS!!!!
          She holds the piece of limp, pink flesh in her hand.
          Despite everything he's been through, this brings forth an
          entirely new level of pain. He screams and bucks as the
          EYEHOOK continues to loosen.
          Jennifer bends down for a moment, bringing something up from
          the floor. She comes back to a screaming Johnny as she--

          SHOVES HIS CASTRATED PENIS INTO HIS MOUTH.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          No teeth show horse... no teeth.
          Johnny flails with all his might, screaming, spitting as--
          ABOVE: The eye hook finally gives way. Johnny's tied hands
          come crashing down directly on top of Jennifer.
          Jennifer goes flying with a bloody enraged Johnny now free as
          he grabs and claws after her.
          Jennifer desperately kicks and scratches to get away from
          this hideous, blood-soaked monster - but Johnny grabs hold
          onto her leg - he drags her closer as she loses her grip--
          With one solid kick, Jennifer connects with Johnny in the
          face - he sprawls out from pain - as she gets up and races
          out the door - Slamming it closed as she exits. She leans up
          against it holding it closed.

          89 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 89

          Within seconds the door is kicked at, banged at, punched at -
          Johnny screams wildly from inside as-- Jennifer holds it shut
          with all her strength.
          Slowly the cries and banging fade until there is nothing but
          silence.
          Slowly she slides down on her bottom... exhausted, spent and
          completely devoid of all emotion.

          90 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 90

           HIGH ANGLE on Johnny. His lifeless body lays on the floor
           surrounded by a pool of blood.

          91 INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 91

           Sheriff Storch drives through town. He scans each side of
           the street. His phone rings.
          He picks it up and answers it.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Hi, honey.

          MRS. STORCH
          What's wrong?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Nothing, why?

          92 INT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - DAY(INTERCUT W/ABOVE) 92


          MRS. STORCH
          Why? Because I can hear it in your
          voice, that's why.
          Sheriff Storch laughs. She knows him too well.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Long day, that's all.

          MRS. STORCH (ON SCREEN)
          Well, perk up. Chastity's new
          teacher is here.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Mrs. Novick?

          MRS. STORCH
          No, for the honors program. Do you
          remember anything?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Oh yeah, okay.

          MRS. STORCH
          Yeah, just moved here from the

          Sheriff Storch GRUNTS. He doesn't find it so nice.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Well, I'll be home when I can.
          Busy today. if I don't make it,
          send her my regards.
          Sheriff Storch ends the call.
          Two seconds later the phone rings again. He looks at it,
          annoyed, answers.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I said I'd be there as soon as --

                         CHASTITY
          Hey daddy! Where are you?

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (ANNOYED)
          I already told your mother,
          Chastity. I'm working. I'll do my
          best to get home.

                         CHASTITY
          But I really want you to meet my
          new teacher. She is way cool.
          Sheriff Storch rolls his eyes.

                         CHASTITY (CONT'D) 
          Here, just say hi. 
          Chastity hands the phone over to - JENNIFER HILLS - who is
          sitting comfortably on the sofa next to Chastity, her hand
          embracing the little girl. 

                          

                         JENNIFER
          Howdy, Sheriff. 

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Hi. It's truly an honor to speak
          with you Miss...

          Sheriff Storch's face contorts upon hearing the name.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Excuse me?

                         JENNIFER
          I have to tell you, it's really
          been a pleasure meeting your
          family. You have a wonderful
          daughter with a bright and
          promising future.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          What the fuck do you think you're
          doing!--

                         JENNIFER
          We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          No - wait--
          But the call ends.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Chastity! ... Chastity!
          Sheriff Storch throws the phone to the ground and slams on
          the gas.

          93 EXT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - DAY 93

          The squad car screeches to a stop right in front of Sheriff
          Storch's house.
          Hearing the commotion, Mrs. Storch walks out onto the porch.
          She's almost knocked to the ground as her husband comes
          barreling up the steps.

          MRS. STORCH
          What is --
          Sheriff Storch grabs his wife's shoulders.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Chastity, where is she?!
          Mrs. Storch has absolutely no idea what is going on. In her
          mind, their daughter couldn't be in better hands.

          MRS. STORCH (CONT'D)
          She wanted to get to know her
          students in the program before the
          year started.
          Sheriff Storch lets go of his wife.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Goddamnit!

          MRS. STORCH

                         (GROWING CONCERN)
          Who is she? Who is this woman?
          He turns and runs back to his squad car, gets inside, and
          pulls away even faster than he came.

          94 EXT. PARK - DAY 94

          The squad car skids to a stop on the grass of the park. It's
          a modest recreation area that has seen better days.
          Sheriff Storch jumps out of the car, still leaving it
          running, and sprints into the park.
          A few feet away, an empty swing blows gently in the breeze.
          The metal brackets screech loudly with every movement.
          Sheriff Storch spins around in circles, a maelstrom of
          confusion. He looks around frantically for anything that
          will give him a clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter.

          95 INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 95 

          Sheriff Storch gets back inside. He immediately picks up the
          CB. But just as he opens his mouth to speak, lie glances in
          the rearview mirror. His eyes meet Jennifer's.
          Before he can turn, Jennifer pistol whips him in the temple.
          He falls forward, his head smacking into the steering wheel.
          The HONKING of the horn echoes throughout the empty park.

          96 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 96

          Sheriff Storch comes to. Blood trickles down from the side of
          his head.
          He's bent over the table, pants at his ankles. His SHOTGUN
          propped up behind him with the barrel inserted into his ass.
          With every move, a scorching pain courses through his body.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ahhhhhh!
          Jennifer walks over to the table and rests her elbow on it.
          Sheriff Storch speaks through gritted teeth.

                         JENNIFER
          Does that hurt? Come on, I thought
          you were an ass man, Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Where is she, you bitch?
          Jennifer slams the gun deeper. The Sheriff's body goes stiff.
          The Sheriff screams again.

                         JENNIFER
          I'd be careful how you speak to me
          at the moment, Sheriff. (BEAT)
          By "she," I assume you mean your
          daughter?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          What'd you do to her?

                         JENNIFER
          She really is lovely, Sheriff. So
          young. So sweet. I mean, can you
          imagine?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Imagine what?

                         JENNIFER
          Imagine if someone had done this to
          her.
          Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff. She wraps her fingers
          around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in, deeper.
          The Sheriff's expression is one of unbridled agony. Jennifer
          continues to sodomize him with the shotgun.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Someone like Andy?

                         (HARDER)
          Or Stanley?

          Two squad cars, SIRENS BLARING, speed down the road.

          Jennifer as she takes a spool of fishing line and walks
          straight across the room.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (FRANTIC)
          Please, she's just an innocent girl.

                         JENNIFER
          So was I.
          She gets to the corner of the room where a hulking figure
          site tied up in a burlap sack. Jennifer removes it revealing
          a dead MATTHEW... or is he?
          She ties the line to Matthews wrist. The other end is tied
          onto the shotgun's trigger.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (DESPERATE)
          You're not going to get away.

                         JENNIFER
          Neither are you.

          99 EXT. DIRT ROAD - DUSK 99

          The SQUAD CARS pull off and park as the DEPUTIES grab guns
          and race off into the woods.

          100 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 100

          Matthew stirs a bit as he starts to come to.

                         JENNIFER
          He'll be waking up soon. If I were
          you, I'd tell him not to move.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          (pained to talk)
          I'm begging you. Don't do this.
          We can figure something out.
          Matthew stirs again.

           "It was fun while it lasted".

          The Deputies converge on the SHACK, guns drawn.

          102 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 102

          Sheriff Storch tries to wriggle free - but every move he
          makes is the most painful experience imaginable.
          Matthew continues to stir awake, his eyes flutter open.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Matthew don't!--
          But it's too late - a startled Matthew jumps back--

                         MATTHEW
          --Sheriff!
          BANQ/// Matthew is splattered with blood, and body parts.

          103 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 103

          The Deputies react as the gun shot rings out through the
          area. They KICK the door in to see--

          104 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 104

          Matthew's crouched in a ball on the floor, covered in blood,
          the Sheriff, blood sprayed across the table, eyes wide open,

          DEAD.

          105 EXT. WOODS - DUSK 105

          Jennifer walks off as the sounds of the last remnants of the
          echoing gunshot fade into nothing. Jennifer doesn't miss a
          beat. She continues to walk off.

          a disturbed, psychotic, babbling mess.

          Jennifer turns to the dilapidated shack. in the distance she
          sees the officers escorting a handcuffed Matthew out.
          SLOW MOTION: As Matthew is wildly kicking and screaming in a
          furious panic. The Officers try to subdue him.
          Jennifer just stares, devoid of emotion. Then, after a
          minute, she turns and continues to walk off into the woods.
          ON JENNIFER: As she continues to walk away - and then - as
          she continue closer to CAMERA - the smallest hint of a wry
          smile - nearly imperceptible, but it's there, creeps across
          her face.

          THE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSE

          EXT. GI'S POINT

          We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
          A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
          first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
          laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
          hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
          younger, in hot pursuit.
          Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
          apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
          people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.

                         CLOSER NOW
          We see them in glimpses:
          Their eyes - Lips - Hands
          Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
          She reaches out and strokes his hand.
          He stares at their fingers mingling together.
          The woman sighs.

                         WOMAN
          I Love it here.
          I know you do...

                         WOMAN
          I can feel my life - ya know.
          He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les.
          A legend appears: Il -_ 1
          THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:

          A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and
          disappears down a long stretch of road. "And that's it from

          EXT. EMERSON ROAD - S

          The truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year
          old clapboard two-story affairs.

          EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - S

          Standing. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from
          the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually
          with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who
          are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son
          JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in
          his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
          The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,
          early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his
          face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a
          kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.
          The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is
          in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his
          day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.
          Natalie smiles back.

                         NATALIE
          Morn'in Dr. Fowler.

                         MATT
          Morn'in Natalie. How you doing boys?

                         JASON
          Great!
          Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy
          climbs inside the cab.
          Frank kneels down to Duncan.

                         F
          Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not
          coming?
          Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder.
          Duncan pulls away.
          Frank looks up to Natalie for help.

                         F
          He can come if he wants ...we can manage,
          really.
          She smiles and shakes her head.

                         NATALIE
          ahead. He wants to stay here.

                         F
          Don't worry Dunk. You can come next time.
          ,Qy
          Natalie kisses him and they're off.

          INTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVING
          Jason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of
          hero :worship in his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          I NT. STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWN
          Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their
          journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into
          cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we
          will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS.

          I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN
          A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their
          bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning
          small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs
          to their equipment, and so on.
          A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been
          used as a scratch pad for years.
          Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.

          EXT. HARBOR - SAME

          A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The
          bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with
          the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
          - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
          the shoes pick up the pace.

          EXT. HARBOR - S

          Matt & Frank prepare the rig.
          Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of
          LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
          collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
          stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
          exotic.
          Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built
          lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.

                         F
          C'mon up Jace.

                         MATT
          Hold on a second. Need to know if he's
          ready first - Jason, can you tell me
          what's important?
          Jason hesitates.

                         F
          on tell h°

                         JASON

                         (NERVOUS)
          "A shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark
          afternoon, a note in music--

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         L
          He takes a breath.

                         JASON
          and the way the back of a baby's neck
          smells if its mother keeps it tidy."

                         MATT

                         (TO FRANK)
          You taught h' well.
          Jason beams.

                         MATT
          - come aboard sailor.
          Matt reaches down to give a hand up.
          Frank turns the engine over. It roars to life.

          EXT. HARBOR LATER

          The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.

                         JASON
          Thank you.

                         MATT
          Ever been over there?

                         JASON
          No sir.

                         MATT
          It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
          though. It's a city. They have electric
          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
          run by a computer When I lived there,
          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
          cars, can you believe that?

                         JASON
          How'd you get back?

                         MATT
          Off the island?
          Jason nods.
          We rowed.
          Matt smiles at the memory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5

                         MATT
          Then we got a little outboard. That was
          great. A seven and a half horsepower it
          was - we lived there until I was about
          your age - then we left and became
          "harbor people".
          Jason seems to be digesting this.

                         JASON
          I a "harbor person"?
          Matt hides a smile about to form.

                         MATT
          Yep, Jason - we all are.
          Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and
          doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.

                         F
          At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts
          back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
          GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
          LINE into the WINCH.
          A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
          opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
          tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
          and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
          is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
          Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
          surfaces.
          Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
          BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
          crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
          Jason stares at the disfigured creature.

                         MATT
          Oh boy you see what happened to
          this poor fel ow?

                         JASON
          .what?

                         MATT
          Well, the trap has nylon nets called
          heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
          lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
          inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
          escaping--you know the old saying "two's
          company three-s a crowd"?
          Jason nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MATT
          Well{ it's like that. You get more than
          two in a bedroom and chances are
          something like this is going to happen.
          That's why Frank can't leave these traps
          for more than a day.
          Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
          are black balls on both sides of the tail.

                         MATT
          Now the older females like this of gal,
          are the most dan erous - especially when
          they're growin' eyries.

                         JASON
          Berries?

                         MATT
          Eggs... .one of these can take out two
          males easy - Then you wind up with
          lobster you can't sell - and as for this
          fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
          says you have to let her go.
          Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.

                         TT
          Can you handle this?
          Jason nods.

                         MATT

                         (GENTLY)
          You sure?
          He really isn't. Matt hands it to him.

                         MATT
          Go ahead now, put it in the tank.
          Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.

          EXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY

          Looking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is
          manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in
          their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape,
          post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful,
          d you on't freeze in the winter.
          The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops
          the gate. Resting on the bed is a LARGE BOX wit a line drawing
          of a SWING-SET.

                         Q

          FRANK O.S.
          Hey, dad can you give me a hand?
          The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. FOWLER BACKYARD LATER

          Frank pushes Duncan, who sits proudly on his new swing-set.

                         D C
          Higher! HIGHER!
          SMALL CHILDREN are everywhere. A serious Super Soaker Squirt
          Gun fight in progress.

          ACROSS THE YARD
          a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs &
          burgers. A spatula flips a patty.
          The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able
          radio.
          WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works
          the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for
          forty plus years.
          Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches
          through a plastic bread bag.
          Willis looks past him, distracted.

                         MATT
          h, Ruth hates this kind.
          What?

                         MATT
          I bought the wrong buns.

                         WILLIS
          Maybe we can borrow hers.
          Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction:
          A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe
          the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap).

                         WILLIS
          Ah, what I would give to have back my
          youth.

                         MATT
          Willis, you never had that in your youth.
          The woman turns around and catches Willis staring. It's
          Natalia.
          Willis looks down, nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag.
          Matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts, FATHER OBERTI,

                         50-S-

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MATT
          Father! You made it!

                         FATHER OBERTI
          Hey, if I don't see you fellas here, I
          don't get to see you at all.

                         ON F
          He backwards-hugs Natalie.

                         F
          You want a beer?

                         NATALIE
          I think I'll see if your Mom needs any
          help.

                         FRANK
          Good luck.
          She laughs-He grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and
          escapes inside the house.
          Matt watches on, and falls into a wistful daydream.

                         WILLIS
          Jealous?
          Matt turns to him and, to Willis's surprise, ever so slightly,
          nods.

          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - S
          Natalie walks in through the living room, pausing to examine
          a half finished ARCHITECTURAL MODEL that sits on a card-table
          next to a jigsaw puzzle.
          She looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink.
          She takes a breath and starts there.

          I NT. FOWLER GARAGE - DAY

          OF THE GE
          Frank reaches into an old Westinghouse refrigerator. He pulls
          out a case of Schaeffer's and a six-pack of Moxie. He loads it
          all into a metal tub filled with ice.

          Over the left sply TIM. A hair-net nests on his head.

          So, Mr. Strout mentioned you again.

                         FRANK
          I bet he did.

                         TIM
          Seriously, man. He still talks about you
          coming back. Says you're the best can
          packer he ever had.
          Be nods.

                         F
          He always was a nice guy.

                         TIM

                         (EXHAUSTED)
          Are we there yet?
          Tim and Frank emerge from the side of the house. Willis cuts
          them off, grabs two beers.

                         WILLIS
          Excuse me boys - an offering. Catch
          Father.
          He throws one to Father Oberti who sits talking with Willis's wife
          KATIE GRINNEL 50's, she is tal ing the priest's ear off.

          Becky went to the hairdressing academy
          after high school, but aft she got
          married and had the boys, she decided she
          wanted to stay home - she still loves
          doing hair though. Where do you go
          Father?

                         FATHER OBERTI
          I just go to Super Cuts.

                         KATIE
          You can't request the same girl at Super
          Cuts - you have to take what you can get.
          They don't know your hair - how can you
          get a good cut i they don't know the
          air?
          Father Oberti has the patience of...well,of a priest.

          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY
          RUTH FOWLER 50, attractive, is washing and arranging
          vegetables on a plate. Natalie chops carrots on a cutting
          board.
          They barely make eye-contact. Natalie attempts small talk.

                         RUTH
          Can you hand me that bowl dear?
          She does.

                         RUTH
          Thank you.

          I'm looking forward to the concert on
          Labor day. The music is so...unusual
          haunting really..
          Ruth keeps chopping. Natalie chooses her words carefully.

                         NATALIE
          How did you learn about that particular
          style?

                         RUTH
          At Faro y thesis was on Eastern
          European .folk music.
          Natalie's lips tighten uncomfortably. The topic seems to int° date.

                         (LIGHTLY)
          I thought o becoming a teacher.

                         RUTH
          Why didn't you?
          The answer to Ruth's question (Duncan) wanders in. His cheeks
          as big as Dizzy Gillespie's.

                         NATALIE
          What are you eating?
          Duncan's mouth is so full he can hardly speak.

                         DUN
          .nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The two regard each other

                         NATALIE
          How is it?

                         D C

                         (SMILING)
          Good.
          He tugs on her shirt.

                         D C
          Swing me, Swing me.

                         NATALIE
          Okay, okay Dunk...
          She gets dragged out of the kitchen. The screen door slams.
          Ruth finishes arranging the plate. Matt enters, and starts
          opening up the cupboards loo
          king for something.
          He squats down, burrowing into a cabinet.

                         MATT
          It was nice of you to invite the boys.

                         RUTH
          She hasn't brought them before because
          she's embarrassed. She shouldn't be
          embarrassed.
          Matt looks up from the floor.

                         MATT

                         (TO RUTH)
          Nice view from down here.

          I don't know why you had to put that
          monstrosity up. You're just going to have
          to take it apart when they leave.
          Matt rises, a bottle of lighter fluid in hand.

                         MATT
          C'mon, Ruth, he's a kid. What did you
          expect? "Happy Birthday, here's a box.
          why don't you drag it around for a while?"
          He s a kid. He wants it now.
          Something across the yard catches her attention.

                         RUTH
          Oh, no.

          Duncan jumps off his swing and sprints.

                         TO RICHARD
          who has just arrived. He stays at the far end of the yard.
          Duncan does a running jump into his father's arms.

          Daddy!
          Frank with Jason, looks up.
          Jason sees his father. He doesn't move.
          Natalie walks over to Frank, they exchange glances.

          Richard, eating Duncan's hot dog, rises to meet Natalie and
          Jason.

          Jason reaches over and whacks Duncan on the head.

                         RIC

                         (ANGRY)
          Hey Jason - Don't do that to your
          brother. You want me to do that to you?
          He probably has. Jason backs away.
          Frank makes his way over to Natalie.

          AT THE GRILL
          Matt watches on- absently flipping burgers.

                         IT'S OK-
          Ruth shakes her head.
          Richard, Frank and Natalie are talking, but there are long pauses
          between words. Tim wanders over and says something to Richard
          Finally, Richard smiles, turns, and exits. Alone.
          Jason playfully chases Duncan across the yard.
          Frank and Natalie stay behind, talking quietly.
          Matt takes a breath, and exhales. He turns to Ruth with a
          comforting smile, but
          she's just entering the house. The screen door closes behind
          her.

          The first film we ever saw together.

          THE SOUND OF PISTOL FIRE.

          INT. STRAND THEATER - NIGHT

          Matt & Ruth sit watching BARRY L DON. The duel between Barry
          Lord Bullingdon is on screen. Bullingdon's pistol misfires.

                         LORD BULLINGDON
          Sir Richard this pistol must be faulty -
          I must have another.

          AIDE TO RIC
          I'm sorry Lord Bullingdon but you must
          first stand your ground and allow Mr.
          Lyndon his turn to fire.

                         SIR RIC
          That is correct Lord Bullingdon - your
          pistol has fired and that counts as your
          shot--Mr. Lyndon are the rules of firing
          clear to you?

                         YES -

                         SIR RICHARD
          Lord Bullingdon are you rsdy to receive
          Mr- Lyndon's fire?

                         LORD BULLINGDON
          -.o yes -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15

                         SIR RIC
          very well then - Mr. Lyndon cock your
          pistol and prepare to fire.
          Bullingdon is overwrought. He looks like he may vomit.
          Ruth leans over to Matt.

                         RUTH
          Let's go.
          Ruth gets out of her seat. Matt looking confused follows.

          EXT. STRAND THEATRE - S

          Ruth heads out the doors with Matt on her heels.

                         MATT
          What's wrong?

                         RUTH
          I don't remember it being so tragic.

                         MATT
          O h h always felt sorry for Barry.

                         RUTH
          Please.

                         MATT
          No, I mean it - maybe I relate to him.

                         RUTH
          What are you talking about?

                         MATT
          Well, we both married above our station.

                         RUTH
          Don't start that again.
          A moment. He takes her in his arms and kisses her. Looks into
          her eyes.

                         MATT
          Happy anniversary.

                         RUTH

                         (SMILES)
          Happy anniversary.
          He buries his face in her hair.

                         9 G

                          MATT ` RUTH

          ritual of removing the pins from her hair once ma e from the
          shells of tortoises and now the plastics of Dupont.
          Matt lies in bed reading. He lowers his book and watches her
          brush her tresses with on y, delicious strokes. She sets down
          her bsh and turns. Matt ooks back to his book.
          She climbs into bed next to him.

                         RUTH
          She's not divorced yet.

                         MATT
          It's the same thing. Maine has crazy
          laws, that's all...he likes the boys.

                         RUTH
          You don't think he's thinking about-

                         TT
          No...he's not going to marry her.

                         RUTH
          Then what's he doing with her?

                         MATT
          She probably loves him, Ruth. Girls
          always have. Why can't we just leave it
          at that?

                         RUTH
          Hmmmm. He won't listen to me. I asked him
          three times to dismantle that swing-set.

                         MATT
          Oh, let it stay up. Looks like a young
          couple lives here.

                         RUTH
          He needs his head in school. Not in her.

                         MATT
          So to speak.
          Ruth pinches his shoulder.

                         RUTH
          it would help if you were my side.

                         MATT

                         (PLAYFULLY)
          I'll get on your side.
          She laughs and pushes him away.

                         MATT
          You can put your shirt back on now.
          Alma stands and helps her husband dress.
          Yesterday he was up and around all
          afternoon, but toda - he tumbled. He's
          fallen down twice. have all I can do to
          get him up. He's weak and the longer you
          lay in bed - the weaker you get.

                         MATT
          Elwyn, you need to do those exercises,
          you promised me, twice a day.
          I know you miss the work -
          important. but it's

                         ALMA

                         TO MATT)
          Man idn't have ache nor pain--he's just
          gave up-said when he couldn't work no
          more, he didn't want to live. For a while
          he'd sit and just mend on nets - but he
          can't do that anymore.

                         ELWYN
          (speaks with difficulty)
          How's your dad Matt?
          I'm sorry Dr. now Elwyn you remember
          Jesse Fowler passed on somi&ime back, we
          were at the funeral. Remember?
          Elwyn nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         18
          Matt knows. He's heard this before. Sometimes he feels more like
          a mechanic than a doctor, working on old cars with parts that
          have long been discontinued. He nods sympathetically.

          INT. MATT'S OFFICE HALLWAY LATER

          Matt pulls on his jacket. He passes Janelle in the hallway as
          he heads for the back door.

                         MATT
          I'll be back in an hour. Forgot my lunch.

                         JANELLE
          Starting to become a habit. I can get you
          something from Willis's.
          He's already out the door.

          EXT. HARBOR - SAME

          Matt trots down the gangway and up to where the "GIGI" is
          moored. He looks in. No sign of Frank. A VOICE BOOMS from a
          new 35ft. JONESPORTER - it belongs to HENRY OZAR 50's.

                         HENRY
          Just missed him Matt, he went home for
          lunch today.

                         MATT
          Right ...I forgot he's got that interview.

          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY
          Matt enters. Looks around. Calls up the stairs.

                         MATT
          Frank? Frank? Hello?

          FRANK O.S.
          Dad.
          Matt turns around, and sees Frank,

                         MATT
          Frank? .. What are you doin ? Thought you
          were driving to Boston for t at
          interview?
          rank slowly nos. His clothes are rumpled.

          FRANK V Q°
          yeah - he we rescheduled.

                         MATT

                         (KNOWING)
          uh huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         19
          NATALIE - walks out, from a room in the hall. She combs her
          hair through with her fingers, but her skirt, on backwards, is
          somewhat of a giveaway.
          Frank rolls his eyes.

                         NATALIE
          Hello, Dr. Fowler.

                         MATT
          Hi, where are the boys?

                         NATALIE

                         (SHEEPISHLY)
          .with my mom.
          Then.

                         MATT

                         (TO NATALIE))
          oh-Like coleslaw?

          THE KITCHEN TABLE
          Matt sits across from Natalie and Frank. Sandwiches, iced tea
          and coleslaw are laid out.
          Frank looks to Matt for some kind of acknowledgement of his
          lunch-t°e activities. Matt seems more interested in the slaw.

          EXT. ELK'S FIELD - DAY


                         BLEACHERS
          Frank is sandwiched between Matt and Ruth. They are surrounded
          by dozens of young parents.
          Ruth doesn't look too tilled to be here.

                         FRANK
          Wave you guys.
          Matt and Ruth follows Frank's gaze, to:

                         DOWN BELOW
          Natalie has her hands full adjusting Jason's uniform while
          Duncan clings to her. She is waving up to the Fowlers amidst
          the chaos.

          THE BLEACHERS.
          The Fowlers wave back.

          %Q,
          Matt 's suddenly inspired. He leans in past Ruth, to Frank.

                         MATT
          Did you tell your Mom how good it was?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         20

                         RUTH
          How good what was?

                         MATT
          Frank had quite a time this afternoon
          Loved your coleslaw. Ate enough for two.

                         RUTH
          That's what it's there for...
          Frank leans back behind Ruth to give his father the evil eye.
          He gets a grin from Matt for his trouble. Ruth almost catches
          it.
          Matt rises, shuffles past Ruth and Frank, whom he gives a firm
          pat on the knee.
          Hot dogs?

                         FRANK
          I'll take one.
          Ruth puts her arm around Frank.

                         RUTH
          (re: Duncan and Jason)
          So, how are the kids?
          Frank's caught off- guard. He shakes his head.

                         RUTH
          . things okay?

                         F
          Fine.

                         RUTH
          Good, good.
          Then.

                         RUTH
          How'd your interview go?

                         F

                         (TOO FAST)
          Great.

                         RUTH
          Oh, good.
          Ruth watches Natalie below.

                         RUTH
          She's such a brave girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2

                         F
          That's it. You' re driving e nuts, Ma.
          Really. I've had lots of girlfriends.

                         F
          I don't understand why this one is any
          different.

                         RUTH
          I know you don't.

                         FRANK
          Were not serious, Mom.

                         RUTH
          No?

                         F
          No. It's a summer thing.
          She would like to believe him.

                         RUTH
          I see.

          INT. NATALIE'S CAR - DAY

          Natalie drives down Emerson Road.
          As she approaches her house, she sees a Brown Suburban sitting
          in her driveway. She looks confused.

          INT. NAT IE'S HOUSE - DAY


                         THE KITCHEN
          Natalie enters with groceries.
          Richard is seated at the kitchen table. He's finishing the first half
          of a sandwich. He drains a glass of milk.
          Natalie sets her purse down on the counter, and starts cleaning
          up his mess.

                         NATALIE
          How'd you g et in this time?

                         RIC

                         (PLAYING ALONG)
          chimney.
          She takes the carton of milk that Richard, no doubt, left out. She pours
          the final drops into his glass

                         RIC
          Thank you.
          She throws the carton out. She takes a seat, and stares at him
          like a teacher counselling a troubled youth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         22

                         NATALIE
          What can I help you with?
          He kicks back the last of the milk, wipes his mouth.

                         RIC
          I was just dropping that off for Jason.

                         NATALIE
          What?

                         RIC
          That.
          He points to a BASEBALL TROPHY sitting on top of the microwave.
          inscription bears his name and "Rockland High School 1982
          Regional Championship."

                         RIC
          I didn't know where you'd want to put it.
          It was about time he got it. What am I
          going to do with it?
          Richard's wistful gaze stays locked on the trophy.
          For a moment, Natalie's and slips away.

                         NATALIE
          I think it will mean a lot to him,
          Richard. He's really been improving
          lately ...

                         RIC
          (a sharp turn)
          So I've heard.

                         NATALIE
          It would have been nice if you'd come to
          his game.

                         RIC
          I just got your message. Where are t
          with him?

                         NATALIE
          That's none of your business.

                         RIC
          I see. They're my kids but they're none of
          my business.

                         NATALIE
          You know what I mean.

                         E-??
          Richard presses his fingers to his eyes. He takes a long, heavy
          breath.

                         RIC
          I - - I was thinking about moving back.
           Here. With you and the boys.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         23

                         NATALIE
          What are you talking about?

                         RIC
          What I talking about? I'm talking about
          moving back, that's what I'm talking
          about - I know what you're thinking, but
          it's different now.

                         NATALIE
          Oh reall ? How's the job? Your father
          t ake you back on at the cannery?

                         RIC

                         (DRILY)
          That's funny. You're still getting checks
          aren't you?
          She ignores him

                         RICHARD
          Ya see my new rig out there?
          Natalie looks annoyed.

                         NATALIE
          Yeah - it's real nice.

                         RIC
          It's not exactly new, I traded David the truck
          for it. It's got room for all of us - a good
          grocery gettin car.
          A moment.

                         RIC
          You wantta take a ride?

                         NATALIE

                         (LAUGHING)
          Jesus - you don't change, do you?.

                         RIC
          Change? No, I don't change. Everything
          around me changes. You change. You take my
          house, you take my kids, you fuck this
          other y- No, I don't change at all.

                         NATALIE
          It's not your house.

                         RIC
          Oh- No?
          NAT I o?
          No- And as far as fucking oes - .who was it
          that answered your phone t %e other morning?

                         RIC
          She...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2-

                         NAT IE
          I don't care. Really, you can just stop
          now. It's not working.
          He takes a breath.

                         RIC
          I just want.. -a chance.

                         NATALIE
          For what? To fool them for a few days into
          thinking they have a real father, and then
          it's back to

                         RIC
          (cutting her off)
          I their father.

                         NATALIE

                         (VEHEMENT)
          No, Richard. You know what defines a
          father? It's what he does, not what he
          promises. It's being a positive,
          consistent presence.
          Richard eyes her suspiciously. 13

                         RIC
          (mimicking ° her )
          "Positive consistent presence." Wow. What
          does that mean? I just don't get it. But
          I'm not fucking a college boy, am I?

                         NATALIE
          Look ...can you just go now? I really don't
          want you here when they get back.

                         RIC
          Oh, no, wouldn't want that.
          He doesn't budge.

                         NATALIE
          You have to leave.
          Finally, as if struck b some small discove . Richard places
          his large hands on the kitchen table and pus es himself up.
          He heads past Natalie without looking back. He closes the door
          firmly be ind him.

          'I. NAT IE' S HOUSE - FRONT YARD -,RUSK
          Frank's truck parked out front
          The lawn is littered with the boy's various plastic weapons
          a small wading pool.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         25
          A children's television show is heard from inside.
          Natalie is sprawled out on a chaise lounge, nursing a beer, and
          sharing a cigarette with Frank, who is on his hands & knees
          finishing an elaborte structure with a set of FROEBEL wooden
          blocks.

                         NATALIE
          You know I've been ignoring our
          difference in age, but if you keep
          playing with those blocks, I'm gonna
          start to worry.

                         F
          They're not blocks - they're gifts.

                         NATALIE
          I'm sorry I know they're a gift and a
          very generous one. I'm gust concerned
          that Dunk. might think e's a little old
          to be playing with them.

                         FRANK
          They're not for playing - they're to learn about
          unity & balance. Froebel called them "Gifts."
          This is the second gift - a sphere, a cube, and a
          cylinder. A five year old can learn the
          difference in form depending on how they look at
          them.
          Why didn't he say so in the first place?

                         NATALIE
          Oh ou said second gift. How many are
          are there?

                         FRANK
          Twenty.
          A moment.

                         NATALIE
          You've been pla in with these - excuse
          me, working wit t ese for how long?

                         F
          Since I was about Dunk's age. My mom took
          me tough all twenty.
          So that's what a good mother does.

                         NATALIE
          .oh.

                         FRANK ??0
          Come on down here and take a look.
          She sets down her beer and Joins him. The small wooden structure
          looks like a home that could have been built by Lautner or Wright
          Frank looks pleased. Natalie is distracted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         26

                         NATALIE
          Your Mother gave you these Frank - I feel
          funny Duncan having them.

                         F
          Don't be silly, it was her idea.

                         NATALIE

                         (SCEPTICAL)
          Really?

                         F
          You're not looking at the house - look.
          It's not all mine, it's part Mack.
          Frank speaks excitedly, as he makes a quick sketch on a colored
          piece of construction paper using one of the boys' markers.

                         F
          See the whole ideal of what Mack was
          trying to achieve was a common area in the
          middle of the house. I mean - a large,
          common space wasn't uni e to Mack, but
          the idea of separating the family so that
          the kids were on one side and the parents
          on the other, so they would all spill into
          the center ...
          He looks over to Natalie, checking in.
          She smiles, and shifts her gaze.

                         F
          I'm boring you, aren't I?

                         NATALIE

                         (SOFTLY)
          No, not at all, I was just... . just
          thinking.

                         F
          About what?

                         NATALIE
          About you. . ,school,

                         F
          I'd rather talk about our house.

                         NATALIE
          I know you would.

                         F
          What if I wait a year?

                         NATALIE

                         R

                         F
          A year's not going to make a difference.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         27

                         NATALIE
          You can't do that, Frank.

                         F
          I've thought a lot about this.

                         NATALIE
          But you told me it takes forever just to
          establish yourself.

                         F
          Exactl , so what's a year in forever?
          Know w at Duncan said today?
          She can't suppress a smile.

                         NATALIE
          You wouldn't be changing the subject
          would you?

                         FRANK
          Yes.

                         NATALIE
          What now?

                         F
          He said, "Frank, I don't think Jason
          really understands girls."

                         NATALIE

                         (LAUGHING)
          He didn't!

                         F
          He did ... "understands girls!"

                         NATALIE
          What did you say?

                         F
          I said, "give him time, Duncan."
          They both break up.

                         F
          I didn't know what to say! if this is how
          he is now - boy are we in trouble-
          He stops short. The word - We - hangs in the air. They watch each
          other, unsure of how to react. Changing the subject quickly. Frank
          reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan's toys. A
          real musclebound superhero. Somewhat grotesque.

                         F

          Richard gave it to Dunk for his birthday.

          The HEADLIGHTS OF APPROACHING CAR rake across ACTION

          I NT. ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT
          Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's
          classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess.
          The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of
          the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht
          bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s:
          This afternoon they were sw' °ng. A few look sleepy enough
          to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping
          time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings "The
          Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices.
          They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice."

                         CHORUS (SUBTITLED)
          Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool
          water. There is my dear village and in
          that village, the prettiest girl.
          Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their
          ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are
          normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a
          place of pure self. The song ends.

                         RUTH
          That was really good! OK it's 7:30
          we should stop.
          The girls gather up their things quickly.

                         RUTH
          Remember when you sing these words-
          The way we feel about the harbor, is how
          the Balkans felt about the river Sava.
          The girls start out of the room.

                         RUTH
          Listen to your tapes "Moilih Tan is still
          very rough and we've of a 40 minute
          program to get ready by Labor Day.

          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - NIGHT - LIVINGROOM
          Ruth enters. She's beat. She starts to put her purse down, when

                         SHE NOTICES:
          Matt, kneeling in front of the reclining chair. It's back is to
          her.

                         MATT
          Just hold still ...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         29
          Ruth drops her purse and quickly comes around the recliner.
          Something stops her.

                         RUTH
          Oh my God.
          Matt holds Frank's jaw. He gently turns his face toward the
          lamp.
          Frank has stitches over his right eye. The blood under the
          white of the pupil oozing. Both lips are bright and swollen.

                         F

                         DAD

                         MATT
          Come on, Frank. Hold still.
          Ruth hovers, in shock.

                         RUTH
          This was her husband, wasn't it?
          Frank nods wearily.

                         F
          Ex, he dropped in.
          He takes the compress from Matt and gingerly applies it to his
          forehead.

                         MATT
          Press charges.

                         F
          No.

                         RUTH
          What's to stop him from doing it again?

                         MATT
          Did you hit him at all? Tell me you hit
          him! Enough so he won't want to next time?

                         F
          I don't think I touched him.
          Matt pulls up the skin around the bloody eye.

                         F
          ! Jesus, Dad!
          Ruth stares at the Hospital band around Frank's wrist.

                         8 -`V

                         MATT
          So what are you going to do?

                         F

                         (SMILING)
          Take Karate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         30

                         RUTH
          That's not the problem.

                         F
          You know you like her.

                         RUTH
          I like a lot of people. What about the
          boys? Did they see it?

                         F
          They were asleep.

                         RUTH
          Did you leave her alone with him?

                         FRANK
          He left first. She was yelling at ham. I
          believe she had a skillet in her hand.

                         RUTH
          Oh for God's sake.

                         (TO MATT)
          Did you call the police?
          Not yet.

                         RUTH
          You didn't call them?

                         MATT
          When was I going to call the police, Ruth?
          He just got in.
          Ruth scans the room.

                         RUTH
          Where's the phone?

                         F
          MOM! hold on a second,
          Calm down. Let's just talk about this.
          Ruth wavers.
          Now the cops'll go to her place first --
          and it'll scare the hell out of the kids.

                         RUTH
          Matt.

                         I

          MATT %Q,
          We have to call them Frank.

                         F
          It wasn't that serious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         31

                         RUTH
          Of course. Just like the relationship
          isn't serious.

                         HATT
          Ruth, this is not the time.

                         RUTH
          Well, when is the time? After he knocks
          him into a coma? This is stopping. Now.

                         F
          Oh really?

                         RUTH
          Come Fall, you're on a plane. Are you
          taking them with you? How- do you think the
          boys will feel when you disappear?

                         F

                         HEY A

                         RUTH
          This isn't just some sweetie from Vassar,
          that you'll see on holidays, Frank.
          You're not in this alone.
          Frank rises and leaves the room.

                         RUTH
          Please listen. The sooner you end this
          thing the better.
          Ruth exhales.
          She returns to Matt, who is leaning against the recliner, chin
          in hand, deep in thought.

                         RUTH
          What are we going to do?
          Matt deliberates.

                         MATT
          I don't know.

                         RUTH
          .you've got to talk to him.

                         HATT
          I don't ow.,,I think he's right about
          scaring the kids. Why don't we call it a
          night? We'll deal with it tomorrow.

                         RUTH
          Matt are you going to call the police or
          do I have to?
          You just ..s- Bd me what I think. if you
          want to call them. call them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         32
          Ruth looks at him, stupefied.
          Without warning, Ruth leaves and goes upstairs.

          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Ruth lies on her side reading. Matt comes in from the
          hallway.
          He stares at her.
          She ignores him.
          Finally, she turns over and faces him.

                         RUTH
          It's not the first time she's played
          around.
          Matt seems relieved that she's talking to him. He sits on the
          bed and starts taking off his shoes.

                         MATT
          She's not with the guy anymore.

                         RUTH
          I mean from before.

                         MATT
          What are you talking about?

                         RUTH
          Oh, come on - you've heard the same
          things I have.

                         MATT
          I think you forget. I don't take my lunch
          in the teachers lounge -

                         RUTH
          Maybe he still loves her.
          Matt looks from Ruth, out the bedroom door, and into the
          hallway. He sees Frank rounding the top of the stairs.
          He gets up and closes the bedroom door.

          I NT. F R HOUSE F 'S ROOM - S
          Frank enters the room, pulls off his T-shirt and drops it on
          the floor. He walks over and faces a wall mirror. He seems
          nonplussed by what he sees.

          INTO HENRY'S FISH SHACK - DAY
          Henry Czar sits holding court with Jason Frank, whose facial
          bruises have all but healed, the stitches replaced by a
          butterfly bandage. They eat cod tongues and cheeks. Drink soda
          pop from bottles.

                         HENRY
          Best part of the cod - but most
          outsi ers, they won't touch it.
          The shack is too warm and smells of cordage and paint,
          spilled beer and male sweat. Jason is in heaven.

                         HENRY
          The summer fishermen, the part-timers,
          like Frank here - get in your hair.

                         HENRY
          There's as many as 80 of em with licenses
           now - should put up a sign - "Fish your
           own backyard or lose your traps0"
          Frank smiles at Jason.

                         FRANK
          A lobster is simple enough Jason. But if
          the guy going after him is even simpler
          well he might as well give up.

                         HENRY
          Don't hurt my feelings any. Easy to talk
          Try fishing in the winter, cold as hell
          10, 12, 20 below - no matter Go, go,
          go, you've gotta go. You want your bread
          & flour, you gotta goo

                         F
          Henry's just sore cause I catch twice as
          much as he does, with an old second hand
          Boudreau.

                         HENRY
          Don't you listen to him son - that boat
          is fine. She was my first.
          Takes a sip of pop.

                         HENRY
          Kinda miss her sometimes, and that truck
          you're driving .when you headed back to
          school Frank?-
          For some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they
          crack up. Not Jason, he seems concerned by the question.
          Frank sees this.

          EXT. GANGWAY - DAY

          Jason heads off down the pier on his bicycle. He passes Matto

                         JASON
          Hi, Dr. Fowler
          Matt waves.

          EXT. "GIGI" - S

          Frank is hosing down the hull, as Matt makes his way down the
          gangway.

                         MATT
          What'd you pull?
          Frank glances up, then continues with his work.

                         F
          Not too bad, about forty pounds.

                         MATT
          Haven't caught sight of you in days.

                         F
          You know where to find me.

                         MATT
          When you coming home?
          Frank turns off the spigot.

                         F
          Has it come to this?
          He jumps back into the boat and retrieves the bait bucket.

                         MATT
          Come to what?
          Frank hops back onto the dock and sets down the container.

                         F

                         (SMILES)
          You having to run errands for Mom.
          Matt ignores the jibe. Frank starts stacking holding crates.

                         F
          I'm thinking of building a couple hundred
          more traps - see if I can do better than
          break even.
          Matt doesn't comment. He picks up a crate and throws it up top.

                         MATT
          it'll take you two years to get a licence
          to fish off-season.

                         FRANK
          Right ...unless Henry takes me on as his
          ster an. % Q
          They continue stacking.

                         MATT
          You think he'd do that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         35

                         F
          Maybe ...it's as good a life as any. Good
          enough for your father - sometimes things
          skip a generation.

                         MATT
          (trying to sta calm)
          C'mon Frank - you ow ycu need something
          more.

                         F
          Why? So I can have an Ivy Lea e
          education like you? Christ, i it's so
          great - how come you sneak out of that
          office everyday to come down here?

                         MATT
          I like spending time with my son.

                         FRANK

                         A MOMENTA
          Frank lugs up the last container and takes a seat on the
          stack. He's worn out - takes a breather.
          Frank shakes his head.

                         FRANK

                         (PAINFUL)
          I don't know dad---I don't know.
          Matt takes a seat next to him.
          A moment.

                         F
          She's a wonderful girl ...I see that.
          Frank looks lost.
          The silence is broken by a loud voice.

          HENRY O.S.
          Franks how lon you gonna be parked there
          I'd like to un oad.
          The two of them regard each other.

                         (TO MATT)
          Give me a hand?

          The Dining room light is on.

                         THE DININGROOM
          Frank sits at the t lea His drafting tools are out. He's fully
          immersed in a sketch.
          Ruth enters quietly.

                         RUTH
          Your father is snoring. Don't mind me.
          She takes a container from the fridgge, smells it, makes a
          quenstioning face, then puts it back - grabs another container
          and opens a cupboard. Pulls out a loaf of bread.
          She quietly places a sandwich in front of him, and takes a
          seat.

                         RUTH
          Eat---you must be hungry.
          Frank doesn't look up. his tone is flat, removed.

                         F
          I'm not hungry.

                         RUTH
          Coffee?
          He doesn't answer. Ruth sits there, awkwardly.

                         RUTH
          So---you talked with her?

                         FRANK
          Yep.

                         WONDERFUL GIRL
          Frank finally puts down his pencil,',-and looks at her,

                         F
          You're not reall going to have this
          conversation wit me now, Ma? Are you?
          Frank returns to his work. He doesn't look up again.

          She leaves the food for him. Like a zoo keeper.

          EXT. HARBOR - DAY

          Frank hauls traps. He appears lethargic, dull - the hands a
          little slower. The eyes tired. The joy of the work, replaced by
          dread.

          INT. HENRY'S FISH SHACK - DAY

          Hen sits alone at the wooden table. There are three plates of cod,
          and 3 soda-pops. Frank comes in exhausted. Henry looks up.

                         HENRY
          You're nn'in late.
          Frank nods. Takes a seat, and starts in on the cod.
          Henry looks at the empty seat next to Frank.

                         HENRY
          Where's our boy?
          Frank ignores the question.

          INT. FRANK'S TRUCK - DAY

          Frank drives. Traps stacked in the bed.
          He slows down to gaze out his window, as he passes

          NAT IE' S HOUSE.
          The truck crawls to a stop.
          He takes the moment, storin each detail: Folded up lounge
          chairs. Scattered toys on t 9e porch. A tipped-over tricyle.
          He idles, as if waiting for someone. After one last look he
          drives off.
          I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - E. ...g
          The sightsand sounds of men gathered around a poker table. A
          regular game. Everyone well into their umpteenth beer, with
          the exception of Matt, who nurses a can o Moxien,
          Matt frowns at his hand. He glances over to
          Frank r also at the table. Frank stares at his cards, but his

          Carl, you've really got to get off this
          Blake thing ... you're in a rut.
          Frank tries to smile.

          Don't get him going Matt.

                         CARL

          It's OK Dunk .--Mommy's coming
          back.
          NATALIE hesitates - then heads out the door.
          We MOVE WITH HER out the bedroom to the,

          TOP OF THE STAIRS
          She slowly steps down the stairs.

          A GUNSHOT.

          She moves quickly down the stairs.

          Cautiously - she looks over the landing.
          HER P.O.V.: From above, Richard stands, his back to her, his head hung.
          in his hand. a 9mm Pistol.
          Natalie lets out a plaintive wail.

                         NATALIE

          NO...
          Emotionless, Richard turns to her - looks down at the floor
          then starts toward the kitchen.
          Natalie races down the steps and stops.

          FRANKS'S BODY ON THE FLOOR. HIS FACE'IS HALF BLOWN AWAY.
          She's paralyzed, a scream trapped somewhere inside.
          She turns away.

          Richard sits at the kitchen table.
          The gun rests in front of him.
          His right sleeve splattered with Frank's blood.

          Matt?
          He lowers what we now see to be X.Ray and kills the light.

                         TT'S OFFICE
          He hesitates, presses the blinking hold button, picks up the
          receiver.

                         MATT
          Hello? ...Hello? Natalie?

          The blood drains from his face.

          WE HEAR THE DISTANT SOUNDS OF MACEDONIA.

          INT. R C D HIGH SCHOOL L- DUSK

          Matt stands in the hallway outside of the auditorium that is
          Ruth's classroom. A banner across the hall reads HAVE A

          WONDERFUL SUMMER, SEE YOU IN THE FALL.
          The choir finishes the last strains. Ruth is happy the
          rehearsal has gone well. She smiles in a way that expresses
          the simple joy she will never know again.

                         RUTH
          Great.
          The girls gather their things and start out, laughing and
          running after each other. Matt stands in the hallway as they
          rush past.

          EXT. ST. FRANCIS CEMETERY - DAY

          Frank's casket is lowered into the ground.
          A large gathering of relatives and friends stand before Father
          Oberti as he finishes the eulogy.
          Matt's arm is tightly interlocked with Ruth's, beneath her
          eyes - swelling from three days of suffering. Their hands
          c enched to ether make one fist, both parents keeping the
          other uprig t. The rain glides down their faces, mixing easily
          with tears.
          Matt steps up to Frank's open grave.
          The gathering watches as Matt peers down into the hole,
          silently speaking to it. He reaches down, grabs a fistful of
          dirt. Then tosses it into the open grave.
          Matt pauses, staring down, into the hole ---
          He steps back, as Father Oberti delivers the end of his eulogy.
          Matt looks blankly around, noticing the family's many friends
          includin ; Carl and Henry from the game, Willis and Katie, and
          Frank's friend, T°
          Matt's eyes linger on someone behind T°

                         

                         

                         

                         
          A LONE FEMALE FIGURE IN BLACK, away from the crowd. Natalie.
          Their eyes meet.
          Matt, almost imperceptibly, nods.

          INT - FOWLER HOUSE - DAY
          A large casserole is placed on a long table with many assorted
          dishes. A HAND REACHES IN, scoops up some of the casserole onto
          a small plate, and carries it to

          A SMALL CLUSTER OF PEOPLE
          standing in the middle of a much larger gathering, the reception
          after the funeral.
          Matt stands in the downstairs hallway. He looks around the
          room, as if it is all a dream.
          Children getting soda pop. Others in conversation. The odd
          person looks up at him, then turns away.
          Willis steps up to Matt.
          His wife, Katie, stands nearby.
          Matt doesn't seem to notice Willis.
          Willis puts a gentle hand on his friend's arm.

                         WILLIS

                         (SOFTLY)
          Can I get you anything?
          Matt suddenly looks up at them, as if confused.

                         MATT
           ere-s Rut h?

                          KATIE
           She went to lie down, Matt.
          He turns d heads upstairs. Willis and Katie watch him go.

                         UPSTAIRS
          Matt approaches their bedroom. The door is a

                         BEDROOM
          He steps in, to Ruth, who is on the bed. Her back is to him,
          a arently sleeping. Crumbled tissues litter the bed, the
          f oor,
          Matt ietl moves to her. He reaches down, about to touch her
          head. Something stops h°

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1-5
          He turns, and leaves.

                         UPSTAIRS
          Frank's room is facing him. Instinctively, he goes to open the
          door, then pauses.

                         'S ROOM
          Matt slowly enters. He looks around, as if freezing the room in
          his memory.
          The place is untouched. Frank's many sketches are still pinned to the
          wall. Some clothes lie scattered on the floor. His fishing cap.
          Matt starts to pick up. He takes Frank's clothes from the floor
          and places them on his bed.
          He looks at a dirty T-shirt in his hand. He brings it to his face. He
          inhales deeply, able to smell his son's lingering scent-
          Finally, he sets the shirt on the bed. Wanders around. Strays
          near Frank's drafting table-
          He reaches out, touching the table, grazing°the topogra h of
          scattered pencils - drawings strewn across it- The Froe e Gifts.
          He takes a seat at the table. Feeling its frame, the sketches,
          the seat below-
          And without warning he is overcome. He lurches forward,
          burying his face in his hands. The sobs come unrestrained,
          violently, like a sudden tidal wave.

          A LAUGH-TRACK fills the air.
          Ruth in pajamas and bathrobe, watches a stand-up comic on TV.
          She sips tea from a mug.
          Matt appears at the door, kettle in hand.

                         MATT
          Some more?
          Ruth looks up and nods.

          Matt stands atop a ladder underneath a large Maple, he
          struggles with a pair of pruning shears. At war with a large
          br c - the branch seems to be winning.

          Ruth, still dressed in her robe, pads down the hallway.
          Stops to glance out the window at
          NATT - working.

          EXT. FOWLER HOUSE

          Ruth stands transfixed. REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW PANE BELOW

          HER FACE: SEE
          QuJ glimpses through branches, of a small boy scampering up a
          tree. Flashes of arms, legs, a smile.
          We can make out the GIGGLES of the child, but they are
          distorted, wobbly, as if deteriorated by memory.
          The tree shudders as the boy climbs higher.

          MATT O.S. RUTH O.S.
          Okay - watch it now, Frank. Frank, listen to your father.
          That's high enough ...
          The tree continues shaking.
          Ruth allows the memory, then turns back and pads back down the
          hallway.

          INT. UNION CLINIC MATT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Matt sits behind his desk catching up on some paperwork.
          Janelle appears in the doorway.

          I'm going to lunch Dr. Fowler--
          .alright
          She continues smiling as though ting to extend her tenderness. Matt
          avoids eye-contact. cie Leaves. Matt looks relieved.

          . GRINNEL'S CR W-S NEST - DAY
          Willis opened this place after serving as a chief petty officer
          in the Vietnam War. The theme, if there is one, is definitely
          nautical. Snapshots of longtime customers are stapled on the
          walls between the booths and tables, two are framed, and
          prominent. They are from Willis' - -, days; The first an
          entry photo of A YOUNG WILLIS front of the ha f. The
          second a sun faded color photo of : att and Willis. Both ook
          to be in their twenties, both dressed in Navy Whites.
          The trade here is mostly ve early breakfast, and then lunch
          for the men who work at the leather and shoe factories.

          A MUTED news show plays on a ceiling at the far end of the
          booths. A sign on the wall reads T your "Forget about lunch"
          breakfast.
          Willis carries over two plates with omelettes, parks them on
          the table, and takes a seat across from Matt.

                         WILLIS
          Don't worry, I didn't make em.
          Matt takes a bite. He winces.

                         WILLIS
          What? Oh, that's mine.
          He switches plates.

                         WILLIS
          Sorry.
          Matt takes another bite. Better,

                         WILLIS
          You got back to work so quick, Matt. It's
          not too soon?

                         MATT
          I can't stay home. So, how's business?

                         WILLIS
          Oh,.you know, same old crap. Got held up
          again, you knew that.

                         MATT
          No. I didn't.

                         WILLIS
          yeah...they got seventy five bucks.

                         MATT
          Were you on the till?
          Willis chuckles, shakes his head.

                         WILLIS
          They would have gotten something else if
          I'd been on the till.
          Matt nods.

                         WILLIS
          How you doin', Matt?
          You on't write, you don't call. Where'd
          the love go? '0-'

                         MATT
          Nag nag nag.
          Matt glances at an old clipping from the BOSTON GLOBE stapled
          to the wall. It's a photo from the 67 Redsox dream to

          Petrocelli, Yaztrems i and Reggie Smith, each hold u two
          fingers, they are s °ling after hitting consecutive omeruns.
          Matt remembers. Happier days.

                         WILLIS
          They set the bail hearing yet?

                         MATT

                         WI IS
          Are you going?

                         MATT
          I don't ow. Davis says it's a formallity
          really. I haven't talked to Ruth about
          weather she thinks we should go or not.

                         WILLIS
          If it's too much for Ruth, I'll come with
          you Matt.

                         MATT
          Thanks, but I'm sure it'll be alright-
          Davis says it's a formallity really.

                         WILLIS
          The criminal trial set yet?

                         MATT
          October.

                         WILLIS
          October?

                         MATT
          That's what they tell me, anyway.

                         WILLIS
          Christ, they take their time.

                         MATT
          .yeah, well, he's in there now.

                         WILLIS
          They're keeping him busy, I'm sure - You
          know where they'll move h once he's
          sentenced?
          Matt shifts the focus to his omelette.

                         MATT
          You have any Tabasco sauce?
          Willis pauses. He looks around, ca `out to the kitc hen.

                         WILLIS
          Hey, Pete. Tabasco. Pete! Ah, shit.
          He heads to the back. Matt looks out the window. A refrigera ted
          truck with the STROUT logo on it's side pulls to a stop at the
          light. Willis returns with sauce in hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         49
          He takes a seat. Shifts his tone again.

                         WILLIS
          Next weekend Matt- We really want you to
          come up to the c p- Katie's insisting.
          Not to pressure you or anything. But if
          you don't come se's going to invite her
          sister and that idiot and I know I'm
          going to wind up insulting him again.
          Matt considers this.

                         WILLIS
          The future of my family is in your hands.

                         MATT
          Let me ask Ruth.

                         WILLIS
           You know, your seat is getting cold at the
           game. We have Carl's kid subbing for you.
           Not that we mind - he loses every time
           But we'd rather take your money.

          MA T T T

                         (SMILING)
          Thanks.
          Matt stares aimlessly out the window.
          Willis goes back to his eggs.
          Both men comfortable enough with each other to be silent.

                         WILLIS
          How's Ruth doing?

                         MATT
          Alright. Her...her car broke down.

                         WILLIS

          Matt carries the bags into the kitchen.

          MATT .S.
          Fine. Saw Willis-

                         RUTH
          My day was fine, too, thanks.
          Matt comes out of the kitchen.

                         MATT
          Sorry. ,how was your day?
          Tried calling - thought you might have
          gone out. The Grinnel's invited us up to
          the camp next weekend. Said I'd check with
          you, if we had other plans

                         RUTH
          That sounds fine.
          He turns, a little surprised.

                         MATT
          We don't have to.
          She looks up at him.

                         RUTH
          You don't want to go?

          Mr. Strout has been in the custody°of The
          Knox County Sherrif's department since
          August second, held without bail.The
          court is obliged to hold a bail hearing
          within two weeks of incarceration , which
          is the purpose of our procedings here
          today. Given the schedule considerations
          on this docket, the court feels that we
          should conduct the probable cause hearing
          in tandem. Witnesses will be called at
          this time. Unless there are any
          objections to the contrary this court
          will recess until 2:00 p.m.

          Natalie comes up the brick walk and enters the building.

          INT. OX COUNTY COURTHOUSE LATER

          A gray concrete room, washed out by the buzzing overhead
          florescent.
          Matt and Ruth sit on metal fold-out chairs, alongside twenty or
          so spectators, and a smattering of reporters, in the gallery.
          Richard unkempt and dressed in an ORANGE JUMPSUIT, sits
          patientiy next to one of his two attorneys.
          Matt and Ruth glance over at
          NATHAN STROUT, 62, sitting directly behind Richard.
           Nathan's two other sons, both big men like Richard, sit at his
          side.
          Nathan feels the Fowlers, stares. His eyes stay focused on the
          front of the room.
          Richard's trial attorney, MARLA S, 301s, smart, expensive, and a
          long way from her home in Boston, stands in the COURT WELL.
          Natalie Strout in the witness box.
          So, Mr. Fowler had asked you to go
          upstairs with your chil, ?z s your
          husband was trying to enter...
          DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILLIAM DAVIS, 40, rises.

                         DAVIS
          objection. Mrs. Strout's police interview
          is already documented, the defense has a
          copy of it. There's no reason to waste
          anymore of the court's time . - .

                         KEYES
          Your Honor, we just want to review exactly
          what s. Strout saw on the afternoon of
          July 17th. Isn't that why we're here?
          The Judge nods.

                         JUDGE
          overruled.

                         (TO NATALIE)
          Please continue.
          Natalie tries to recapture her place. Keyes nods.

                         MARLA KEYES

                         (RECAPPING)
          So you were bringing your children up to
          their bedroom ...
          Natalie's glance wanders to the gallery, to Matt and Ruth.
          She,sits on her hands to keep them from shaking.

                         NATALIE
          0 Right. I was in Jason and Dunk's room I
          didn't know what was happening downstairs. I was
          getting worried. I asked Jason to read Dunk a
          story. He didn't want a story - He wanted to come
          with me ... so I sat him back down on the bunk
          and I left them in the room.

                         KEYES
          You left "them"?

                         NATALIE
          My boys.
          She starts to cry.

                         KEYES

                         (SOFTLY)
          Of course - I'm sorry. on.

                         NATALIE
          I closed the door...I moved down the hall. I
          looked back to make sure they weren't behind me.
          I had just started down the stairs, when I heard
          the shot. I ran down...
          A deep sob ...

                         NATALIE
          .and Richard...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         53

                         KEYES
          I'm sorry, can we just back up? You said
          you "heard the shot"?

                         NATALIE
          Yes.

                         KEYES
          You "heard"? s- Strout, did you witness
          the accident?
          Prosecutor Davis jumps up.

                         DAVIS
          b`ection. There are no grounds to
          in icate this was an "accident"
          The Judge nods.

                         JUDGE

                         (TO STENOGRAPHER)
          Please strike "accident" from the record.
          (to Marla Keyes)
          Ms. Keyes, please rephrase the question.
          Marla Keyes hasn't taken her eyes off Natalie. They both know
          what's next.

                         KEYES

                         (GENTLY)
          Mrs. Strout ...did you actually see the
          sidearm discharge?

          I NT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
          Davis hands a cup of coffee to Matt, who sits on a faux leather
          couch with Ruth.

                         DAVIS
          (to Ruth re: coffee)
          You sure you don't want?

                         RUTH
          I'm fine.
          Davis takes a seat across from them.

                         DAVIS
          You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just
          not set up that way.
          RUTH - -y
          You let that bastard walk out and we're
          supposed to just sit here? Don't tell us
          there's nothing to do about this.

                         DAVIS
          It's not us, s. Fowler. The state's bail
          code is to ensure future court appearances

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         54

                         DAVIS
          In this case Strout's family was prepared to
          put up a substantial amount of property as
          bail - That, along with his ties to the
          community made it hard for us to convince the
          judge of a serious "Risk of Flight".

                         RUTH
          Oh - I see.

                         DAVIS
          It's not just your case. Now you can file a civil
          suit. I recommend it. But not now, wait till
          after the crimminal trial.
          Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk. It is
          one of those things that were popular in the 70's. A little man
          chasing an ambulance. It reads "World's Greatest Lawyer."

                         RUTH
          And when will that be? Next week, next
          month?

                         DAVIS
          Well... honestly - anywhere between twelve
          and eighteen months?

                         RUTH
          I thought you said there would be a jury
          trial sometime in October!?

                         DAVIS
          If he was incarcerated the udge would
          move for an October date - basically to
          save the County the cost of housing and
          feeding him as an inmate - But with bail
          the court date, unfortunately, is always
          later.

                         RUTH
          Oh my god, oh my god.
          Matt jumps in.

                         MATT
          But you're confident you'll be able to put
          him away for good then... Right?
          Davis looks uncomfortable with the question.
          Ruth sees this. She gathers herself.

                         ??

                         RUTH EJ
          The things she said in there ...what is the
          damage?

                         DAVIS
          Manslaughter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         55

                         RUTH DAVIS
          What? Oh, Jesus Christ! The wav this is going, that'd
          be my bet - especially since
          Nathan Strout brought up that
          barracuda from Boston - she's
          very smart.

                         RUTH
          This was no accident. Be killed our son in
          cold blood.
          Ruth.

                         RUTH
          What?

                         MATT
          How long would he be sent away for?

                         DAVIS
          Hard to say really. Anywhere between five
          to fifteen years. We think we have a good
          shot at the max - fifteen. Even with good
          behavior, he'd do a full ten.

                         RUTH
          Ten years? Five years? Are you out of your
          mind!? He killed my son. Does anyone know
          this?
          Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis.
          Davis sits back, a little shook up.

                         DAVIS
          I'm sorry, s. Fowler. I understand.
          Unfortunately, in situations like this
          when there is no eye witness, there ...
          well, there's not a lot we can do.

          INT. MATT'S CAR - DAY - MOVING

          Matt drives. Ruth looks out the windshield.
          Both in their own worlds.
          Ruth turns to look out her side window.

          T CANNERY'S STACKS ARE HUMPING.

                         RUTH
          You took the whole day?
          Matt nods.

          CAR DRIVES PAST T SITE.

          A handful of reporters and photographers lingering on the
          lawn, are galvanized by the arrival of the Fowlers.

          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE DAY
          Ruth is just entering, jostled, relieved to be home.
          She turns. Matt's not there. She looks out the front door to

          MATT AT THE BASE OF THE
          surrounded by reporters.

          Dr. Fowler, how do you feel about
          Richard's Strout's bail?

                         REPORTER #2
          Do you plan to take any further legal
          action, Dr. Fowler?

                         REPORTER #3
          Dr. Fowler, have you had any contact with
          Mr- Strout?
          Matt stands paralyzed, a deer caught in the headlights.

                         THE KITHCHEN
          Matt enters as Ruth takes the plates to the sink. She keeps her
          back to him. He pulls off his coat.

                         MATT
          Can you believe this? I ask those idiots to
          leave. No one budges. Not one. What the hell
          are we supposed to do, bring them sandwiches?

          leave.

          Ruth is aslee Matt stares at the ceiling. He turns to the s
          clock. It- a ter three.

          He opens a cupboard door and grabs some Fig Newtons. He
          stands there eating them, the door of the cupboard is long,
          the kind you see in old capes. Matt stares at the inside of
          the door. His finger slides down the length, he kneels down.
          We see what he's looking at. Pen and pencil marks straight
          lines each about two inches apart - each with Frank's name
          and aqe.

                         T DEN
          Matt sits in his chair. The plays, muted. He °s looks at it,
          but he's not watching.
          Finally, he rises, clicks the off, with the remote, and
          flicks off the light.

          Matt wearing a light coat over his pajamas, sits behind the

          out his windshield, looking at the corner duplex unit.

          INT. FOWLER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Ruth sits at the table in her bathrobe. Smoking. The CAMDEN
          HERALD in one hand. The COURIER GAZETTE, and THE WORKING
          WATERFRONT within easy reach.
          Matt enters, fully dressed in jeans and a sweater. He winces at
          the smoke.

                         RUTH
          You slept late. For you.

                         RUTH
          You never do that.
          She turns the page, absorbed in an article.
          Shaking her head, she slaps the paper down.

                         RUTH
          Well there it is in black and white. You
          should read some of the things he says.
          Unbelievable.
          Matt takes a sip of coffee. He glances down at the paper.
          He nods, without really looking.

                         MATT
          yeah.
          He checks his watch.

                         MATT
          I should get going.

                         RUTH
          Where? It's Saturday.

                         MATT
          I won't be gone long.
          He bends, kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                         MATT
          I'm meeting Willis. I'll tell him we're
          coming.
          She stares at the kitchen doorway long after he exits.
          Finally, she pulls the paper back and resumes reading.

          . CANDY'S QUICK SHOP - DAY
          Natalie stands behind the only counter cf a small MOM AND POP
          STORE whose specialty is cold beer, wine, cigarettes, and fish
          & Game Licenses. She rings up some items for a couple of
          teenagers.
          Matt enters the place, keeping his distance, a few feet from
          the counter.
          Natalie sees him.
          She pauses, as if quickly trying to-,gather her thoughts, the
          teenagers are waiting for their chang .
          She counts it back to them, and they exit.
          Matt steps forward.

          Natalie quickly rings up the items and bags them.

                         ELDERLY WOMAN
          Can you break a fifty?
          Natalie takes the bill, places it in a drawer underneath the
          register, and hands the woman her change, with a smile.

                         ELDERLY WOMAN
          Thank you, dear.

                         NATALIE
          You're welcome.

                         ELDERLY WOMAN
          Could I possibly get another bag?
          Natalie quickly double bags the woman's groceries.
          There is a break in the customer flow. Natalie steps to the end
          of the counter.

                         MATT
          I just wanted to see how you're doing. I
          tried reaching you ...

                         NATALIE
          Oh. We're at my mother's house now. I'm
          sorry, I wanted to call you ...

                         MATT
          It's okay.
          She looks over. A man hovers over some ina?azines near the
          re inter.

                         NATALIE

          Dr. Fowler ..-I' so...I don't even know
          how to begin...

                         MATT
          You don't have to.
          NATALIE ? er
          I didn't lie the first time, I didn't,
          it's just - how it came out. I'm so sorry.
          matt nods, as if he had assumed as much.

          Is s- Fowler .-- does she know you're
          here?
          The Man places a 12- ack of beer on the counter. Natalie looks
          to Matt, who shakes his head no.
          Natalie steps back to the register and rings up the beer.
          Her chin quivers. She makes a mistake on the register, has to
          start over.
          A few more customers gather on line.

                         NATALIE

                         (TO CUSTOMER)
          Can I get you anything else?
          She rings him up. Makes change as another customer steps up.
          Matt steps near her, trying to maintain privacy.

                         MATT

                         (QUIETLY)
          How are the boys? Are they okay?
          Natalie, choked by emotion, cannot respond. Near tears, she
          puts her hand up, unable to speak.
          Matt reaches out to touch her arm.
          His gesture is interrupted as:
          She pulls the cigarettes from an overhead rack. The Man pays.
          Matt stays a moment longer. There's nothing else to say.
          He leaves.
          She returns to her job.

          We see Ruth from a good distance away, watched from afar. She
          places some potted daisies on a grave. She kneels down.

          She is startled.
          She turns around. It's Father Oberti.

          EXT. ST. FRANCIS CEMETERY LATER

          Ruth and Father Oberti sit smoking on a bench.

                         RUTH
          It comes in waves, .and then nothing. Like
          a rest in music. No sound - but so loud.
          A moment.

                         RUTH
          I don't know what to do.
          Father Oberti nods.

                         RUTH

          Father Oberti looks off in the distance.

                         FATHER OBERTI
          Louise McVey lost a child a few years
          back. Maybe you remember.

                         RUTH

                         (SEARCHING)
          mmmm she had four - it was the youngest
          girl, wasn't it?

                         FATHER OBERTI
          Yes. She told me about a vision she had
          when she found out her daughter had
          died ...she saw herself at a great
          distance from the earth encircling
          it, an endless line - as she got closer
          she saw that it was made up of mothers
          traveling forward. She fell into line,
          and began walking with them. When they
          reached a certain point, the line
          divided. She said she knew - that all the
          millions of women on her side - were the
          mothers who had lost children-she
          seemed to find great comfort in that.
          Ruth doesn't react.

                         RUTH
          How did she die?

                         FATHER OBERTI
          A drowning ... some kind of swimming
          accident.

          mower moves across the lawn, spitting up a shower of grass.
          Matt pushes the mower.

          A small bouti e frequented by mature women. Blouses with a flair,
          pantsuits, an nice dresses han from the racks. The sort of place a
          woman can still buy a pair Joze a white gloves. The front of the store
          is devoted to footwear.
          Ruth sits while YVONNE, 45, kneels in front of her, holding
          Ruth's stockinged foot. She slips on a dress shoe.

                         YVONNE
          Oh, they're beautiful on you Ruth.
          Ruth stands up, takes a few steps.
          She stares at the shoes.
          They are a rich black.

                         RUTH
          Do you have them in brown?

                         YVONNE
          I think so, let me check.
          Yvonne disappears into the back.
          Ruth walks to the front of the store, browsing.
          She moves to the display window and brings a pair of very
          young pumps u to her nose, and inhales. She smiles and sets
          the shoes bac on the ledge.
          Something OUTSIDE catches her attention.

          EXT. YVONNE'S SPECIALTY SHOPPE - SAME TIME

          The REFLECTION OF A COUPLE, walking down the sidewalk, can be
          glimpsed in the window, their movement WASHES ACROSS RUTH'S

          FACE.

          ON THE COUPLE.
          a YOUNG BLOND WO holding hands with a dark haired, young
          he turns to smile at her. We see his face.

          YVONNE O.S.
          I'm sorry Ruth - there's only the black.

          She turns from the window. Yvonne stands next to her, an open
          shoe box in her hands.

          EXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER

          Two Hefty bags are dragged along the walk. Matt tosses one
          next to a garbage that sits just inside the garage. He picks
          up the other bag tossing it inside.
          The bottom splits and grass spills out onto the drive-way. He
          goes inside and returns with a broom.
          He sweeps the rass into a pile. Picking up handfuls and
          refilling the gay. He takes the broom and sweeps what's left
          back toward the la . He stops, stares down at his feet.

          Ruth's car pulls into the driveway.
          She gets out, almost slamming the car door.
          Without a word, she moves past Matt, and into the house.
          Matt continues sweeping.

          Ruth wakes to the sound of metal on metal. She looks over to
          Matt, he's not there.

                         (SCARED)
          Matt?
          She steps to the window, pulls back the shears and looks out.
          Through the window, in the dark, alone, flashlight in hand.
          Matt is dismantling the swin set.

          - GRINNEL CABIN - DAY
          A four room dwelling, surrounded by a wrap around porch that
          looks out over a canopy of forest below. The place was built
          before insulation was practical. Planks, beams , and studs are
          exposed. There is a bathroom, two bedrooms, and a common room
          consisting of a kitchen/dining area, and living room, with a
          ge, river stone fireplace.
          There are two oil burning 1 ps hanging from cross beams at
          each end of the room. Ruth sits next to Katie at a table in
          the middle of the room. Katie is ouring over a stack of
          snapshot books, descibin her chid "h and r dchildren in
          eac pose. The photos, w ile many, are all from a single trip
          that the family made to Florida. There is a clear dif erence

          that has been trained to reach anyone who might be in the f

          it's a kind of a laminated card and you
          put it intah a machine and it tells you
          what time to come back - so you can go
          right in without waitin in lane. You guys
          ever go down to Florida?

          have now?
          Katie turns from the snapshots and takes a breath while
          holding up her fingers to count-She is genuinely unsure.

                         KATIE

          Well there's lil Charles, Shannon, the

          Well sometimes I wished I was an only
          child - let me tell you. When I was
          little, my big sister could get me to do
          anything. More than once she got me to
          throw m self down the stairs by telling
          inc the blanket she wrapped me in was a
          magic car et- Naturally, not being that
          swift, I believed her. Plus which, on
          this trip to Florida, we was in one of
          the Kingdoms there, and she was going on
          about how's we had to go on this one ride
          that was in this sort of mountain.
          I said -"K as long as it's not a roller
          coaster- on account of my back-" Well,
          we get strapped intah the little car
          there she starts laughing - Oh it's a
          rollercoaster alright - that one there.
          She points to the pictures.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
          A ride in the dark, no less.

          Willis plants his in the stump.

          You ask me that eve t° e. You know the cove, the
          other side of the c in?
          yeah ...?

                         WILLIS
          All the way to the other shoreline.
          Matt turns to him, grinning.

                         WILLIS
          Almost three hundred and fifty acres.
          Know what it went for when I bought it?
          You don't want to know.
          Matt continues surveying, awed.
          Willis turns, starts walking back to his chore.

                         WILLIS
          Come on, I'll let you help me.
          Matt joins him. Together, they bundle up the wood.

                         TO
          Matt and Willis load the wood into a small trailer attached
          a GREEN POLARIS MAGNUM 500 ATV.

                         WILLIS
          Only got 1/2 a chord of Oak left at home
          and you know how much that bastard Daniels
          charges - least I can stack this up to the
          cabin ... have something to burn this fall.

          Matt sits behind Willis on the ATV as they pull the wood up
          road. The trees clear and we see the cabin. A GREEN SUBARU
          FORESTER is parked in front.

          I NT. GRINNEL CABIN - DAY
          Willis, Katie, Matt and Ruth, sit around a copious holiday
          spread, well into their meal.

                         KATIE
          It's a wonderful product and the treat you
          pretty good. It was on account oz, selling Mary
          Kay, that we got the new Subaru.

                         RUTH

                         (SMALL TALK)
          The ride up was very comfortable. It's a
          very nice car.

          Well it's not really a car, it's got four-wheel drive.
          It's a little SUV.
          The Grinnel's custom, is to loudly, and with very little effort,
          finish each others sentences. This is how they have fun.

                         KATIE

          Yeah, guess it's too much trouble to just
          say what something is anymore.

                         WILLIS
          (to the table)
          What does PMS stand for?

                         KATIE
          Yeah well,I was an army brat.
          I grew up with jeeps. Willy is just
          uncomfortable that I know more about one
          masculine thing than he does.
          Just one?
          The pty chuckles.

          She shoots him a look.
          He catches it - , V o-,
          A moment.

          They're pillowcases from our first house.
          Ruth smiles at the memory. Katie sits back down at the table.

          EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

          A post stands proudly at the end of a dirt and gravel road.
          Attached to it are two signs. One reads PRIVATE ROAD. The
          other, NO HUNTING.
          It butts up against two lanes of blacktop - a small logging
          road.
          Headlights cut through the early evening.
          Willis's idea of a S a green, SUBARU FORESTER, kicks up some
          rocks. it pauses briefly before taking a right onto the pavement.

          The car is stopped behind a wooden guard arm. A swing bridge
          opens for a large fishing boat. The bridge is operated by one
          man. Be uses a long metal tool, that he loops into a pulley
          system, which lies beneath a grid in the center of the
          bridge.

          Ruth asleep in the back seat, it-s been a long weekend. Matt
          glances over at her, then up to the front
          We are outside the car as it waits for the Drawbridge to
          close, so it may continue. We hear the following from
          perspective.

          Well he dunnit want to go overseas - oh
          no...he told them he'd Reep doinit as
          long as he could stay in Maine or Vermont-

          But David says if theyy want him to go out
          to New Mexico or California, he'll go
          back to infantry - he don't care. Long as
          he stays out here. He's not about to--

                         WI IS
          Course he don't like working in
          recruitment anyhow's - Christ he gets
          them bo s come down to to the office at
          the mal - he gets them half-way
          processed and they decide they want that
          delayed entry thing - Christ I could't do

                         TIE
          Or they decide not to join up at all and--

                         WI IS
          Well, like that one kid - he had him all
          the way through the works and then - Oh

                         CHRIST-

                         KATIE
          His folks called David and said that the
          boy wanted out so bad -- that he'd taken
          his own life.
          They all look at each other. How did this conversation get so
          depressing?

                         WILLIS
          Yeah well something like that gets to you
          Christ, I couldn't do it.

          Ruth is at the table, alone, dressed for rehearsal, hair done.
          She finishes her breakfast as she pours through the weekend's
          mail.
          Matt in a suit, steps in to say goodbye.

                         MATT
          I'm going now.
          She looks up.

                         RUTH

                         ANGLE
          Who looks to Ruth for some kind of reaction. Nothing.
          Matt heads out the door.
          Ruth continues sorting the mail.
          She stops on one piece. Seems stunned, repeatedly reading it.

                         THE ENVELOPE
          It's from Publisher's Clearinghouse.
          In oversized block letters, it reads,

          FRANK FOWLER, YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY WON $10,000,000!
          She stares at the piece for a long time.
          Looks off. Smiles. And starts giggling. She can't stop.
          The giggles quickly flow into a deep laughing fit, harder and
          harder as the tears rain down.

          INT. MATT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Matt is in his office, on the phone.

          Janelle knocks on the door.

                         MATT
          Hold on a second.
          He puts his mouth over the speaker and lowers the phone.
          Nods to Janelle and she enters.

          I'm sorry bL _; you'll have to re-schedule.
          Janelle's a little taken aback.

          I'll call back later.
          He hangs up.
          He gets up and grabs his jacket

                         MATT
          Sorry Janelle, I'll be back at four.

          Hey, Matt.
          Matt stands awkwardly, as Davis' companions look on.

                         DAVIS

                         (POLITE)
          Have a seat.
          Matt hesitates, takes a seat next to Davis.
          Manages an obligatory smile to the others. The conversation
          resumes.

          EXT - MARKET ON MAIN RESTAURANT - STREET LATER
          On the street outside the restaurant, walking.

                         DAVIS
          We're doing all we can, Matto I promise
          you that.

                         MATT
          What can I do Bill?

                         DAVIS
          There's nothing...
          Matt takes Davis' arm.

                         MATT
          It can't be manslaughter. There's got to
          be something - isn't there something you
          can find? A piece of evidence? That
          happens - doesn't that happen?
          He realizes he's holding Davis' arm. He lets goo
          Davis looks at Matt sympathetically.

                         DAVIS
          We really are doing everything we can,
          Matt - But I'm not going to lie to you -
          We've got no witnesses - only Strout - who
          claims there was a struggle - and forensic
          can't determine if there was a struggle.
          because of the condition the house was in
          when Frank got there.
          Matt says nothing. ¢Q.,
          They come to the corner.
          Matt steps under an awning and into the shade.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         73
          Davis stops. He shifts feet a couple of t°es. Pla ing with
          the change in his pocket, the way people do when they're
          uncomfortable.

                         DAVIS
          I'm sorry att. if it helps, we all want
          this guy put away. We have kids, too.
          Matt nods, without looking at him.
          Matt looks at Davis's hand moving the change. He becomes
          hypnotized by the sound.
          Davis continues talking. Matt can't hear a word of it,
          though. All he hears is the clinking of the coins in the
          pocket.

          EXT. GIGI HARBOR - DAY

          Matt stands in the wheelhouse, he brings the helm about,.cuts
          back on the throttle and heads for the winch, the stern is
          stacked with four high rows of Frank's empty traps.
          Matt pulls up a string of pots. Opens the door and pulls out
          a young male. He flinches and drops it. His finger goes to
          his mouth.

          EXT. GIGI HARBOR LATER

          Loaded up to the gills with pots. She turns toward harbor.

          EXT. GIGI HARBOR - S

          Matt at the wheelhouse heading in. His hand on the wheel,
          blood trickles from his finger. He sucks on it again, reaches
          down underneath his feet and pulls a band-aid from a box and
          applies it to the finger.

          EXT. "GIGI" LATER

          Matt unloads Frank's traps onto the landing.
          He stops. Seems to sense something. He looks back up the gangway.
          Jason sits on his bicycle watching.
          The two regard each other for a moment. Then without a word
          Jason rides off.

          Willis dries a glass. He keeps an eye on
          Matt sitting at a booth in the front?f the diner, silhouetted

          bottle of beer. It's not the first.

          Ruth is alone at her desk, she wears headphones and is busy
          making notations on a sheet of manuscript paper.
          There's a KNOCK on her door. She doesn't look up.

                         RUTH
          (taking off the phones)
          Yes?
          There's a pause, then the door slowly opens.
          Natalie takes a step in.
          Ruth looks up. If she's surprised, she doesn't show it,

                         NATALIE
          I - -a I hope this is okay.
          Ruth says nothing. Natalie moves closer.

                         NATALIE
          I've been hoping we might be able to get
          together - to talk.
          Ruth watches her as she approaches the desk. Natalie bends and
          cautiously extends her hand for Ruth to hold.

                         NATALIE
          I just want to tell you how -e-
          And in a flash Ruth SLAPS Natalie across the face with her open
          hand.
          Natalie springs back, paralyzed with shock.
          She tries to catch her breath, staring directly at Ruth.
          Eyes ablaze, Ruth says nothing.
          - The two women look at each other for a very long time
          And final , as if she finally somehow got the resolution she
          came for, lead held high, Natalie turns and walks out.

          Tim, Frank's friend, exits with his co-workers.

          INT. SHOW & TELL - AFTERNOON - LATER

          A crowded working class tavern. Video oker machines, beef jerky at
          the bar, Schaeffer's on tap. We're in fuck. it's happy-hour.
          Tim sits around a table with a couple of buddies, laughing.

                         CHARLES
          We lost a few strings and we had a fair
          idea it was him who was doing it - so's I
          just flat out asked him "No wasn't me."
          You should of seen what he tried to pull
          last wintah. He was up to the island there
          - and he claimed our traps were in his
          part of the cove - Bobb was up to the
          tavern on the head and e d him shooting
          his mouth off about how he and his
          stet an was gonna take a bat to the old
          man & me - so's I told the old man about
          it and he says "Don't hurt my feelings
          none."He says "Go on down to the Walmart
          and buy a couple of plastic bats."
          Next day the old man walks intah the
          office at the market - near the scales -
          where he know's the son of a bitch is
          gonna come in with his catch. He's got two
          six penny nails a hammer, and the bats
          o'coarse, so he nails those things right
          intah the wall. The guy at the scales
          looks at him like he's nuts "Whatta ya
          doing there Ivan" he says "Just sending a
          message" and the old man walks out. I come
          in and I could see what he wrote across
          them things.
          The door to the bar opens.

                         TIM
          What?

                         CHARLES
          "Here's the bats - if you got the balls."
          Tim and the others crack up.

                         CHARLES
          Didn't touch our traps aftah that.

          Matt is passing by his table.

                         TIM
          Dr. Fowler?
          Matt flinches, "surprised" to see Tim.

          A FEW MINUTES LATER
          Matt and Tim have moved to another booth.
          Matt leans heavily on his elbows, listening to Tim.

                         TIM
          No - no, I don't even see Richard anymore.
          And he'd never tell me anything, believe
          Me.
          Matt takes a pull of beer.

                         MATT
          Sure, of course. I was just wondering, you
          know, maybe there was something you
          heard, through the grapevine, maybe one
          of his buddies said something ---

                         TIM

                         (SEARCHING MEMORY)
          No -a-

                         MATT
          I was thinking, Richard's brothers,
          they're still working with you, right?
          They must talk.
          Tim throws a nervous look over to the table where his friends
          ea They're oblivious to the conversation.
          He looks back to Matt, shifting in his seat.
          Matt leans forward. He speaks in an intense whisper.

                         MATT
          I'm just saying, Tim, if we could find
          something, something concrete. If you
          could just ... it could be just a slip of
          the tongue ---
          Tim looks into Matt's eyes, feeling the torment.

                         TIM
          I'll keep my ears open.
          Matt looks at him, dissatisfied.

                         TIM
          It's funny running into you here, Dr.
          Fowler.
          Matt looks at Tim blankly, then finishes his beer.

          Matt drives end of highway.

                         NEXT LIGHT
          Matt pulls into the left-hand turn lane and signals.
          There is a car in front of h° Above the licence plate is a
          yellow sticker which reads "Student Driver-" The plate itself
          is a vanity plate it says P Y4US-
          A 73 BLUE PICK- truck eases to a stop in the right lane, next
          to Matt's car.
          Matt glances over, for a moment he half expects to see Frank.
          He cracks the passenger side window, for a better look.
          He stares at the driver's window.
          Their window rolls down.
          attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at
          Matt.
          Lost in the absurdity, he doesn't look away.
          The light changes.
          The girl smiles sweetly and blows him a kiss, before
          continuing through the light.
          Matt watches her go - he smiles - as if somehow relieved.
          The car behind him gives a polite toot - Matt makes the
          left.

          - SOUTH END MARKET - S
          Ruth enters, passing the empty front register.
          She strolls down an aisle, pulling some items from the shelves.
          TWO N CHAT from the next aisle.

          NIC, 301S, wearing a clerk-s apron, price gun, and plastic tag tha:
           says IC, rounds the end of the aisle. As he does, he spots -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         78
          RUTH, moving down the aisle toward him. He freezes
          A nervous smile - He throws a quick look to the other
          aisle.

                         NICK
          (a little too loudly)
          Good evening, s - Fowler.

          AT THE COUNTER
          Ruth pulls out her purse as Nick rings her up.

                         RUTH
          Oh, and a pack of Marlboro Lights,

                         NICK
          Sure,
          As NICK reaches up to the overhead cigarette area, he can't
          help but glance past Ruth.
          Ruth catches this, she turns, and sees -

                         RIC
          appear from a far aisle - he makes a BEELINE FOR THE DOOR,

          SHE TURNS WHITE.
          he leaves, LOOKS BACK,

          THEIR ES HEET - AND THEN HE'S GONE.
          It's a long time before Ruth moves.
          Finally, she turns back to Nick.
          He looks at her, embarrassed, awaiting her reaction.
          She just stares at h°

          Ruth is putting groceries away, ignoring, or trying to, Matt
          who has appeared in the doorway.
          She puts milk in the refrigerator and stares into it for a long
          time, trying to decide what to do. He can feel her judging

          F'inall , .having resolved something in her mind, she closes
          the refrigerator door- revealing, taped to it, several
          newspaper articles on the case, gathered by her, no doubt,
          including one with a picture of Frank.

                         MATT
          How did it go today?
          She doesn't answer.

                         MATT
          Something wrong?
          She doesn't turn around.

                         RUTH
          Wrong? Like what, Matt? What could be
          wrong?
          She continues "straightening up", starts recklessly washing
          dishes.
          Matt doesn't leave.
          A plate SHATTERS in the sink.
          This stops her. She stares at it, then feels his presence. She
          turns around.

                         RUTH
          What do you want?
          He looks unsure of himself.

                         MATT
          I want to know what's going on.

                         RUTH
          Right.

                         MATT
          You're obviously upset. If there's
          something you want to talk about ...

                         RUTH
          Talk? Who, us? Oh, you mean to each other?
          What if somebod waked in? They wouldn't
          recognize us. They'd think they had the
          wrong house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         80
          Matt takes this in. He breathes deeply.

                         MATT
          Do you want to talk or not?

                         RUTH

                         ("SEARCHING" )
          Talk, talk ... oh, you must mean about our
          dead son. No, we haven't before, why
          should we bother now?
          They stare at each other across the kitchen.

                         (SLOW BURN)
          What can I do, Ruth?
          Ruth looks at him for a long time.

                         RUTH
          Forget it, Matt. Why don't you just go ...

                         MATT

                         (BUILDING)
          What do you want from me?

                         RUTH
          I want you to stop acting like nothing's
          happened! That's what I want.

                         MATT
          Why? because I'm not bouncing off the
          walls?

                         RUTH
          No, Matt, That would require feelings. We
          don't want you to hurt yourself.

                         MATT
          Do me a favor, Ruth. You want to have a
          grieving contest, go find someone else.
          He starts to turn.

                         RUTH
          yeah, I know how you grieve. have
          another beer.
          He spins back.

                         MATT
          WHAT DO YOU OW? WHAT? You know nothing!
          You know nothing about me. What I go
          through every day - ever lousy,
          stinking day.

                         RUTH
          No, I don't know, Matt. I don't know what
          you go through, or if you go through
          ything. But that's your choice, dear,
          not mine...

                         MATT
          You're goddamn right it is. My choice is
          to not scream at the world. Maybe one of
          us has to be reasonable here, did you ever
          think of that?

                         RUTH
          Reasonable? e, Matt, I don' t know about
          you, but I ss my son. I'm glad you have
          time for reason. That's what you imparted
          to Frank, That sense of reason - Oh, he
          thought you were very reasonable.

                         MATT
          What the hell is that supposed to mean?
          She is about to say something, but stops short.

                         RUTH
          Nothing.
          She turns back to the dishes.
          He moves in on her, seething.

                         MATT
          What are you really trying to say anyway?
          She says nothing, picking up the broken plates.

                         TT
          .that I'm the one responsible?
          She drops the pieces back in the sink and exits.

          something!
          She throws the door closed behind her, but he bangs it open
          with his palm.

                         MATT
          You of it backwards. I know what you
          think. That I was too lenient, that I let
          him get away with ...

          came to you?

                         RUTH

          listened!

                         RUTH
          No. But you did. You were winking at him
          the whole time. You encouraged him. You
          wanted what he had. Her.

                         MATT
          You've got to be kidding...

                         RUTH
          You know it. Come on. You wanted it, and you
          couldn't get it - that's why you didn't stop him
          so you could get your kicks through your son.
          You know that's what happened. And now you can't
          cope with it. You can't admit the truth - To me,
          or to yourself - You can't admit that he died for
          ygur fantasy piece of ass.
          Matt, stunned, reels for a second
          And then, finally, explodes.

                         TT
          You want to know why our son is dead,
          Ruth? He wasn't with her because of me, he
          went there because of you. Because you
          were so controllins, so overbearing, so
          angry that he was it, that he was our only
          one.

                         RUTH
          That is not true.

                         MATT
          It is! From the time he was little you
          were telling him why he was wrong.
          Everything he did was wrong. What was
          wrong with him, Ruth?
          She stares at him, dumbfounded.

                         1 011

                         MATT
          You are so unfor ivinge You are. That's
          what he said. Ana you're playing the same
          shit out with me - That's a horrible way to
          be! Horrible. You're bitter, Ruth. You
          can point your finger at me all you want

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         83

                         MATT
          .but you better take a good look at
          yourself first.
          She already has, of course.

                         RUTH

                         (WE )
          I just wanted to talk about what happened,
          Matt.

                         MATT
          You expect me just to open up to you?
          Embrace you? You scare me. How can I talk
          to you? I can't even look at you.
          They suddenly become aware of the DOORBELL, ringing, over and
          over.
          They watch each other, both reeling, both out of breath. The
          DOORBELL continues.

                         MATT

                         (COMPLETELY DRAINED)
          That's probably ... the police.

                         THE DOOR
          Matt opens it. There is no cop, just Kristen Gellar, 12, a young
          gymnast who'd like to compete in Hawaii.

                         KRISTEN

                         (REHEARSED)
          Hi there. I'm Kristen Gellar from the
          Rockland Gymnastics Association - Today
          we're selling brand name candy. Each
          purchase is matched by the Tandy
          corporation to help us meet our goal of
          travelling to Oahu to compete in the
          East/West conference.
          Matt's in another world. He stares at her.

                         MATT
          I... ...sure. I'll take some.

                          KRISTEN
           Terrific, how many? We have a special
          today, 6 bars for ten dollars.
          Ok...sure.
           if by rote, Matt pulls out his wallet and hands her a ten.

                          KRISTEN
          Great! " particular brands you like? We
          have , Goobers, Hershey's-
          Anything. Anything is fine ...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         81+
          She finally hands him an assortment.

                         MATT
          Okay ---
          He's about to close the door.

                         KRISTEN
          if you could just sign this. I have to
          give you a receipt. I'm sorry .this pen--
          Matt hands her one from his pocket.
          Matt waits as the girl fills out and hands him the receipt.
          He closes the door before she can thank h°

          THE LIVING ROOM
          Ruth is curled up on the couch.
          Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go.
          He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his
          hands - sets it on the coffee table
          He takes a seat at the other end of the couch.

                         MATT
          Ruth...

                         RUTH

                         (SOFTLY)
          Yes?

                         MATT
          Ruth .001 had no right. . .what I said -0. no
          one, no one should ever have to hear
          that...

                         RUTH

                         (BARELY AUDIBLE)
          I'm so sorry...
          He looks at her, as she starts to cry.
          He moves closer to her.

                         MATT
          It's okay...

                         RUTH
          No, you're right, Matt, You are
          am-.. horrible. ?-`

                         MATT
          Please--.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         85

                         RUTH
          I don't blame you, Matt. I just...
          that girl came by. She came by the
          school, and I couldn't forgive her. I was
          so...
          She lets go, crying hard.
          He lifts her head onto his lap.
          He reaches out, stroking her head, pulling her matted hair from
          her forehead as she sobs into his lap.

                         RUTH
          I'm sorry. I have been so an - I keep
          seeing him, Matt. I've seen him.
          Matt nods, but he's not really clear.

                         MATT

                         (CONFUSED)
          ..Oh I know - up in his room - Sometimes
          I swear Frank's in there - on the way home
          just now - at a stop light - for a second

                         I COULD'VE--

                         RUTH

                         (SOFTLY)
          Not Frank.
          Matt freezes.
          Then.

                         RUTH
          Richard...
          She breaks into sobs.

                         RUTH
          .and I don't know what to do.

                         MATT
          Where did you see him?

                         RUTH
          Eve here - Downtown, and the market. I
          saw at South End. He smiled at me,
          Matt - I keep running into him ... he
          s °led.
          Matt still strokes her hair.
          But he's in another world.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         86

          INTO GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
          The game has just started. Willis deals. Henry, Carl & Willis
          pick up the old banter as if Matt had onl been away on
          vacation; but he can see the affection an courtesy.in their
          eyes.

                         WILLIS
          The ne of the game is Texas Chase'
          He groans.

                         WILLIS
          Is there a problem?

                         HENRY
          Why do you delude yourself with that
          crap?

                         WILLIS
          What are you talking about?

                         HENRY
          Look we're not in Vegas. It's five card
          draw, or seven card stud.

                         WILLIS

                         (ENJOYING THIS)
          That's what I said five card draw - jacks
          to open - Carl?

                         HENRY
          Asshole,
          Matt smiles. He's missed these guys.

                          CARL
          I'll open with a dollar.

                         HENRY
          Raise a buck.
          The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long
          time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm.
          This stops him.
          Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising
          for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him.
          He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for
          someone to bust him.
          He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile
          uncomfortably. He can't take it.

                         TT
          Oh, for Christ sake say something!
          This wakes them up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         87

                         MATT
          Quit pussy footing around me d 't! You
          just gonna let me stare at these cards
          all night!?
          No one wants to make the first move.
          This upsets Matt even more.

                         MATT
          O.K. fine!
          He stares back down at his cards.
          Finally it is Carl who speaks.
          There are things of which I may not speak;
          There are dreams that cannot die;
          There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,
          And bring a pallor into the cheek,
          And a mist before the eye.
          And the words of that fatal song
          come over me like a chill:
          A boy's will is the wind's will,
          And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.
          Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes.
          The two men regard each other.

          EXT. GRINNEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

          The game has ended. Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as
          the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway. Matt is about to
          leave. Just climbing in the front seat. When Willis puts a hand
          on his shoulder.

                         WILLIS
          Come back in for a drink.

          I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE- ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
          Willis and Matt step back in, closing the door behind them.

          KATIE O.S.
          Honey, are you coming to bed now?
          Willis moves to the steps leading upstairs.

                         WILLIS
          Soon baby, Matt's still here.

           KATIE 0.S. 11 %-?.:
          Oh f hi Matt - Hone , would you mind
          bringing me my pit s? They're downstairs
          from when the kids were here.

                         WILLIS
          I'll be right there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
          A few minutes later.
          Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture
          hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly
          interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing
          time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A
          pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as
          the center piece.
          Willis comes down from upstairs.

                         WILLIS
          She's all set - now what can I get you?

                         MATT
          I'm fine thanks.
          Willis nods and takes a seat.

                         WILLIS
          - you back on the wagon?
          He is.

                         WILLIS
          Sit down Matt you're making me nervous.
          Matt takes a seat.

                         WILLIS
          I'm glad you came tonight.

                         MATT
          Me too.

                          WILLIS
          Boy, Carl really laid on the verse huh?

                         MATT

                         (CHUCKLING)
          ye ..ye he did. Got me thinking

                         OUT-
          e stops himself.

                          WILLIS
          What?

                         MATT
          I don't know - sort of silly really.

                         WILLIS
          C'mon what is it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         89

                         MATT
          This thing with - with Frank when he was
          about three, I guess. We were over at my
          folkls house.

                         MATT
          Mom always liked little dogs - this one
          was a - Pekingese, I think. I remember
          hearing this yelp, and then a scream.
          Frank ran out pointing to his finger. I
          looked at it couldn't see an thino. Mom
          said Frank must have "cornered the dog"
          and I knew she was probably right. We
          were driving home, and Ruth noticed Frank
          itching his a ..she pulled back his
          sleeve, and there were these two deep,
          bloody, puncture marks...

                         WILLIS
          Why do you think he pointed to his
          finger?
          Matt shakes his head.

                         TT

                         (SEARCHING)
          .I cruess he didn't want us to ow.
          He stares into his hands, as the memory crystallizes.
          Willis looks confused, and somewhat uncomfortable.

                         WILLIS
          He gets up and heads to the bar.

                         MATT

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          .had to put that dog down.
          Willis throws some ice in a tumbler.

                         WILLIS
          I was thinking just the other day about
          the last time Frankie was-
          Matt cuts him off.
          His name was Ar k. Not Frankie.
          Willis looks stunned.

                         WILLIS
          .I'm sorry Matt.
          I don't care ...he just never liked being
          called that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         90

                         WILLIS

          O.K.
          Matt nods. He looks away.

                         MATT
          She didn't tell me, Willis. She never
          said a word - She saw him at South End.

                         WILLIS
          Christ.

                         MATT
          She's seen him before. It's killing her
          I didn't think about bail. I thought I
          wouldn't have to worry about him for

                         YE S-

                         WILLIS
          You know what I heard? He's tending bar
          up to Old Orchard Beach.
          Matt looks up.

                         WILLIS
          For a friend. Ever notice even the worst
          bastards have friends? Nobody knows him
          over there. If they°do, they don't care.
          They drink what he mixes
          Willis sets a can of Moxie down in front of Matt.

                         WILLIS
          (referring to the can)
          I don't know how you drink this stuff
          it's what drove me to beer as a child.
          He sits down with his own drink.
          A moment.

                         WILLIS
          I hate him, Matt. My boys went to school
          with h° He was the same thei.,- Know
          what he' 11 do? Five at the most - And
          then you' 11 e bumping into h all over

                         AGAIN
          I ow.

                         WILLIS
          Remember that woman about seven years
          a o? Shot her husband sopped him of f
          t e bridge in the St - Gac-: with a
          hundred pound sack of cement and said the
          whole way through it nobody helped her.
          Know where she is now? She's in Sears ort
          now, a secretary. And whoever helped her,
          where the hell is he?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         91

                         WILLIS
          it'd break my heart Matt, it would, but -
          you ever think about just - moving away?
          Matt nods. Stares into his hands for a long time.

          MA,TT
          yeah, we have.
          Finally, he looks up, his eyes meeting Willis I s.

                         MATT
          It wouldn't matter.

          THE SOUND OF A LONE F VOICE - SINGING

          EXT. CAMDEN AMPHITHEATER - MAGIC HOUR

          The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet. We turn to
          find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll.
          A steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk
          as the sun dies. Looking around we see an ancient gazebo -
          then stairs leading up to a stone library - A boulder at the
          foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us -
          The girls, each holding a single candle,dressed in brightly
          embroidered smocks, enter in procession singing -Jennie Mae
          Mama. "
          The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening.
          The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an -
          AMPHITHEATER which faces the harbor. Ruth stands at the
          bottom of the proscenium - her arms up - directing the choir.
          The place is filled with half the town.

                         ANGLE MATT
          Trying to take it all in. But not really present.
          Suddenly he turns and leaves.

          EXT. OLD ORCHARD BEACH- NIGHT

          The town goes to sleep for the night. The signs businesses
          power down.

          EXT- PETER'S NIGHT
          The establishment's various Beer Signs & interior lights turn
          off.

          EXT. PETER'S - NIGHT

          A LARGE CHAIN OF KEYS Turns the tumbler of a deadbolt lock.
          Two cars are all that's left.
          A WAITRESS emerges from the bar. Richard is fast on her heels.
          He exits, making conversation as he quickly locks the doors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         92

                         RIC
          Hey -o- wait up.

                         WAITRESS
          Good night, Richard. See ya tomorrows
          She starts to walk to her car- He catches up to her,
          accompanying her to her car.

                         RIC
          You want to come over for a drink? Just a
          drink.
          She stops in front of her car.

                         WAITRESS
          No, thanks. Maybe some other night.
          He stands in front of his Brown Suburban, watching as the
          Waitress gets in her car, pulls away and leaves.

                         RICHARD
          Fuckin' bitch.
          He turns and freezes.
          Matt Fowler stands a few feet away, an Ortaies calibre
          7.65 automatic directly at Richard's face. His gloved hand poin
          grips the gun tightly.

                         RICHARD
          Dr. Fowler?

                         MATT
          Don't talk. Unlock it and get in.

                         RIC
          He . wait a minute. Let's, let's just
          calm down...
          Matt COCKS the gun.

                         RIC
          Alright! Shit.
          Richard obeys. He unlocks both doors.
          Matt opens the back door, but stays planted, the gun trained on
          Richard.
          Richard gets in the driver's seat. Matt climbs in the back.
          He presses the gun's muzzle against the back of Richard's head.

          V 0-,

                         MATT
          Is there any one at your place?

                         RIC

                         (IRONICALLY)

                         NOT TONIGHT

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         93

                         MATT
          Good. Drive there.
          Richard looks over his shoulder to back the car up.
          Matt aims at his temple, but does not look at his eyes.
          Richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive.

                         MATT
          Drive slowly - don't try to get stopped.

          EXT. PETER'S PARKING LOT ALLEY

          Matt can see the ocean. He uncocks the revolver.
          Matt cracks the window.
          Matt leans down in his seat. He transfers the gun into his
          left hand, removes the glove from his right, and wipes the
          sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg. He puts the glove
          back on, gripping the gun.
          Richard's Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun
          Park and turns onto a deserted Main Street.

          INT/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN - NIGHT

          They drive back through town, the sea wall on their left hiding
          the beach.
          on the right are the places, most with their neon signs off,
          that do so much business in s er: the lounges and cafes and
          pizza houses. The street itself empty of traffic.

                         RICHARD
          He was making it with my wife.
          His voice is careful, not pleading.
          Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head.
          Richard flinches and moves his head forward.
          Matt lowers the gun to his lap.

                         MATT
          Don-t talk.

          /EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - NIGHT

          The Brown Suburban slowly pulls up to the front.
          Matt leans forward. Th. muzzle grazing Richard's head.
          Drive it to the back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         91+

                         RIC
          You wouldn't have it cocked, would you?
          For when I put on the brakes.
          Matt COCKS it.
          It is now.
          Richard tenses. He drives around the side of the building.

          EXT. RICHARD STROUT'S DUPLEX BACK YARD - NIGHT

          The Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and
          brakes. The engine shuts off.
          Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard. He gets
          out and shuts the door with his hip.

                         MATT
          All right.
          Richard looks at the gun, then gets out. He moves across the
          grass.
          Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on
          either side of them and scattered tall trees.
          He glances from house to house. Looking for signs of one
          insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching
          the all-night channel from Boston. All is quiet.
          They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door.
          Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door.
          It-s pitch black inside the duplex.

                         MATT
          Turn on the light.
          Richard flips the wall switch.
          in the light.
          Matt stares at his wide back, and long reach.

          I NT. RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - KITCHEN NIGHT
          Richard stops just inside the kitchen. Matt closes the door
          softly behind gim.

                         MATT
          Where-s you r suitcase?
          Richard almost turns around.

                         RIC
          My suitcase?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         95
          Matt grips the gun tighter, straining to keep it from
          ling.

                         MATT
          Where is it?

                         RIC
          in the bedroom closet.

                         MATT
          That's where were going then. When we get
          to a door you stop and turn on the light.
          They cross the kitchen.
          Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and
          refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack
          beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator
          clean and white.
          Matt becomes momentarily 2reoccupied with one of Duncan's
          drawings taped to its door.

                         MATT
          Wait.
          Richard stops.
          Matt looks conflicted. Doubt has crept into his face For a
          moment he seems to have lost his resolve.

          RICHARD O.S.

                         (IRRITATED)
          .Jesus.
          Matt looks to Richard with a renewed sense of purpose.

                         TT
          .keep going.

                         LIVING ROOM
          A light flicks on. They take the hall past the living room.
          Matt doesn't want to see anymore of Richard's life. But he
          can't help h° elf. He takes it all in: Magazines and
          newspapers in a wicker basket, clean ashtrays, a stereo,
          CD's neatly shelved next to it.
          They continue down a hallway.Richard stops outside a door.

                         RIC
          There's no wall switch.

                         MATT
          Where's the light?

                         RIC
          the bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         96
          Let's go.
          Richard steps into the darkness. Matt is careful to stay a
          pace behind. Richard leans over by the bed. Matt braces.
          lick. A small bedside lamp turns on.
          The bed, a double one, is neatly made; the ashtray on the
          bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no
          photographs- prob ly so the girl - who is scae? - won't have
          to see Natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs. But
          because Matt is a father and a husband, thou h never ex-
          husband, he knows (and does not want to ow that this
          bedroom has never been theirs alone.
          Richard turns around; Matt looks at his lips, his wide jaw.

                         RICHARD
          I wanted to work things out with her.
          Try to get together with her again.
          But I couldn't even talk to her.
          He was always with her.
          Dr. Fowler, I'm going to jail for it.
          I am going to jail. If I ever get out
          I'll be an old man. Isn't that enough ?

                         MAXT
          You're not going to jail.
          Pack clothes for warm weather.

                         RIC
          What's going on? You're not gonna let me
          go!
          Matt looks away. He doesn't answer.

                         RICHARD
          Dr. Fowler?

                         MATT
          You're jumping bail.

                         RIC
          .Dr. Fowler.
          Matt points the pistol at Richard's face. The barrel trembles
          a little.
           Richard reaches up into his closet and pulls out two large
          canvas bags. He places them on the - He pulls a third
          bag, a small, red, woman's suitcase, Natalie's no doubt, next
          to the others.
          He moves to the bureau.

                         MATT
          It's the trial. We can't go through that,
          my wife and me. So you're leaving. I've
          got you a ticket. My wife keeps seeing
          you. I can't have that anymore...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         97

                         RIC
          He was making it with my wife.
          I'd go pick up my kids and he'd be there.
          Sometimes he spent the night. Duncan
          told me.
          He doesn't look at Matt as he speaks. He opens the to
          ewer. Matt steps closer so he can see Richard's hangs. 
          underwear and the socks rolled, the underwear folded and
          stacked. Richard arranges them neatly in the suitcase. The
          kitchen the livin room the clothes. Matt is struck b
          this man's sense of order, o iscio ine.
          Matt watches the absurdity of Richard sorting clothes by
          season. He even packs a small instamatic camera. He packs
          the things a man accumulates and become part of him.

                         MATT
          (re: the suitcases)
          Okay, that's enough.

                         RICHARD
          I need some things from the bathroom.

                         MATT
          alright.

                         THE BATHROOM
          Richard steps just inside the bathroom door and stops.

                         MATT
          Keep going.

                         RICHARD
          Gotta pee.
          Matt realizes Richard means to have privacy.
          He pushes him into the room. Takes a step back and pulls the
          door so it is only slightly ajar. He keeps his foot between
          the jam and the door.
          He eyes Richard's back reflected in the mirror. He can hear
          him make water. He looks like he wonders about allowing this
          courtesy.
          Mattes glances at:
          A picture on the wall outside of the bathroom: Natalie
          Richard and their two boys, in front of someone's house.
          Smiling. She looks happy.

                         C
          looks around the room frantically - his eyes find nothing
          that will help his situation - he flushes the toilet - Matt
          swings the door fully open - Richard fills a travel kit with
          toiletries.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         98

                         RICHARD'S BEDROOM
          Richard tucks the travel kit into a bag. Matt keeps the gun
          on him.
          Richard closes the suitcase, and faces Matt. He looks at the
          Matt moves around behind him. Now Richard is between Matt
          and the lighted hall. Richard carries a canvas bag in each
          hand. Matt pulls another glove from his pocket. He uses it
          to turn off the bedside lamp. Richard now d'_lhouetted in
          the doorway.
          Let's go.
          Richard steps into the hall. Matt follows, carrying the small
          suitcase in one hand, the gun in the other.
          They start down the hallway. Matt turns off lights with his
          elbow as they go. Past the living room into the kitchen.
          Wait.
          Richard tenses, he stops at the kitchen door.
          Matt sets the suitcase down. He uses that hand to reach into
          his jacket. He pulls out a red, white, and blue piece of
          paper. He drops it on the counter top. Words on the paper
          read AMT RACK.
          Matt picks up the suitcase again. He steps closer to him.
          Presses the gun into Richard's back.

                         MATT
          open the door.
          Richard's reaches down and carefully turns the knob. He
          slowly pulls the door open. Matt takes a step back.

          Get the light.
          Richard reaches down and hits the switch. Click. The two men

          Matt keeps the gun steady as Richard pops open the hatch and
          loads the bags. Matt sets the small suitcase at Richard's feet.
          He reaches down and loads it last.

          Richard gets into the driver's seat. Matt in the back.

          with the desperate eyes.

          wouldn't have done it myself if it was
          that easy?
          Silence.
          He starts it up, slides into reverse. He looks back over his
          shoulder as they back down the driveway. Matt averts his stare.
          Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face
          beyond it.

          It's for you're car. You don't think we'd
          leave it at the airport do you?

          MATT WATCHES RIC S LARGE, BIG KNUCKLED HANDS TIGHTEN ON THE WHEEL.
          They crawl up the trail, the wheels crunching the gravel, the
          headlights shining into the dense woods.
          The road seems endless. Richard cringes as they bounce over a
          bump.
          Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield.
          Finally, at a great distance, the tiny lit windows of a cabin
          come into view. A BLUE CHEVY PICKUP is parked in front of the
          place.

                         MATT
          Stop here.
          The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop. Richard keeps the engine
          running. Matt presses the gun hard against his neck. He
          straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror.
          Matt's eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before
          focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel.

          Turn it off.
          Richard does. The ball game disappears, and the silence is

          Richard carefully gets out. Instinctively, he raises his hands
          about shoulder level. They move to the back of the Brown
          Suburban. Richard pops the hatch.
          He pulls out the two canvas bags. He sets them on the ground.
          He reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase.
          We hear a SCREEN DOOR slam shut. Richard looks surprised.
          He turns back to Matt.
          C'mon now.
          Richard reaches down and picks up the bags. He struggles to
          carry all three.
          Matt grabs the small suitcase from him.

          Richard lugs the bags toward the cabin.

          STEPS FORWARD, RAISES THE GUN AND FIRES ONE MORE SHOT.

          RICHARD STOPS MOVING.
          Matt stands there motionless.

          Willis runs up to Matt.

          We were going to wait, and take him out in

          large, well-dug hole. Together, they drag the body t he edge
          of the hole. Move behind it. Lift the legs, and push it in.

          THE WOODS - LATER -
          Willis and Matt come up from the woods. They carry Richard's
          lug age. Willis drops the canvas bags into the hole. Matt
          loo s at the suitcase and then drops it in.
          Willis takes a couple of steps away, and grabs two shovels
          leaning against a small birch. He hands one to Matt.
          Together, they begin filling in the hole.

          Matt holds the flashlight as Willis sprinkles leaves and
          branches over the hole.
          Willis freezes, as if he has heard something. Matt cuts the
          light.
          They hear some footsteps approaching, closer, then they see it -

          the Ford, and gets in the passenger side. They drive off.

          /EXT- WISSC SET BRIDGE - S
          Willis's car moves slowly over the channel bridge, back to
          Wiscasset.
          Matt rolls down his window. Be tosses Richard°s keys over the side of
          the brad e . The trim shapes of lobster boats and smal craft anchored
          in t he hExbor below, loo like old toys in a bathtub,
          He rolls up the window as the car continues across.
          Both men silent, lost in thought, staring out the windshield at
          the road ahead.

          Matt checks his watch.

                         MATT
          Ten to six. We lost an hour. Sorry.
          Willis's jaw tightens.

                         WIILLIS
          (almost losing his temper)
          Yep...high tide. Can't stop people from
          fish'in Matt - uck'in brides
          Matt looks over at Willis.

                         MATT
          I'm sor Willis.
          Willis looks at Matt. He knows. Eyes back to the road.

                         WILLIS

                         (FORCED CALM)
          Stopped in to his little shed there once
          place reeked ...the guy's spilled more
          whiskey than we've ever drunk. Just pray
          he's already three sheets to the wind.
          Matt doesn't reply.

          The Ford pulls up to the curb. Matt gets out.
          Willis drives away.
          Matt starts walking.

          EXT. F RSTREET -S

          The STREET LIGHTS suddenly turn off',.
          The world is waking up now.

          EXT. FOWLER STREET - S

          In the distance, Matt can see his house.
          The birds all seem to wake at once.
          Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just
          kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue. The
          surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep.
          He picks up his pace.

          Matt enters.

          T LAUNDRY ROOM - S
          He roves his tennis shoes, his pants, he starts unbuttoning
          his shirt. Now in his T-shirt and boxers, he examines his
          clothes and shoes carefully, before putting them into the
          washer - He pours detergent inside - and starts the cycle.
          He steps to a little sink and washes up.

                         DINING ROOM
          The light has been left on, he kills it and heads upstairs.

          Matt slowly walks down the hall, to

                         BEDROOM -S
          And stands in the doorway. He pauses, seeing only
          the orange ember of Ruth's cigarette, in the dark.

          He doesn-t answer. He walks in and comes to bed, climbing in as
          Ruth moves over.

                         RUTH
          Are you all right?
          He lies down. FACES THE WINDOW, AWAY FROM HER.
          She is on her side, she props herself up on her elbow -
          watching him.
          He waits a longtime before speaking

                         MATT
          There was a picture with Natalie and the
          boys hanging on his wall -
          Ruth looks at him strangely.

          What?

                         MATT
          I don't know -
          Ruth looks at the back of Matt's head.

                         RUTH
          Matt?
          He doesn't move. He says nothing else.
          She continues to stare at him.
          Uncertainty beginning to form on her face. She looks lost. If only
          things cou d be as t ey were.
          Then.

                         RUTH
          at I thinking - you must be hungry.
          She waits for a response, but gets e. She gets out of bed,
          leaves the room and heads down stairs.

          Matt dear, do you want coffee?
          Be doesn't respond. Instead he looks at his finger.
          The bandage wet from washing up.
          He slides it off easily, like oversized ring.
          The skin has healed.

                         LATER NOW
          Sun light creeps in through the curtains, onto Matt's face.
          Ruth lies sleeping on his chest.
          A breakfast tray at his bedside which he hasn't touched
          Matt is cede awake. He stares at the ceiling Reliving it
          His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness.
          The lids heavy. If only he could sleep.
          But he won't. Not today.
          There is a small crack in the ceiling.
          He'll have to fix that.

             FADE IN:

             On credit sequence...

             AN ARM

             stretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH
             CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender
             strokes. 

             A TUMBLE OF HAIR
 
             thick and auburn.  Being gently washed.  

             FINGERNAILS

             being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform.
             Tidy.

             EYEBROWS

             brown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view.
             Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against.
             Then back again.

             PANTY-HOSE

             pulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash
             cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water.

             HAIR

             now dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through
             the thick tresses.

             It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL
             GLOVE.

             The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from
             it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we
             see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail
             clippings.

             Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb
             through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised,
             her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor.

             Dead.

             End of credit sequence.

             INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY

             The loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy
             window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.

                                 HAP (O.S.)
                       Jesus.  Just look at all that.

             PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side
             by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little
             pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle
             Times.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       I thought we had a population problem.
                       Everyone should just move up here.
                           (taps window)
                       Just look at it, Will.

             Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.

                                 WILL
                       I don't need to look at it.

             Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.
             Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a
             distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.
     
                                 HAP
                       Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.

             Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his
             Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just
             below the surface.  He taps the file.

                                 WILL
                       Tell that to her, partner.

             ANGLE ON THE FILE

             a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes
             puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along
             her breasts and shoulders.

                                 PILOT (O.S.)
                       Detective?

             The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red
             baron hat.

                                 PILOT (cont'd)
                       Better check your belts.  We'll be
                       landing in about fifteen minutes.

             Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor
             and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of
             them.  Looks at Will.

             EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS

             The small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and
             gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green
             of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock
             of the beaches.  Enormous.


             EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut
             Fishing Capital of the World!

             PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,
             corrugated building.  The "airport."  Nothing else for miles
             around.

             A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes
             SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with
             short, brown hair.

             Peers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH
             PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest.
             Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous.
             Excited.

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)
                       Eleanor?

             ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN
             hosing down the side of the building.

                                 ELLIE
                       Hey, Mr. Angstrom!

                                 MR. ANGSTROM
                       What're you doing here?

             Ellie puffs up.

                                 ELLIE
                       Police business.

                                 MR. ANGSTROM
                       Police business?

             The old man screws up his face, confused.  

                                 MR. ANGSTROM (cont'd)
                       Didn't you used to baby-sit for us? 

                                 ELLIE
                       I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom.
                       Just made detective three weeks ago.

             A CAT jumps down off the roof.  Angstrom sprays it.

                                 MR. ANGSTROM
                       Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at
                       the station.

             Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  Turns back to THE
             ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  Coming to
             a stop.  She hurries over as the door swings open and...

             WILL DORMER steps down.  Slipping on his sunglasses.
             Scanning the nothingness around him.  Spots the swinging
             sign.

                                 WILL
                       "Halibut fishing capital of the world."

             Hap, right behind him.  Rubs his neck.

                                 HAP
                       This ought to be interesting.

                                 ELLIE
                           (over the engine)
                       Detective Dormer!

             They look down.  Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.  Then
             his hand.  Shakes it vigorously.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       It's a huge honor to meet you!  Ellie
                       Burr.  I'm here to take you to the
                       station!

             Will motions to Hap.

                                 WILL
                       My partner...

                                 ELLIE
                       Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to
                       Nightmute!

             She leads them away from the plane.  Takes Will's briefcase.

                                 ELLIE
                       I just want to say how incredible it is 
                       to have you working with us, Detective
                       Dormer.  I've followed all your cases.
                       Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey
                       Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings...

             Opens the back of the Jeep.  Puts the bags inside.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       ...And especially the Leland Street
                       Murders.  That was my case study at the
                       Academy.

             The Pilot walks by.  Taps her on the shoulder.

                                 PILOT
                       Tell your dad the game's gonna start late
                       this week, Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                       Sure thing, Spence.

             She looks back at Will.  Can't help but focus in on his scar.
             Touches her own smooth neck.  In awe.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       That's where Ronald Langley cut you in
                       the basement of his father's house on 325
                       Leland, isn't it?

             Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.

                                 WILL
                       You did your homework, Officer.

                                 ELLIE
                       Actually...

             She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.  Out of ear-shot.

                                 ELLIE
                       I just made detective three weeks ago.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one-
             storey building.  The Nightmute Police Department.  A totem
             pole stands out front.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
                       Will Dormer!

             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

             Nightmute Police Chief CHARLES NYBACK gets up from behind his
             desk with a big smile.  Ruddy, red hair sprinkled with grey,
             Nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I'll be damned!

             Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap
             on the back.

                                 WILL
                           (warmly)
                       How you doing, Charlie?

             Nyback shakes Hap's hand.  A reunion.

                                 HAP
                       Hey, Charlie.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Christ.  I haven't seen you boys since...

                                 WILL
                       Just after Leland Street.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       What's that, then?

                                 HAP
                       Eight years.

                                 WILL
                       Seven years.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Seven years?  Where does it all go?  That
                       was some amazing time, though, wasn't it?

             Looks at Will.  Down at his boots.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       You haven't changed a bit, Will.

             Will.  Looks at Nyback's gut.

                                 WILL
                       You have, Chief.

             They LAUGH.  Eyes twinkling.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I knew that was coming.  I deserve it.

             He starts back over to his desk.  Notices Ellie still
             standing by the door.  Points to Will.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Pay attention to this man, Ellie.  He'll
                       teach you how to be a great cop.

             Ellie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will.

                                 ELLIE
                       Yes, sir.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       That's all, for now.

             Ellie, realises they want to be alone.

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh.  Right.  Okay.

             Backs out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will
             unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat.

                                 WILL
                       Nice kid.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                           (sits with a SIGH)
                       Got a love affair with police work.
                       Drives me crazy with it.

             Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack.

                                 WILL
                       Keeping you busy up here, Charlie?

             Hap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base.

                                 HAP
                       "2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch."

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I told you seven years ago this was a 
                       stepping stone to retirement.

             Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  "Deeper
             Investigation into Special Branch"...

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Looks like it's a good time for you to
                       get up here, too.  With all the bad
                       business going on down at Special Branch.

             Will and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over
             the paper.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Just five bad apples so far?

                                 WILL
                       So far.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       What's the D.A. got them on?

                                 WILL
                       Four unwarranted shootings, witness
                       intimidation, and cocaine theft.

             Nyback winces.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       How about you?  How you faring?

                                 HAP
                       They're all over us, Charlie.

                                 WILL
                       They're all over everybody.

                                 HAP
                       I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption
                       Task Force."  Can you believe that?
                       Trying to root out any mistakes or
                       "oversights" any other Detectives may
                       have made over the years.  They're
                       turning it into a witch hunt.  Something
                       on the news about it practically every
                       night.

             Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Got a bunch of messages here from some
                       guy named Warfield.

             Hap tosses a glance over at Will.

                                 WILL
                       That's I.A.'s pit bull.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Wants me to keep him posted on all your
                       movements up here.

             Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the
             trash.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       I'm just glad Buck could spare you a
                       couple of weeks.  Take you out of the
                       frenzy.  I gotta tell you, though, I sure
                       don't miss big city police work.  Not
                       that I was ever a great detective.  But
                       up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No
                       Public Relations.  No blurred lines.
                       Just good guys and bad guys.  Simple.

             A cloud passes over his face.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Except for this.

             Holds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL.

             INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

             Nyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway.  Crooked plaques
             and black-and-white pictures line the walls.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not
                       a trace.  Town's never dealt with
                       anything like this before.

             They turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up:
             MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       I've briefed everybody about your coming.
                       They know to follow your lead.

             Nyback opens the door onto...

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

             ...the bullpen of Nightmute PD.  Wooden desks, a couple
             computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet.  A
             RADIO's playing.

             Three MEN look over.  A young uniformed cop and two guys with
             heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts.  One
             of them's part Inuit.  Ellie sits in the back.  Reaches over
             to turn off the radio.

             Will and Hap stand in the doorway.  Sticking out like sore
             thumbs in their suits.  Nyback jerks his thumb towards them.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       This is Detective Dormer and his partner
                       Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck
                       Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide
                       Special Branch.  They'll be helping with
                       the Connell case.

             The Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk.

                                 FRED
                       Helping?  

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                           (ignoring him)
                       Anything they need to see, you show them;
                       anywhere they want to go, you take them.
                           (nods to Fred)
                       This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been
                       leading the investigation up to now.

             Will puts out his hand.

                                 WILL
                       Detective...

             Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  Stands.

                                 FRED
                       Suppose you want to see the body.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             Fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap.

                                 FRED
                       We can walk from here.

             He heads off across the parking lot.  Will and Hap exchange a
             glance.

                                 WILL
                       Guess that's what they call Alaskan
                       hospitality.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Don't worry about him...

             They turn.  Ellie's come up behind them.  Looks over at the
             hunched figure to Fred.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       He's just mad 'cause you're taking over.

             Fred stops up ahead.  Sees her.  Annoyed.

                                 FRED
                       Ellie!  Go type something!

             INT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - LATER

             CLOSE ON a faucet.  A bead of water, quivering at the mouth.
             Falls with a BLIP!

                                 CORONER (O.S.)
                       Did a fundascopic examination and found
                       papilledema and petechiae of the retina.

             PULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER
             standing by a stainless steel table.  The naked body of KAY
             CONNELL is laid out before them.  Fred hangs back.

             The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  She's in her late
             seventies.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       Clear cause of death was herniation of
                       the brain stem due to intracerebral
                       hemorrhage.

                                 HAP
                       Beaten to death.

                                 CORONER
                       Beaten to death.

             Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and
             breasts.

                                 WILL
                       What about these contusions?

                                 CORONER
                       Superficial.

                                 WILL
                       Any signs of rape?

                                 CORONER
                       None.

             The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       She was a nice girl.  Played flute with
                       my granddaughter.

             Will stays her hand.

                                 WILL
                       Wait.

             He pulls the sheet back down.  Studying the body of Kay
             Connell.  Starts walking slowly around the table.  In his
             element.  The faucet drips.  Drips.  Drips.

             He bends down to smell her hair.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       He washed her hair.

             Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Combed it.

             Continues around the table.  Picks up one of her hands.
             Examines her fingers, her nails.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Cleaned under her fingernails.  Clipped
                       them.

             Continues down around her feet.  Checks between her first and
             second toes.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Toes, too.
                           (to Fred)
                       You found nothing on the body?

                                 FRED
                       No.
 
                                 WILL
                       No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...

                                 FRED
                       Like I said, no.  We know about those
                       things up here.

             Will stands there.  Looking down at the body.  Slim.  Young.
             Beautiful.  Skin like marble.

                                 WILL
                       He knew exactly what we'd be looking for.
                       Made sure to cover up all his tracks.

                                 HAP
                       Even the best make mistakes.

             Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner.

             INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             Will and Hap enter the lobby of the Pioneer Lodge.  Big stone
             fireplace and heavy ceiling beams.  MOOSE ANTLERS mounted
             above reception.  They put their bags down by the desk.  Look
             around.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                       Lower forty-eight.

             They turn.  RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the
             desk.  Dunking a teabag into a mug.  Long dark hair and
             intelligent eyes.

                                 HAP
                       Lower forty-eight?

                                 RACHEL
                       You're not from here.  I can tell by your
                       walk.

                                 HAP
                       Oh?  And how's that?

                                 RACHEL
                       Unsure.

             Hap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch.

                                 WILL
                       Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart.
                       There should be a reservation for us.

             Rachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk.

                                 RACHEL
                           (to Hap)
                       Your friend's all business.

                                 WILL
                       I'm always all business.

             He glances out the window.  It's as bright as day.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Is it really 9:30?

                                 RACHEL
                           (nods)
                       Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy
                       sleeper.  It'll be like this all night.

             She hands them two cards.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

             Will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking.  The room is
             sparse and creaky.  Bed dips in the middle.  He hangs a
             jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase.  Pulls
             out his SMITH AND WESSON 45.

             Lays it on the bedside table.  Takes out a shoulder holster.
             A back holster.  A handful of shells.  Lays them on the 
             table.  Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM.  Checks the
             magazine.

             There's a KNOCK on the adjoining door.

                                 HAP (O.S.)
                       Me.

             Will SLAPS the magazine back.

                                 WILL
                       Come on in.

             Hap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES
             on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.

                                 HAP
                       See you have the same decor as my room.

             He walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor.
             Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT
             in the harbor towing a freighter.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       Same view, too.
                           (looks out)
                       I've been watching that tugboat for the
                       last half hour.  So small, pulling all
                       that weight.
                           (beat)
                       We have to talk, Will.

             Will reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt.

                                 WILL 
                       What do you want to talk about?

                                 HAP
                       You know what about.

             Will throws him a look.

                                 WILL
                       We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.

                                 HAP
                       When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...
                           (heads over to him)
                       We have to figure out a plan of action
                       now.

                                 WILL
                       You know my plan of action.

                                 HAP
                       To do nothing.

                                 WILL
                       That's right.

                                 HAP
                       Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up
                       in his office again for five hours
                       yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds
                       of questions...

                                 WILL
                       He's asking everybody questions.

                                 HAP
                       But he's zeroing in on me.  On us.
                       Everyone's talking about it.

                                 WILL
                       He's just rattling your cage.

                                 HAP
                       Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife,
                       three kids, and a pension plan in the
                       balance, it's rattling hard.

                                 WILL
                       We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as
                       that.

             Will goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of
             sweat on his upper lip.

                                 HAP
                           (lowers voice)
                       Look.  We've tampered with evidence.
                       We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted
                       shit.  And they're sniffing around like
                       dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case...

             Will flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner.

                                 WILL
                       Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy
                       and left him hanging in the basement like
                       a piece of meat.  You remember that?

                                 HAP
                       You know I remember that.

                                 WILL
                       One word to I.A. and he walks.

                                 HAP
                       Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...

                                 WILL
                       No way.

                                 HAP
                       Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's 
                       what Flynn's doing...

                                 WILL
                       Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are
                       nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we
                       needed to do to make sure that son-of-
                       bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And
                       every bastard like him.  We say one word
                       about it and every case we ever brought
                       in is going to blow wide open and they'll
                       all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not
                       going to let that happen.  No deals.  No
                       compromises.  No discussions.

             He grabs a hanger.

                                 HAP
                       Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to
                       something and you don't let it go.

             He takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow.

                                 HAP
                       I don't know if it's because you think
                       it's the right thing to do or because
                       your pride won't let you do anything
                       else.  I can't tell any more.
                           (steps back)
                       But I can tell you one thing.  I'm
                       getting too old for this cowboy cop
                       stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up
                       messes.  We're a dying breed, Will.
                       You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A.,
                       all those reporters - they don't care
                       what you did at Leland Street seven years
                       ago.  They don't care that you've made
                       this your life.  They don't care about
                       getting the bad guy...

             Will turns on his partner, eyes burning.

                                 WILL
                       I care.

             The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A
             thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                        They're watching us, Will.  Like it or
                        not.  They're watching us.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

             Will's asleep.  Kay Connell's folder open on his chest.  It's
             dark in his room, quiet.  Suddenly the shade on his window
             quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.

             Will's eyes pop open.  He rolls over to look at the clock:
             3:15.  Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.
             We can see the rest of his scar.  Runs down deep across his
             sternum.

             He yanks the shade back down.  It bucks, then settles.
             Satisfied, Will returns to bed.  Plumps the pillow, pulls the
             blanket up around him.  Closes his eyes.

             The shade lurches halfway.  Then SNAPS back up.  Light pours
             in.  Will's eyes open.

                                 WILL
                       You got to be kidding me.

             EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat
             around his collar.  He looks out over the harbor.  Fishing
             boats coming in with their early morning haul.  More halibut.
             He checks his watch.  Slows to a walk.  Looks up and sees...

             Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
             Smiles.  Holds up some car keys.

                                 ELLIE
                       Fred wants us to meet him at the
                       Connell's.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY

             Ellie driving.  A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view
             mirror.  Will in the passenger seat.  Wearing a crisp suit.
             Ellie hands him a take-out bag.

                                 ELLIE
                       Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case
                       you were hungry.

             Will takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Local delicacy.

                                 WILL
                       Think I'll pass.

             He puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window.
             Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished
             Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front:
             Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       What kind of calls you get around here?

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff.
                       Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly
                       drinking-related problems.  Domestic
                       abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that.

             She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       In the summer months it's pretty quiet.
                       That's when there's work out on the
                       boats.  The rest of the year, though...

             They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking
             stick.  Ellie calls out the window.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Hey, there, Joe!

             JOE waves.  They pass.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       That's Joe Willy.  Took his family 
                       hostage in November.  That was the most
                       exciting thing that happened last year.
                       I wasn't there, though.
                           (grinds gear)
                       Chief barely lets me handle anything
                       above a misdemeanor.

             Will looks over at her.  Smiles.

                                 WILL
                       Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.

                                 ELLIE
                       But they're so boring.  All small stuff.

                                 WILL
                       It's all about the small stuff.  Small
                       lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights.
                       People give themselves away in a traffic
                       violation just as much as they do in a
                       murder case.  It's human nature.

             He looks over.  Ellie's listening intently.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Aren't you going to write that down?

             Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...

                                 ELLIE
                       Let me just...

             Stops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her.

             EXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY

             A small ranch house.  Aluminum siding.  FLOWERS piled up by
             the front door.  TEDDY BEARS.  RIBBONS.  Left by well-wishers.

                                 MRS. CONNELL (O.S.)
                       I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me
                       not to touch anything.

             INT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             MRS. CONNELL, a big woman with a thick grey braid down her
             back, opens the door to her daughter's room.  Looks at Will.

                                 MRS. CONNELL
                       I don't believe in keeping a child's room
                       like a shrine.

             Will heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable
             uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the
             doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go.

             INT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             A small bedroom.  Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on
             the ceiling.  Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the
             walls.  A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner.

             Will stands in the middle of the room.  Taking it in.

                                 WILL
                       Typical seventeen year-old.
                           (beat)
                       She went to a party Friday night?

                                 ELLIE
                       Down at a local dive the kids like to
                       hang out in.

             Fred throws Ellie a look.  "Kids?"  She's practically a kid
             herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots
             beneath the panties.

                                 WILL
                       No diary.

             On top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up.
             Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing.

                                 FRED
                       She left the party early.  Friends said
                       she had a fight with her boyfriend and
                       stormed out.

                                 WILL
                       What time was that?

                                 FRED
                       Around twelve-thirty.

             Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he
             shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner.

                                 WILL
                       Who was the last one to see her alive?

                                 FRED
                       Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've
                       questioned him, searched his place.
                       Didn't find anything.

             Will pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant.
             The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another.
             Feels the fabric.

                                 WILL
                       These are designer.  Expensive.
                           (looks up)
                       Could Randy Stetz afford these?

             Fred and Ellie exchange a look.

                                 ELLIE
                       He fixes boat engines.

             Will looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens.

                                 WILL
                       Well her mother didn't buy them for her.

                                 HAP
                       What are we thinking?

             Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table.
             Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up.

                                 WILL
                       Kay Connell had an admirer.

             He hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I want to talk to the boyfriend.

             INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

             CLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder.  Hard.

                                 WILL
                       You don't seem all that sad.

             The shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ
             sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish
             blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to
             grow a moustache.

                                 RANDY
                       I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been
                       all over my back since Monday!

             He takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap
             sits opposite.

                                 HAP
                       You know smoking stunts your growth.

             Randy throws him a look.

                                 RANDY
                       Yeah, okay, fat-ass.

                                 HAP
                           (smiles at Will)
                       More Alaskan hospitality.

             Will goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup.

                                 WILL
                       Did you love her?

                                 RANDY
                       Huh?

                                 WILL
                       Kay Connell.  Did you love her?

             Randy flicks his ash.  Shrugs.

                                 RANDY
                       Sure.  She was nice.

             Will turns with his coffee.

                                 WILL
                       "She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all
                       soft inside.  Ever occur to you she
                       didn't love you back?

                                 RANDY
                       Huh?

                                 WILL
                       You heard me that time.

                                 RANDY
                       She loved me.  She wanted to see me every
                       night.

                                 WILL
                       But she was seeing someone else on the
                       side.

             Randy glares.

                                 RANDY
                       I don't know what you're fucking talking
                       about.

                                 WILL
                       Friday night, at the party - what'd you
                       fight about?

                                 RANDY
                       Stuff.

                                 WILL
                       What kind of stuff?

                                 RANDY
                       Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.

                                 WILL
                       The other guy?

                                 RANDY
                       I told you I don't remember.

                                 WILL
                       After that she left the party to go to
                       him.

                                 RANDY
                       How should I know?...

                                 WILL
                       Ran like hell to go to him...

                                 RANDY
                       Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your
                       fucking cop questions...

             Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the
             collar.  Nose to nose.

                                 WILL
                       Now you listen to me, you little shit.
                       This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt 
                       crap may work with your mamma, but it
                       doesn't work with me.  You got mad at
                       your girlfriend because she was seeing
                       someone else.  You want to be the last
                       person who saw her alive or are you going
                       to tell me who that is?

             Randy's lip curls.  Red-faced.

                                 RANDY
                       I don't know.

                                 WILL
                       You don't know.

                                 RANDY
                       She didn't tell me.

             Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat.

             INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

             Will walking out of the interrogation room.  Ellie joins him.

                                 ELLIE
                       He's a little surly, isn't he?

             Will smooths back his hair.  Checks his tie.

                                 WILL
                       Just a little.

             He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace
             from Kay's room.  Hands it to her.

                                 WILL
                       I want you to check this out, Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                       We already did.

                                 WILL
                       Do it again.

                                 ELLIE
                       But there wasn't any...

             Will stops.  Ellie stops.  Will puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 WILL
                       The small things - remember?  The second
                       you're about to dismiss something - look
                       at it again.

             Ellie smiles, teasing.

                                 ELLIE
                       You want me to write that down?

             Will, has to smile.  She's quick.  Looks down the hall.  A
             bearded GUY on crutches.  Ellie follows his gaze.

                                 WILL
                       Who's that?

                                 ELLIE
                       The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there
                       Friday night.

                                 WILL
                       Good.  He's up next.

             Will heads over to him.  Ellie watches his neck.  Her hand
             closing over the necklace.

             INT. RESTAURANT - PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT

             The Pioneer Lodge restaurant.  Small, dark wood, a RADIO
             playing something between Bluegrass and Folk.  Some rough-
             looking GUYS at the bar.  Throwing looks over at...

             Will and Hap, sitting at a table.  Studying faded menus.

                                 WILL
                           (reading)
                       Halibut Calabrese.  Halibut Olympia.
                       Halibut Cajun Style.  Halibut fish and
                       chips...

             He puts down his menu.  Reaches for his drink.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Can't wait to see what's for dessert.

                                 HAP
                       At least there's variety.

             Will drains his drink.  Locks eyes with a big GUY over at the
             bar.  Beer froth on his moustache.

                                 WILL
                       Looks like the natives are restless.

                                 HAP
                       Will?

             Will looks back at his partner.  Hap's fidgeting with the end
             of his tie.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       I think, I think I'm gonna talk to Buck
                       when we get back to Seattle.

             A cold flash down Will's spine.

                                 HAP
                       I wish I could stick it out like you.  I
                       just, with Trish and the kids...

                                 WILL
                       Don't do this, Hap...

             Hap avoids his eyes.

                                 HAP
                       I'm thinking I could get off with
                       probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's
                       all I want.

                                 WILL
                           (hisses)
                       Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're
                       doing...

                                 HAP
                       You don't have to be involved, Will.

                                 WILL
                       You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I
                       like it or not...

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                       Ready to order?

             The men look up, interrupted.  Rachel is standing by the
             table with a pad.  Hap tries to recover with a big smile.

                                 HAP
                       Hey - you do everything around here?

                                 RACHEL
                       Just about.

             Will stands abruptly.  Eyes on Hap.  Trying not to explode.

                                 WILL
                       I'll just have another Scotch in my room.
                           (turns to Rachel)
                       If you don't mind.

             Just then, his cell phone RINGS.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - NIGHT

             Will bursts into the bullpen.  Hap behind.

                                 WILL
                       Where is it?

             Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk.

                                 ELLIE
                       Over here.

             Will and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys,
             FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt
             into his dirty jeans.

             They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud
             spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it.

                                 WILL
                       We're sure it's hers?

                                 FRED
                       Has her books in it.

                                 HAP
                       What about prints?

             Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into
             the bag.  Pulls out two text books.

                                 WILL
                       Biology and Algebra.

             He shoves the books towards one of the guys.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Find out who she studied with.

             He continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag
             with "Hello Kittys" all over it.  Dumps out the contents.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Make-up.

             Looks up at Fred.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Find out where she bought it.

             Fred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls
             out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Lab.

             Next, a couple worn paperbacks.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                           (reading titles)
                       Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset.

             He looks up at the group.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Who here reads this kind of crap?

             Farrell straightens.

                                 FARRELL
                       I read that kind of crap.

             Will tosses them to him.

                                 WILL
                       Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes
                       you.

             Down to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten
             sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Lab.

             Upends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       That's it.

             Fred reaches for the knapsack.

                                 FRED
                       I'll stick it in the evidence locker...

                                 WILL
                       No.

             Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking.
             Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the
     
             TOTEM POLE standing tall outside.  A black RAVEN alights on
             top of it.  Pecks at the air.  Turns.  Seems to look right at 
             Will.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       We put it back where we found it.

             Will turns to them.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       You said it was a fishing cabin.

                                 FARRELL
                       Uh, right.  About two miles outside of
                       town.

                                 ELLIE
                       On the beach.

             Fred tightens his jaw.

                                 FRED
                       Why are we taking it back?

             Will ignores the question.  Walks back towards them.

                                 WILL
                       This murder was in the papers, right?

                                 ELLIE
                       Yeah.  All over.

                                 WILL
                       Call all of them from here to Anchorage.
                       Tell them we now know that Kay Connell
                       left the party with a dark blue knapsack,
                       but we haven't recovered it yet.
                           (checks watch)
                       We can get it in by the morning editions.

             He hands the bag to Farrell.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Fill this with random books.  Make it
                       look heavy.

             Will pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands.
             Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he
                       overlooked a detail.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             POV through BINOCULARS

             A WOODEN CABIN comes into focus.  Right by the water.  Hasn't
             been used in years.  Weathered, slate roof.  Algae growing up
             the sides.

                                 HAP (O.S.)
                       Nice.  Lighter than I remembered.

             WILL lowers his binoculars.  He's standing on the black rocky
             beach.  It's damp, slick, and cold.  A fog's rolling in.

             Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.  A
             couple paper bags and a megaphone.  They're comparing guns.

                                 FARRELL
                       Glock 40.  All plastic save the barrel
                       and firing pin.  Never rusts.  What do
                       you carry down in Seattle?

             Hap reaches into his holster.  Pulls out a...

                                 HAP
                       Smith and Wesson 45.

                                 FARRELL
                       Excellent!

             Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them.  He's got a
             pair of binoculars, too.  They're staking out the cabin.
             Been there a while.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Brought some coffee...

             Ellie appears with a thermos.  Crouching down.  Fred turns,
             annoyed.

                                 FRED
                       What are you doing here?

                                 WILL
                           (answering for her)
                       I told her to come.

             Fred shoots Will a look.  Down at his cowboy boots.  Will
             gives him a smile.

                                 ELLIE
                       Anything yet?

                                 WILL                    FRED
                       Nothing.                Nothing.

             Fred goes back to scanning, pissed.

                                 FARRELL
                       Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.

                                 HAP
                       Or goes straight to the Sports Section.

             Hap and Farrell chuckle.  Hap unscrews the thermos.  A cloud
             of steam.

                                 HAP (cont'd)
                       Who gets first dibs?
                           (looks up at Will)
                       Will?

             Will looks down at his partner.  Holding out the thermos like
             a weird kind of truce.  Will turns away, rejecting it.  A
             swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as...

             Fred tenses.

                                 FRED
                           (looking through binoculars)
                       I see someone!

             Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet.  Will whips up his
             binoculars.

             POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to 
             the cabin.  Furtive.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       That's him.

             Will lowers the binoculars.  Snaps his fingers at the men.
 
                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Fan out.

             Fred, Farrell and Hap.  Start spreading out.  Ellie steps
             up.  Will looks back at her.  Too dangerous.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Stay here, Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                       But...

             Will puts up his hand.  She stops short.  He plunges ahead.

             Hap.  Will.  Farrell.  Fred.  Fanning out.  Silent.  Keeping
             eye-contact.  Will points to Farrell.  Wants the megaphone.
             Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.  Accidentally
             keys it.  The feedback SQUAWKS.  Fuck.

                                 FRED
                       He's bolting!

             POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around,
             running towards the cabin.  Leaping from rock to rock.

             WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson.

                                 WILL
                       Go!  Go!  Go!

             The men jump into action.  Race down towards the cabin.

             Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.  Will and Hap,
             harder going.  Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small
             crevices.  Rocks sticking out every which way.  The fog,
             thick and white...

             THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin.

             FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down.
             Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...

             WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him.  Joins Fred
             and Farrell at the door.

             Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod
             to Fred as he KICKS it in...

             INT. FISHING CABIN - CONTINUOUS

             ...the door CRACKS and swings in.  The men rush inside.

                                WILL
                       Police!

             They look around:  Nothing.  A few old nets, a wooden table
             rotted through.  No knapsack.

             In the corner, a TRAP DOOR, left open.  Will races over.
             Looks down into the darkness.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Goddammit!

             Turns and points to Farrell.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       You!  Head back up to base...
                           (to Fred)
                       You!  Go right and follow along the
                       water...
                           (to Hap)
                       Hap!  You go left...

             The men nod.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Go!

             They rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches
             down by the trap door and...

             INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

             ...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL.  Water dripping.
             FOOTFALLS echoing.  Will cocks his head.  Left or right?
             Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel,
             his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls.  He
             rounds a curve.  Sound recedes...

             EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

             ...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.  Stops short.

             FOG

             has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all
             sound.  Like a strange dream.  Eerie.

             Will blinks against the thick whiteness.  Strains to hear any
             sound, anything.  There's only the distant LAPPING of the
             water.

             He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog.
             Quick, careful steps.  Stumbles over a rock.  Waves his gun
             in defense.  Eyes wide open like a blind man...

             SUDDENLY

             a GUNSHOT.  Off to the right.  Will whips his head around.

             EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
 
             Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound.  Reaches for her weapon...

             EXT. DOWN THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

             Will heads towards the sound.  Reaching out for approaching
             rocks.  Scrambles over a small bank and finds...

             FARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground. 
             Clutching his thigh.  Blood seeping through his fingers.  He
             looks up.

                                 FARRELL
                       Sorry about...

                                 WILL
                       Where is he?

             Farrell can't answer that.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                           (impatient)
                       Where'd the shot come from?

             Farrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water.

                                 FARRELL
                       Over there.

             Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind.

             Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few 
             seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood 
             pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a
             plateau of rocks when...

             SUDDENLY

             a DARK FIGURE

             flashes past him.  The killer!  Inches away.  Will wheels
             around...

                                 WILL
                       Freeze!

             CRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it.
             Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure,
             disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches
             behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13...

             EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
 
             Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.  A HAND
             suddenly grabs her arm.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Dammit, Ellie!...

             Fred emerges from the fog.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Put that thing away!  Farrell's down!...

             CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie
             freeze.

             EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

             Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks.  Getting closer to
             the water.  Hear a voice ring out...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Hap!

             The fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see...

             WILL DORMER

             kneeling beside the body of his partner.  Lying in the water.
             Shot in the stomach.  Blood dribbling from his mouth.  Will
             grabs him up by the collar.

                                 WILL
                       Hap!

             Starts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Hap!

             Hap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white...

             Will, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound...
             trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the
             water...

             Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body.
             Feels for Hap's pulse.

                                 FRED
                       Dormer...

             Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins
             popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Dormer!  He's gone.

             Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts.

             Suddenly leaps to his feet.  Grabs a rock and hurls it
             savagely into the thick fog.

             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

             Chief Nyback sits in his chair.  Fingers interlaced.  A 
             somber expression on his face.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       And then you lost him.

             Will sits opposite him.  Wet, dishevelled, dirty.  Hap's
             blood smeared all over his shirt.  Staring off into space.

                                 WILL
                       And then I lost him.  In the fog.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       About how long 'til you heard the
                       suspect's second shot?

             Will, hesitates.

                                 WILL
                       Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the
                       sound down to the water.  That's where...

             He blinks.  Looks down.  Swallows.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       That's where I found Hap.

             Nyback sighs, shakes his head.  Reaches down to his bottom
             drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       I think you need a glass of this.

             He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head.
             Stands.  Paces.  Rakes his hand through his hair.

             Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk.
             Everything CRASHES to the floor.

                                 WILL
                           (yells)
                       Why didn't I know about that goddamn
                       tunnel, Charlie?

             Nyback looks up at him.  Calm.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       There's a bunch of those tunnels out
                       there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty
                       years old.  I don't even know half of
                       them myself, and I grew up here.

             Will clenches his fists.

                                 WILL
                       I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of
                       me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son-
                       of-a-bitch.  Playing with me.  And I
                       missed the shot.  He was right there and
                       I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun
                       jammed...

             Nyback gets up.  Limps over to his old friend.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Will, you can't blame yourself.

                                 WILL
                       I had him!

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       It's only gonna make you crazy.

             Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door.  The men look
             over.  Ellie sticks her head in.  Speaks in a tone that
             belies that a man has recently died.

                                 ELLIE
                       You wanted to see me?

             Will turns his back to her.  Nyback heads over.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Right, Ellie.

             Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  At Will's
             back.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       I want you to take care of the
                       investigation into Detective Eckhart's
                       shooting.

             Ellie looks at him.  Confused.  Lowers her voice.

                                 ELLIE
                       But what about the Connell case?  I'm on
                       the Connell case.

             Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that.
                       Just write up a quick report.

             Ellie's shoulders droop.  Thought she was playing with the
             big boys.  Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.

                                 WILL
                       I'm going to check on the roadblocks...

             Nyback catches his arm.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       You're no good right now, Will.  Go back
                       to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest.

             Will looks at him.  Know's he's right.

             EXT. ROAD - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a SQUEALING tire, ripping around a curve...

             INT./EXT. SILVER JEEP CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Will driving.  Speeding.  Scenery whipping past the window.
             His hands, tight around the steering wheel.  The hula-girl,
             dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to
             her face.

             He grows suddenly pale.  Pulls the Cherokee off to the side.

             EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

             Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open.  Runs
             down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.

             INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

             A couple industrial trash bins.  Will leans his hand against
             the wall and vomits.  Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping
             from his mouth.  Braces himself.  Heaves again.  Hears a 
             BUZZING behind him.  Turns.

             A DEAD DOG lying next to a dumpster.  FLIES buzzing around
             its head.  Teeth bared.  Eyes wide open.

             Like it's watching him.

             INT. PIONEER LODGE - LATER

             Will walks up to reception.  No one there.  Just wants his
             key.  Rings the bell.  In the back room, he hears a RADIO.

                                 RADIO
                       ...earlier this evening after an aborted
                       attempt to apprehend a suspect.  He was
                       forty-five...

             It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway.
             Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.

                                 RACHEL
                       I'm sorry about your partner.

             Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       It's been on the radio for the last two
                       hours.  Nothing but that.  Like when they
                       found Kay Connell's body.
                           (sympathetic smile)
                       We're not used to this sort of thing up
                       here.

             She reaches for his key.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       He was standing right there just a couple
                       of days ago.  Your partner.  Exactly
                       where you are now.
                           (beat)
                       I hope I was nice to him.

             Will takes his key.

                                 WILL
                       You were nice to him.  He liked you.

             He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS.

                                 RACHEL
                           (answering)
                       Pioneer Lodge?...
                           (listens)
                       Hold on a second.  He's right here.

             Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the
             mouthpiece.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       John Warfield.  He's called a couple of
                       times.

             Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the 
             world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       Want me to lie?

             Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone.
             Clears his throat.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Dormer.

             PAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end.

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE
                       Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to
                       reach you.  I was very sorry to hear
                       about your partner, Detective Eckhart.
                       It must have been a terrible shock, what
                       happened this morning.

             Will.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not
             to listen.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       That's not exactly how I'd put it.

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       No, no.  I suppose not.  But I look
                       forward to reading the report.  Very
                       sad.  Very sad.  Funny...

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       What do you mean, "Funny?"

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE
                       Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective
                       Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting
                       to make a real connection before you
                       left.  I sensed that he was ready to get
                       some things off his chest.  Did you
                       sense anything like that, Detective?  I
                       mean, as his partner?...

             Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.

                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...You were his partner for, what, about
                       ten years?...

             Will turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       You know why everyone hates you,
                       Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's
                       not your press conferences, it's not even
                       your cheap suits; everyone hates you
                       'cause day after day you suck the marrow
                       out of real cops when you never had the
                       balls to become one yourself.  Well I got
                       to tell you, it's a shame you're not up
                       here with me because I'd love to show you
                       right now just what a real cop is capable
                       of.  You just remember that when you're
                       sitting at your bullshit desk reading
                       your bullshit report on my dead partner!

             SLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his
             hair.  Turns back to Rachel.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Next time.  Go ahead and lie.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             Fog everywhere.  Dense.  White.  Suffocating.

             We're running through it.  Clambering over rocks.  Hearing
             the sound of our own BREATHING.  Our own HEARTBEAT.
             Adrenaline pumping.  An animal tracking its prey...

             SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE

             flashes past.  Just inches away.  Playing with us.  Taunting
             us.  We whip round with our weapon and...

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

             BANG!  Will bolts upright in bed.  A film of sweat over his
             body.  Breathing hard.  The sound that woke him: the window
             shade FLAPPING open.  LIGHT floods the room.

             Will gets up.  Goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  It
             lurches up halfway.  He tugs it down again.  It slaps all the
             way open.  Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.

                                 WILL
                       Goddammit!

             He gets tangled in it.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Goddamned...thing!

             Pulls it off and flings it in the corner.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M.

             The digital clock flips to a new minute:  4:23.  Will,
             pacing.  Scratching at his stubble.  Unable to sleep.  Keeps
             stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard.

             Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room.
             Hovers.  Lightly pushes the door open.  Sees...

             THE PICTURES on the bedside table.  A WOMAN and three teenage
             GIRLS.  Hap's family.

             INT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M.

             Water gushing out of the faucet.  Will's WATCH sitting on the
             sink's edge.  5:18.

             Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle
             of aspirin.  Shakes out a couple.  Cups his hand under the
             water and knocks the pills back.

             Closes the medicine cabinet and CRIES out...

             HAP'S REFLECTION

             looming behind him.

                                 HAP
                       They're watching us, Will...

             Will whirls around...

                                 WILL
                       Hap!

             ...nothing.  No one's there.

             EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             CLOSE ON running shoes, POUNDING the tarmac.  PULL BACK to
             reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street.  Eyes
             bloodshot.

             A COUPLE NATIVE ALASKANS walking into a hardware store.  Stop
             talking and glance over at him.

             A YOUNG MOTHER in her husband's work shirt.  Lifts her small
             KIDS into the cab of a 4x4.  Watches him pass.

             AN OLDER MAN fixing the broken "E" on his store front.  Turns
             at the sound of Will's footfall.

             Everyone edgy.  Cautious.  A murderer amongst them.

             Will continues on.  Looking straight ahead.  Wipes the sweat
             from his neck.  Slows to a stop just outside the...

             LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE

             A blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window.  Below, a
             painted sign:  We miss you, Kay.

             A stack of newspapers by the front door.  The "Nightmute
             Ledger."  The headline:  Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect.

             Will picks one up.  Stares down at it.  Rain starts to dot
             the paper.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
                       ...We're going to bring down a couple of
                       guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to
                       step up the investigation here...

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

             Rain hammering against the windows.  Chief Nyback addresses
             the bullpen.  Everyone's there except Farrell.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       ...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in
                       thirty-seven years, and even though
                       Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he
                       was as good as one of us on this case.  I
                       had the honor of working with him down in
                       Seattle for a number of years.  He was a
                       fine detective and an even better man.

             Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  His
             suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  Nyback nods towards Fred.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Fred, you'll be working with Detective
                       Dormer directly from now on.

             Fred, stroking his moustache, nods.  Nyback turns to Will.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       Will?  Anything you'd like to add?

             Will looks up.  Everyone's eyes turn to him.  He shakes his
             head.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Okay.  Then let's get to it.

             Feet shuffling.  Chairs scraping the floor as people get up.
             A sense of determination in the air.  Will grabs his coat.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer?

             He turns.  Ellie is beside him, holding a map.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I'm sorry to bother you, but I was asked
                       to write the report on...
                           (lowers eyes)
                       ...you know what I was asked to write the
                       report on...
                           (looks back up)
                       ...Could you, just to be accurate, for
                       the report, could you just point out
                       where you were when you saw Detective
                       Eckhart yesterday?

             She holds out the map.  It's of the small stretch of
             coastline.  Red circles marking various points.

             Will looks down at her.  Takes the map.  Turns it around.

                                 WILL
                       It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're
                       doing your job.

             He looks down at the map.  Ellie watching his face.

                                 ELLIE
                       I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know
                       you did everything you could...

             Will points to a spot.  Cutting her off.

                                 WILL
                       I was here.

             Hands her back the map.  Smiles.  Just then Fred walks up.

                                 FRED
                       Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that
                       went through Farrell.

                                 WILL
                       I'm going to the hospital to talk to him
                       now.
                           (looks at his watch)
                       You get the search party together.  No
                       fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you
                       in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't
                       waste any time.

             He pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  Fred watches
             him leave.  Sticks a toothpick in his mouth.

                                 FRED
                       Partner or no partner.  That guy's a
                       prick.

                                 ELLIE
                       He has to be a prick, Fred.  He's a great
                       detective.

             INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL - DAY

             CLOSE ON the cover of one of the paperbacks, Otherwise
             Engaged by Walter Byrd.

             PULL BACK to reveal Farrell lying in a hospital bed in
             striped pajamas, reading it.  A tear runs down his cheek as
             he turns the page.

             A SNICKERS BAR is tossed onto his lap.  He looks up.  Face
             brightens.

                                 FARRELL
                       Detective Dormer!

            Will stands by his bed.  Farrell puts down the book.  Picks
            up the Snickers.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       You don't seem like the bring-an-
                       underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a-
                       Snickers-bar kind of guy.

                                 WILL
                       I'm not.

             He pulls up a chair.  Nods to the paperback.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       How's the book?

             Farrell bites into the candy bar.

                                 FARRELL
                       Oh, a real tear-jerker.  Brody, the good
                       guy, just got shot.

             He stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows
             uncomfortably.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       Oh.  I'm sorry.  About Hap.  Detective
                       Eckhart.

                                 WILL
                       Thanks.

                                 FARRELL
                       I wish I'd had the chance to get to know
                       him better.  Take him fishing or
                       something.

                                 WILL
                       He would have liked that.

                                 FARRELL
                       We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

                                 WILL
                       That's why I'm here.  I need to know
                       exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.

                                 FARRELL
                       What I saw?

                                 WILL
                       Anything.  It's important.

             Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little
             boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember.

                                 FARRELL
                       Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so
                       thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of
                       nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing 
                       any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only
                       when you came up close.  Then you
                       disappeared again.
                           (shrugs)
                       I guess I heard more than I saw.

             Will sighs, rubs his eyes.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       Sorry.

                                 WILL
                       No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your
                       fault.

             Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty,
             freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell.

                                 NURSE
                       Time for your meds.

             Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will.

                                 FARRELL
                       Lonnie and I went to high school
                       together.

             Lonnie gives him the cup.

                                 LONNIE
                       Just take the pills, Farrell.

                                 WILL
                       How's the leg?

                                 FARRELL
                       Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much.
                       Bullet went right through.

                                 WILL
                       Right.  Got lost in the rocks.

                                 FARRELL
                       We'll get the other one, though.

             Will looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his
             mouth.

                                 FARRELL (cont'd)
                       After the autopsy.

             INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - LATER

             Will walks down the hallway.  Light pouring in from a set of
             high windows.  He looks tired.  Set-upon.

             POV of SOMEONE

             WATCHING HIM.  From a doorway.  Not close, not far.  A HAND
             comes into view.  Small.  Bruised knuckles.  Holds on to the
             door jamb.  Watches as...

             Will suddenly stops.  Skin prickling at the back of his neck.
             Turns and looks around.

             A MAN in a wheelchair.
 
             A LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown.

             A couple of NURSES laughing at check-in.

             An empty doorway.

             Nothing.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             Back at the beach.  We see nothing but fog.  A VOICE comes
             through.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       ...and it was at this point that Detective
                       Dormer headed towards the noise...

             Ellie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking
             into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks,
             wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big.

             A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to
             him.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Remember, Kepp, shoot everything...
                           (back to the tape recorder)
                       ...wherein he discovered the wounded
                       Detective Farrell Brooks, having been
                      shot in the vastus externus of the upper
                      left thigh...

             She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two
             evenings before.  Finds...

             ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Francis!

             He looks up.  Pimples on his chin.

                                 FRANCIS
                       What?

                                 ELLIE
                       You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in
                       the thigh and writhing in pain.

                                 FRANCIS
                       C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter?

                                 ELLIE
                       Accuracy.  That's what.
                           (points to the ground)
                       Now get down.

             Francis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets
             down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot.

                                 FRANCIS
                       Ow.

             CLICK!  Kepp takes the picture.

             EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

             Ellie sloshes through the water.  Ankles getting cold.
             Cheeks pink.  But it doesn't matter.  She's investigating.

                                 ELLIE
                           (into tape recorder)
                       ...shortly after hearing the second shot,
                       Detective Dormer continued through the
                       water until he spotted the body, lying
                       approximately fifteen feet away.

             She stops.  Looks at the map.  At the spot Will pointed out.
     	     Looks back up.  Fog.  Clicks off the recorder.  Calls out.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       You there, Rich?

             A VOICE calls back.  Someone pretending to be Hap.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Yeah.  And I'm freezing my nads off!

             Ellie furrows her brow.  Just then...

             FRANCIS appears.  Slips on a rock but catches his fall.

                                 FRANCIS
                       Ellie!  Think I found something!

             EXT. ROAD NEAR BEACH - DAY

             CLOSE ON a row of FEET.  Mostly boots.  Some more beat-up
             than others.  Inching forward along a road.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       ...Anything catches your eye, you put it
                       in a bag.  Anything looks strange, you
                       put it in a bag...

             PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out
             across the road about a mile up the beach.  Some old, some
             young.  Linking arms and moving forward.  Looking down.  The
             SEARCH PARTY.

             Will, walking up and down behind the line.  Talking through a
             megaphone.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       ...Anything he may have dropped, moved,
                       kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag.
                       Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper
                       clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of
                       ten a suspect leaves something behind...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Detective?

             Will turns.  A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS.

                                 BURLY GUY #1
                       Where do you want us?

             Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.

                                 WILL
                       The woods.  One group heading south, the
                       other heading north.

             Nods to Fred who's standing nearby.  He hands the guys two
             radios.
 
                                 FRED
                       Make sure they're set to channel 6...

             Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car.  Young
             and apple-cheeked.  The first one holding a piece of paper.

                                 OFFICER #1
                       We did the interviews with all the nearby
                       houses like you asked.

                                 WILL 
                       Anything?

                                 OFFICER #1
                           (shakes his head)
                       Here's a list of who we talked to.

             Hands the list to Will.  He glances it.

                                 WILL
                       Alright.  Go back and set up some follow-
                       ups for this afternoon.

             The Officers nod, put the car in reverse.  Fred saunters
             over.  Nods towards the searchers.

                                 FRED
                       You don't think they should start further
                       back?

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       He had to have exited here.  Over those
                       boulders.  I saw him move, he's nimble.
                       Would have taken the hardest way out.

             Fred shrugs, skeptical.  Just then, his cell phone BLEATS.
             He reaches for it.

                                 FRED
                           (into phone)
                       Duggar...

             Will looks back at the search team.  Slow.  Meticulous.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                           (into phone)
                       Where was it?

             A local WOMAN.  At the end of the line.  Glances over her
             shoulder.  Looks at Will.  Smiles.  You'll help us catch him.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                           (into phone)
                       Okay. 
                           (slaps phone closed)
                       That was Ellie.

             Will turns back to him.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       They found Farrell's bullet.  Says it
                       looks like a 357.  After the autopsy Rich
                       can drive 'em both to the lab in
                       Anchorage.  Have a murder weapon by
                       morning.

             Fred crosses his arms.  Sarcastic.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       That is, if it's alright with you.

             EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             Thunder RUMBLING.

             INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             Rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key.  Looks
             about a hundred years old.

             Will enters the lobby.  Soaked through.  Carrying an armload
             of wet files.  Rachel turns, sees him.  Reaches over to an
             umbrella stand.  Hands him an umbrella.

                                 RACHEL
                       Here.  It's on the house.

             Will takes it.  Preoccupied.

                                 WILL
                       Thanks.

             He starts up the stairs.  Notices Rachel straining to return
             the key to the top of the clock.  Backtracks to help her.
             She gets it without his help.

                                 RACHEL
                       I got it.
                           (smiles)
                       Don't know why I bother.  It's been
                       broken for two years.

                                 WILL
                       Habit.

             Rachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers
             something.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       Oh.  A man came by to see you earlier.
                       Said he was your new partner.

             A TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her.

                                 WILL
                       Fred Duggar?

                                 RACHEL
                       No.  He didn't say what his name was.
                       Only that you were expecting him.

                                 WILL
                       I'm not expecting anyone.

                                 RACHEL
                       That's not what he thinks.

                                 WILL
                       What did he look like?

             Rachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock.

                                 RACHEL
                       Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable.

             Will nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding
             headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates.

                                 WILL
                       I need to borrow something.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

             CLOSE ON a nail.  One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into
             the wall.  PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a
             blanket to one side of the window.  An ad hoc curtain.

             He finishes that side.  Starts to stretch the blanket across
             the window.  Hesitates.  Looks outside.  To the left.  To the
             right.  To see if anybody's out there.  If anybody's
             watching.  Sees instead...

             A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor.  Pulling a huge
             freighter.  Will squeezes his eyes shut.  Opens them again.
             Pulls the blanket fully across the window.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M.

             The FILES spread across the floor.  Their edges buckled from
             the rain.  Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell.  School
             records.  Private letters.  Health files.  Coroner's report.

             Will.  Pacing.  Back and forth.  Thinking.  Over that same
             SQUEAKY floorboard.  The clock reads: 1:05.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M.

             Will lying in bed.  On top of the blanket.  Wide awake.
             Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR.  Into Hap's room.

             EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT

             Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of
             the Pioneer Lodge.  Jams his hands in his pockets.  The walk
             of an insomniac.

             EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT

             Will walking down main street.  In the middle of the road.
             The dead of night.  No cars.  The sky a blinding white.

             Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights
             flickering.  A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle.  Birds SINGING.
 
             Not day.  Not night.  Stuck somewhere in between.  Like a
             dream.

             Turns down a side street.  Passing more stores.  Guns and
             Ammo.  Patty's Hair and Nails.  General Store.  Comes upon
     
             THE ALLEY

             where he vomited the day before.  Stops.  Sees the DEAD DOG,
             still down at the end.  Half obscured by the dumpster.

             Will wavers, pale.  Suddenly...

             A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows.  Big.  Wild-eyed.
             Awakened from his sleep.  Will, quickly backtracks to the
             sidewalk.  Spooked.

             JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball.  He turns.  In the 
             distance.  Nightmute Elementary School.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT

             A Little League game in full swing.  The uniforms, a little
             faded.  The diamond, a little unkempt.  A smattering of
             SPECTATORS.  Mostly dads with six-packs.

             Will wanders over to the fence.  Spots Ellie sitting alone on
             the bottom bleacher.

                                                                   CUT TO:

             POV OF SOMEONE

             WATCHING HIM.  From afar.  The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a
             few seconds.  Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers...

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

             ...and sits down next to Ellie.  She turns, surprised.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Detective Dormer!  What are you doing
                       here?
                           (looks at watch)
                       It's two-thirty in the morning.
                       Shouldn't you be asleep?

             Will glances out at the game.

                                 WILL
                       I could say the same thing about you.

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh.  We always have play-offs in the
                       middle of the night.  It's the best time.

                                 WILL
                       Who's playing?

                                 ELLIE
                       The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in
                       extra innings.  The Hawks have a really
                       good line-up this year.

             She sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A
             plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble.

                                 ELLIE
                       That's my sister.

             Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss
             by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                           (calling out)
                       That's okay, Lib!
                           (to Will)
                       Usually she's better.

                                 WILL
                       She your only sibling?

                                 ELLIE
                           (nods)
                       Twelve years younger.

             Libby takes another swing.  Connects with the ball.  Drops
             the bat and runs to first.  Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       What about you?  You have any siblings?

                                 WILL
                       No.
                           (rubs his eyes)
                       Well.  I had a brother.  He died when I
                       was eleven.

             Ellie, sits up...

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh, I shouldn't have...

                                 WILL
                       It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He
                       was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.

                                 ELLIE
                       That must have been awful for you.

             Will leans back.  Stretching his legs.  Remembering.

                                 WILL
                       Not really. 
                           (slight smile)
                       I remember I was more embarrassed that he
                       had died.  Embarrassed that it made me
                       different.  So I didn't tell the other kids
                       at school what had happened.  They'd ask 
                       me where he was, where he'd gone.  And I'd
                       make up stories.  He was visiting an aunt up
                       north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a 
                       Swiss boarding school.  Stuff like that.
                           (shakes his head)
                       Nice kid, huh?  Just kept making up more
                       and more lies...

             Suddenly, he stops talking.  Slowly sits up.  Sensing 
             something.  Ellie, noticing the shift.

                                 ELLIE
                       You okay?

             The row of DADS behind them.  Jump up and start CHEERING.

                                                                   CUT TO:

             POV OF THE PERSON

             WATCHING WILL.  Sees him sit up.  Look around.  That same
             prickle at the back of his neck.  A KID slides home just as...

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

             ...Will stands.  Trying to shake the feeling.

                                 WILL
                       I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie.
                       Still need to go through some of Kay
                       Connell's school records.

                                 ELLIE
                           (unsure)
                       Okay.

             He turns to go, scanning the area.  Ellie calls after him.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Try to get some sleep!

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - EARLY MORNING

             The Nightmute morgue.  Next morning.  A SQUAD CAR pulls up.
             Francis gets out, whistling.  Starts for the morgue's
             entrance.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EARLY MORNING

             Will in the Cherokee.  Dark circles under his eyes.  Suit
             jacket wrinkled.  Pulls in next to Francis' squad car.

                                 WILL
                           (calls out window)
                       Officer!...

             Francis turns.

                                 WILL 
                       I'll pick it up.  You head back to the
                       station.

             INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - EARLY MORNING

             Will walking down a hallway.  Fluorescent lights.
             Cinderblock walls.  On his cell phone.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Duggar - I'm at the coroner's now.  I'll
                       be back in about twenty minutes...

             Stops at an open doorway in time to see
    
             THE CORONER pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of Hap
             Eckhart.

             Will's heart lurches.  He grabs on to the door jamb.  Wasn't
             ready for that.  The coroner looks up.

                                 CORONER
                       Detective.  Thought you were sending one
                       of your lackeys.

             Will clears his throat.  Closes his cell phone.

                                 WILL
                       I thought it was better if I came.  Under
                       the circumstances.

             The coroner nods.  Goes to wash her hands.

                                 CORONER
                       It's different when you know them, isn't
                       it?
                           (nods to clipboard)
                       Just sign over there and she's all yours.

             Shrugs off her lab coat.  She's wearing a blue dress.  Looks
             like a piano teacher.  Heads into an adjoining office.

             Will.  Alone.  Steps into the room.  The smell of
             formaldehyde.  Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray.
             Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape
             under the sheet when...

             SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down.  Thick fingers.  Wedding
             band.

             Will jumps...

                                 CORONER (O.S.)
                       Your partner didn't suffer much...

             The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila
             envelope.  Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       Maybe for a minute or two.

             Will rubs his face.  Tries to focus on the clipboard.  The
             coroner holds out the envelope.  Smiles.

                                 CORONER (cont'd)
                       Just enough time to reflect.

                                 WILL
                       Thanks, Doc.

             He takes the envelope.  The coroner peers up at him.

                                 CORONER
                       You're looking a little green, Detective.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             Fred Duggar, dialing the phone at his cluttered desk.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       So where's the other bullets?

             He looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila
             envelope.

             INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             CLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock.  Opens with a CLICK!

             PULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room.
             Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER.  The evidence
             locker.  Room's stuffed with old files and boxes.  MOOSE
             ANTLERS hanging over a small window.  Will glances up.

                                 WILL
                       What's with all the moose antlers around
                       here?

             Fred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker.

                                 FRED
                       Lots of moose.

             INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on
             this one: Farrell Brooks.

             Fred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to
             give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom
             corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow.

                                 WILL
                       When's Rich coming?

             Fred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door.

                                 FRED
                       I'll call him now.

                                 WILL
                       First I need a copy of the key.

             Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.

                                 FRED
                       This isn't Seattle, Detective.  We don't
                       have copies.
                           (holds up key)
                       This is the only one.

             Will looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand.
             Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway.

                                 SECRETARY
                       Detective Dormer?  Telephone.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             The secretary hands Will the phone.  Pulls something from
             under the desk.  A beat-up BOX.  Will's name on it.

                                 SECRETARY
                       This came for you earlier.

             Will glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Dormer.

             Nothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything.
             Will, too tired for this shit...

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna
                       check up on me every...

             Then...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's.
             This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       I bet you haven't been getting much
                       sleep.

             Will straightens.  Something weird.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       What?

             A little TITTER on the other end.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       You lower-48s.  You think the white
                       nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't
                       sleep for days.  I've seen it happen
                       about a million times.  But you can't
                       sleep for a different reason.

                                 WILL
                           (into phone)
                       Who is this?

             A PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie.

                                 WILL 
                           (into phone)
                       I said, who is this?

             The voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       I saw what really happened, Will...

             Will, furrows his brow.

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       I saw you kill your partner.  With your
                       back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach.
                       I saw you shoot him dead...

             CLOSE ON

             Will Dormer's face.

             As all the blood drains from it.

             As all SOUND

             fades around him.

             As his heart
 
             begins to POUND against his chest.

             He falters, reaching out for the desk.  To steady himself.
             As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him.  Eyes,
             darting around the bullpen...

                                 WILL
                           (sotto, into phone)
                       Now you listen to me...

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                       Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh,
                       and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's
                       old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks.
                       But you can go ahead and keep that.

             CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...I mean...
                           (beat)
                       ...Now that we're partners.

             CLICK.  The line goes dead.

             Will, throat constricted.  Listening to the DIAL TONE.
             Smiles back at Nyback.  Turns.  Slowly hangs up the phone.
             White as a sheet.  Trying to act normal.  Trying to act calm.
             SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different.
             Looks over at

             THE BOX

             sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk.  He reaches for
             it.  Carefully, rips the packing tape.  Bends back a flap.
             Inside, some dark blue material.  An embroidered daisy.
  
             Kay Connell's knapsack.

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             Will, heading for the Cherokee.  Clutching the box.  Face
             pale, pace quick.  Everything's different now.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer!

             He closes his eyes.  Now is not the time.  Reaches the
             Cherokee.  Yanks open the driver's side door.  Ellie catches
             up with him.  Out of breath.

                                 ELLIE
                       You look like you're in a hurry.  I just
                       wanted to ask you about these pictures.

             She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS.  They're of the BEACH.
             The ones Kepp took.  Almost all fog.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I know they're not great quality, but
                       this is where you said you were when you
                       first saw Detective Eckhart, right?

             Will.  Barely glancing at them.  Tosses the box into the car.

                                 WILL
                       Right.

             Gets in and closes the door.  Puts his hand over the box.
             Ellie comes up to the window.

                                 ELLIE
                       But here's the thing.  I retraced your
                       exact steps according to your statement.
                       You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart
                       from there.  I mean, not in that fog.

                                 WILL
                       Then change it.

                                 ELLIE
                       How much closer would you say you were?

                                 WILL
                       I don't remember.

                                 ELLIE
                       Five feet?  Seven feet?

             Will, about to seriously lose his shit.  Looks at Ellie.
             Eyes dark, distant.

                                 WILL
                       Listen, Ellie.  I don't have time for
                       this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty
                       feet.  Put down whatever you want in your
                       report, alright?

             He turns the ignition.  Pulls out with a SQUEAL.  Ellie
             steps back, watching him drive away.  More curious than
             stung.

             EXT. OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             The Cherokee.  Parked off-road.  A remote spot by the water.
             The driver's side door, left open.  The PING-PING-PING of the
             interior BELL.

             EXT. BREAKFRONT - DAY

             Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront.  Aimless.  One foot
             in front of the other.  Staring out at nothing.  The endless
             sea.  Waves CRASHING.  Wind HOWLING.  Seagulls SCREECHING.

             Everything.  Closing in on him...

             He stumbles over a rock.  Grabs his head in his hands.

             Stunned.  Guilty.  Ashamed.  Fucked.

             He saw it.  He saw it!

             A WAVE, explodes nearby.  Drenching him in sea spray.

             Will turns, raking his hand across his face.  Blinking.  Eyes
             stinging.  Trying to focus.  Trying to think this through...

             Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.

             Shakes his head.  Looks at his watch.

             Got to deal with the problem at hand.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - DAY

             Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge.  The shoulders of
             his coat still wet with sea spray.  Crosses to the area of
             the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out.

             Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot.
             Testing.  Testing.  Until...he finds the one that SQUEAKS.

             Gets down on his knees.  Hesitates.  Then jams his fingers in
             around the loose board.  Starts pulling it up.  Face
             reddening.  Knuckles whitening.  Slips his hand into the gap.

             Pulls out a muddy 357 RUGER.

             The killer's gun.

             Will, stares down at it.

             INT. ALLEY - DAY

             Will, standing at the mouth of the ALLEY.  Just like the
             night before.  Steps inside.  Cautious.  Eyes darting.
             Peering into the shadows for the HOMELESS MAN...

             Not there.  Coast's clear.  Heads for the dumpster at the end 
             of the alley.  Shoves it aside.  Looks down at...

             The DEAD DOG.  Rancid.  Rotting.  Will gags.  Holds a
             handkerchief to his face.  Waving away the flies.

             Then.  Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket.  Shrugs his coat
             off and wraps it around his hand and the gun.  Looks away.
             Fires a muffled SHOT into the dog's side.  The body kicks.

             Crouches down.  Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's
             point of entry.  Finds it.  Pulls out a PENKNIFE and extends
             one of the blades.  Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep
             for the lodged bullet.  He finds it.  Pulls it out.

             Looks back at the dog.  Takes a deep breath.  Wipes his brow.
             A little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead.
             Turns and pulls a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL from his pocket. 
             Douses the bullet.  Cleaning it.  Glancing at his watch.
             Running out of time...

             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

             The rear of the Nightmute PD building.  Will, looking around,
             heads briskly for the back door...

             INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             ...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen.  Hears 
             VOICES.  Nearby.  Ducks back.  Waiting for them to fade.

             Safe.  Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM.  Glancing briefly
             at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.  Of old time POLICE
             OFFICERS.  Striking brave poses...

             INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             The storage room.  Hot.  Stifling.  The moose antlers LOOMING
             over his shoulder.  Will pulls the evidence locker key from 
             his pocket.  Unlocks the padlock.  Swings the door open.

             Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out.  Throwing a look over his
             shoulder.  Opens it.  Shakes out the bullet that was lodged
             in Hap's spine.  Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket.
             The bullet he shot into the dead dog.  Drops that into the
             envelope and reseals it.  Hands shaking.

             Something.  Catches the corner of his eye.  He turns.

             HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror.  The blood smear still
             on his forehead.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       Dormer...

             Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred 
             Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears
             his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then
             Farrell's.  Angry.

                                 WILL
                       These should have gone out two hours ago.

             SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich
             exchange a glance.

             EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a YOUNG GIRL's face.  Dark hair held up in two
             barrettes, wind tousling the curls.  Reading from a piece of
             paper. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                       ...And that's how I think Kay would want
                       us to remember her...

             PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing
             by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a
             brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
                       ...Swimming, reading, hiking through the
                       Kebaughs...

             FRED, ELLIE AND WILL

             stand off to the side.  Dressed in black.  Fred looks like
             he's never worn a tie before.  Ellie holds a potted plant.  A
             gift for the bereaved.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
                       ...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's
                       after school...

             Will.  Eyes bloodshot.  Not really listening.  Not really
             paying attention.  A thousand miles away.  Tugs at his
             collar.  Feels tight.

                                 YOUNG GIRL 
                       ...And always, always with a smile on her
                       face.

             The young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People
             SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm.

             Some CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets.
             Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                       Want one?

             Will, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him.
             Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his
             head.  Looks back up at

             THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's
             casket.

             AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like
             sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red
             beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with
             a pink ribbon...

             Will, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something
             catches his eye.

             RANDY STETZ

             in tight jeans and a down vest.  In front of him stands a 
             GIRL with white-blonde hair.

             From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room.

             Will, straightens at the sight of her.

             Sees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass.

             EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

             The service is over.  People are heading back to their cars.
             Fred yanks off his tie.  Looks at Ellie.

                                 FRED
                       We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell.

             He starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will.

                                 WILL
                       You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second.

             Ellie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention
             back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the 
             cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle.

             EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - MINUTES LATER

             Randy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on.  The girl's
             about to get on behind him.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                       Why don't I give her a ride?

             They look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind
             whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face.

                                 RANDY
                       Thought I smelled something.

                                 WILL
                       Good to see you, too, Randy.

             Will arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at
             him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost
             translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation
             stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket.

                                 TANYA
                       Who're you?

             EXT. GRAVESITE - CONTINUOUS

             Fred shakes Mrs. Connell's hand.  Ellie waits.  Looks over
             and sees
 
             WILL standing with Tanya and Randy.

             Shifts the plant in her hands.

             EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

             Will shows the gold shield on his belt.

                                 RANDY
                       Fuckin' cop.

             Randy kick starts the bike.  It dies.  He kicks it again.
             Calls out over his shoulder.

                                 RANDY
                       You coming or not?

             INT. CHEROKEE - FOREST - DAY

             Sunlight dappling through tall fir trees.  Will drives.
             Tanya sitting next to him.  Her black skirt riding up.
             Picking at the flaking polish on her nails.
 
                                 TANYA
                       I never met anyone from Seattle before.

                                 WILL
                       You're not missing much.

                                 TANYA
                       What are you doing in this shit-hole
                       town?

             Will, shifts.  Looks over.

                                 WILL
                       You were good friends with Kay Connell,
                       weren't you?

             Tanya hesitates.  Pulls a cigarette from her purse.

                                 TANYA
                       I was her best friend.

                                 WILL
                       Best friend?

                                 TANYA
                       Since grade school.

                                 WILL
                       That's a long time.

                                 TANYA
                       We were like sisters.  Knew everything
                       about each other.

                                 WILL
                       Must be tough for you.  What happened.

             Tanya shrugs.  Lights the cigarette.  Takes a drag.

                                 TANYA
                       Everybody says I'm holding up great,
                       considering.  Don't even care if I go to
                       school.  They're all worried I haven't
                       cried yet.

             She stretches.  Her midriff showing.  Shifts her body towards
             Will.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       But there's no law against not crying,
                       right?

                                 WILL
                       What about Kay's other friends?

             Tanya makes a face.  Reaches out and taps the hula-girl.

                                 TANYA
                       Do we have to talk about Kay?  I don't
                       want to talk about her right now.  Let's
                       just drive.  Go somewhere.

             Will looks over at her.  She blows out a plume of smoke.
             Smiles.  Seductive.

                                 WILL
                       You want me to take you somewhere?

                                 TANYA
                       Long as it's fun.

             She reaches out a sinewy arm.  Starts massaging the back of
             Will's neck.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       Young, impressionable girl left alone
                       with older, Seattle detective.  Who knows
                       what we could get up to.

             Will, impervious to the touch.  Head, throbbing.  Reaches for
             the gear.  His foot, pressing harder on the gas.

             EXT. CHEROKEE - FOREST ROAD - CONTINUOUS

             SCREECH!  The Cherokee whips around a curve.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS
 
             Tanya giggles.  Likes the speed.  Will, goes even faster.

             EXT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS
 
             The Cherokee breaks free from the forest.  Racing along a
             coastal road.  Water CRASHING against the rocks.

             Up ahead, a LOGGING TRUCK coming the other way.  The Cherokee
             shifts lanes.  Heading straight for the truck.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Tanya looks out at the truck.  Still giggling.

                                 WILL
                       How about this.  You like this?

             The truck BEEPS.  Will goes faster.  Tanya takes her hand
             from Will's neck.  Holds on to her seat.

             EXT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             The gap's closing fast.  The truck BEEPS again.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Tanya looks over at Will.  Not giggling any more.

                                 TANYA
                       Hey...

                                 WILL
                       Thought you wanted something fun...

             Will goes even faster...

             EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD

             The truck and the Cherokee.  On a collision course.  The
             truck BEEPS wildly.

             INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

             Tanya squirming in her seat.  Not liking this any more.

                                 TANYA
                       Move over!

             Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK...
             bearing down on them...

             Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away...
             The TRUCK...a breath away...

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                           (screaming)
                       Move over, you crazy fuck!

             EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD

             The truck and the Cherokee...just feet from each other...at
             the last moment...the Cherokee jerks out of the way...

             EXT. ICICLE FISHING CANNERY - DAY

             ...SCREECHES to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery.
             Gravel flying.  Will gets out.  Slams his door.  Rounds the 
             car and opens Tanya's door.  She's screaming at him.

                                 TANYA
                       You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have
                       killed us!

             Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       Ow!  You're hurting me!

             Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates.
             Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       You want to tell me what the fuck this is
                       all about?

             Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone.

                                 WILL
                       You and Kay were like sisters?

                                 TANYA
                       That's what I said.

                                 WILL
                       Told each other everything.
                           (heads down the hill)
                       That why your picture's torn up in the
                       top drawer of her bureau?

             Tanya steps back.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on 
                       your ass at her funeral?

             He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will
             leans in.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       You like games, little girl?  Well how
                       about this one - you're standing right
                       where her naked body was found wrapped up
                       in a garbage bag.

             Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting,
             rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She
             tries to break away...

                                 TANYA
                       No...

                                 WILL
                       Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?

             Tanya looks away.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Who gave her those dresses?

             She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I need a name.

                                 TANYA
                       I don't know.

                                 WILL
                       You don't know.

                                 TANYA
                       She wouldn't tell me!

                                 WILL
                       But you were such good friends...

             Tanya, squirming.  Angry.

                                 TANYA
                       It was like some big fucking secret!

                                 WILL
                       What was?

                                 TANYA
                       She kept saying she was gonna get out of
                       here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was
                       going to take her!

                                 WILL
                       Who?

                                 TANYA
                       My arm!

                                 WILL
                       Who?

                                 TANYA
                       She used some stupid code name.

                                 WILL
                       What was it?

                                 TANYA
                       Brody...I don't know...
                           (crying)
                       ...Something Brody!

             Will straightens.  He's heard that name before.

             Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out.
             She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears
             streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground.

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                       You happy now, you fucking bastard?

             INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a FINGER.  Running along a row of book spines.
             Brundt...Buckley...Buss...Buckham...Byrie...

             PULL BACK to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore.
             Still in his funeral clothes.

             In the "Mystery!" section.  Not finding what he wants.  Then,
             something catches his eye:  A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the 
             aisle.  Will limps down to it.  Avoides eye-contact with a
             YOUNG WOMAN shelving "New Arrivals!"

             Reaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks.
             Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd.
             Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for:
             Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover.

             A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side.
             Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada.  He graduated...

             Will's eyes skip down to the bottom:

             Mr. Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two
             labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi.

             Will looks up.  Slaps the book closed.

             INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY

             Will drives, sipping take-out coffee.  Trying to fight the 
             stinging in his eyes.  Passes a sign:  Umkumiut, 30 miles.

             EXT. TESORO ALASKA GAS STATION - UMKUMIUT - DAY

             Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station.  Flips
             through the phone book.  His finger tracing down the "B"s.
             Finds it:  Walter Byrd, 451 S. Diamond Tooth, Apt. B.

             EXT. DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY

             Sky's become overcast.  Will stands across the street from a
             pale blue building.  On the ground floor, a tackle store.
             Above, looks like several apartment units.

             He starts across.

             INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

             Will heads down a narrow hallway.  Tiled floor.  Passes door
             "A."  Stops at the next one, "B."  Knocks.  Hears nothing but
             the muted tv from apartment "A."  Pulls out his gloves.

             INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY

             With a CLICK the door swings open.  Will, gloves on, pockets
             his credit card.  Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as
 
             TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING.  Will's
             prepared.  Takes a bag of treats from his pocket.

                                 WILL
                       Lucy.  Desi.

             The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats.
             Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy
             chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s
             movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  "Another
             Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat."

             Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of 
             a killer.  Looks into the
   
             BEDROOM

             Single bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich
             on the bedside table.  "NYPD BLUE" calendar on the wall.

             It's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window.
             Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder.
     
             On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles.  Some yellowing,
             some fresh.  All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life!"
             "Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug
             Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect..."

             Will curls his lip.  Starts looking through the papers on the
             desk.  Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH.  It's
             of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO
             TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred,
             turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio.

             Will takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of
             animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the
             back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips
             through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his
             pocket.  Slams the door closed.
  
             Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine.
             Slaps it back in place.  He's ready.

             SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  A beige rotary on the desk.
             Plugged into an ancient answering machine.  It RINGS again.
             The answering machine WHIRS.  Then BEEPS.

                                 WALTER'S VOICE
                       Now you're mad at me.

             Will freezes.

                                 WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...I spotted your car around the corner.
                       You must have been in a hurry.  Put some
                       pieces together.  Don't worry, I would
                       have done the same thing...

             Will turns back to the window.  Looking furiously...

                                 WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
                       Anyway...
                           (blows nose)
                       ...I'm not coming home.  So you
                       shouldn't wait there all day.  I mean,
                       they'll wonder about you at the station.
                       You should be careful about following
                       procedure, Will, especially now that...

             Will lunges for the phone.  Snatches it up just as CLICK! the
             tape cuts off.

                                 WILL
                       Goddammit!

             Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall.

             INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

             Will exits the apartment.  Cradling his hand.  Looks down at
             the tile floor.  Scanning it for a broken tile.  Finds one.
             Bends down and plucks out a broken corner.

             Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the
             door jamb.  Just then.  His BEEPER goes off.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             Will strides into the bullpen.  Wounded hand in pocket.
             Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter.  Glances up.

             Fred, over in the corner.  SLAMS a drawer in the filing
             cabinet.  Turns.

                                 FRED
                       Forget your pager?

                                 WILL
                       What?

                                 FRED
                       I beeped you over two hours ago.

             Holds out a one-page report.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Got a fax from the lab.  Murder weapon
                       was a 357 Ruger.

             Will takes the report.  Heads over to the coffee machine.

                                 WILL
                       Good.

                                 FRED
                       And something else that might interest 
                       you.

             He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  Holds
             it up.  Otherwise Engaged.  In hardback.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       Remember this?

             Will blinks.

                                 WILL
                       No.

                                 FRED
                       One of the paperbacks we found in Kay
                       Connell's knapsack.

             Will pours himself a cup of coffee.  Trying to keep the
             stream steady.  Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK...

                                 WILL
                       That's right.

                                 FRED
                       Mrs. Connell found this copy in the 
                       house.
                           (opens it up)
                       It's signed.  Personally.

                                 WILL
                       So?

                                 FRED
                       This is a local writer.  Kay had all his
                       books.  I think we should check it out.

             CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin.  Looks back at
             the report.  Judicious.

                                 WILL
                       I don't think it'll lead anywhere.

             The CLACKING stops.  SILENCE.  Will turns around.  Ellie's
             staring right at him - that isn't like him.

             He turns back to Fred.  Beat.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call.

             The CLACKING resumes.

             INT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT

             A dark stairway.  Late at night.  Will, bathed in shadows.
             Climbs to the top.  Quietly, carefully.  He heads down a
             hallway.  We recognise it.  Back where Walter Byrd lives.
 
             Will approaches apartment "B."  Slowly pulls out his weapon.
             Cocks it.  Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door.
             Ready to fight.  Ready to confront.  Looks down...

             Tile corner's still there.

             INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY

             CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open.
             Scrawled in pencil:  8:30.  Dr. Agee.

             PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee.  The
             appointment book on the passenger seat.  Been there all night.

             Insomnia.  Taking its toll.  His hair, no longer neatly
             combed.  His face, pale and unshaven.  His eyes, dragged open
             from fatigue.  Looks like the whole world's pulling him down.
             Staring down the street at a
   
             BRICK BUILDING on the corner.  A placard by the front door:
             Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.

             Will checks his watch.  Rubs his eyes with the heels of his
             hands.  Suddenly.  Something tells him to look up.

             A MAN

             in the distance, walking along the road.  Towards Dr. Agee's.
             He's in his forties.  Short, shoulders sloped.  Wears a 
             beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.

             WALTER BYRD

             has a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  Is looking down at the
             road.  Glances up.

             LOCKS EYES WITH WILL

             Byrd, slows his pace.

             Will, reaches for the door handle.

             SUDDENLY

             Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.

             Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.

             WALTER BYRD

             his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road.
             Veers over to it.

             WILL

             a runner's stride.  Weaves through PEOPLE.  Closing in on
             Byrd.  Sees his plan.  Cuts across the road just as...

             A PICK-UP

             rounds the corner.  THUMP!  Broadsides him.  Will's pitched
             up and over the hood.  Falls hard on the tarmac.  Dazed for a
             second.  Blood, gushing from his forehead.  Hears the PICK-UP
             DOOR open...FEET running over to him.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       Are you alright?  You popped out from
                       nowhere!

             More FEET running over.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       He okay?

             Will opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in
             the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.

             Will struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him,
             wearing overalls.  Reaches out.

                                 OLD LADY
                       I don't think you should move.

             Will stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge.

             INT./EXT. PICK-UP

             The old lady rips along in the truck.  Will sits in the
             passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.  It's soaked
             with blood.  The lady looks over.

                                 OLD LADY
                       You sure you're okay?

                                 WILL
                       I'm fine.

                                 OLD LADY
                       Careful not to bleed on my interior.

             Will looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels
             like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the
             TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.

             EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

             AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus.  A windy
             coastal road.  Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.

             EXT. FERRY STATION - OUTSIDE UMKUMIUT - DAY

             A FERRY at the end of the pier.  A small wooden booth for
             selling tickets.  Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains
             on the other side of the bay.  Nothing else for miles around.

             The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.
             Will jumps out.  Scans the area for Byrd.  Nothing.  Then,
             sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.

             INT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER

             Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  Most
             everyone is inside.  TOURISTS with throw-away cameras,
             backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN.  Some looking sea-sick in the
             corner.

             Will weaves through the crowd.  Eyes darting, searching.  The
             ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots

             WALTER BYRD standing by a window.

             INT. WINDOW - FERRY

             Walter holds on to the railing.  Looking at the view, the sea
             spray.  Will comes up.  Stands next to him.  Cognizant of the
             people around them.

                                 WILL
                       Walter Byrd.

             Walter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed-
             nose voice.

                                 WALTER
                       When I was seven my mother and
                       grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We
                       were walking along the street one day
                       when these two men ran past and snatched
                       my grandmother's purse right from under
                       her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That
                       night a police officer came to our hotel 
                       room to ask us questions.  Stood the
                       whole time.

             The ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing.
             Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes
                       and badge were polished, his billy club,
                       his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was
                       like a soldier, but better.

             Walter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in
             disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From
             beating Kay Connell to death.

                                 WALTER (cont'd) 
                       Made a huge impression on me.  His
                       goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for
                       the police.  I tried to become a cop when
                       I left high school, but...

             He points to his hearing-aid.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Congenital problem.

             The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Oh.  We're here.

             EXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY

             Gendreau Glacier.  Spilling down between two huge mountains.
             Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.

             Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other
             tourists.  Walter leads the way.  Hands in his pockets.

                                 WALTER
                       You know this glacier moves a quarter of
                       an inch every day?

             He points off to the horizon.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       And on a clear day you can see all the
                       way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful
                       aviary over there.  We can go sometime.

             Will's lip curls.  Watching him.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       It's actually cool for this time of year.
                       Normally the temperature runs about...

             SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise
             as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely
             keeping control.

                                 WILL
                       You think this is a nice meeting we're 
                       having here?  Friendly?  Two people
                       getting acquainted?
                           (jerks him harder)
                       You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every
                       morning of my life just to bring someone
                       like you down.  Beating a seventeen year-
                       old girl to death.  Washing her
                       afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel
                       like a real man?
                           (tightens his grip)
                       Huh?

             Walter flounders.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I outta end this right now.  Take a rock
                       and smash your fucking skull in...

             His jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced,
             sputtering...

                                 WALTER 
                       I stood right behind you...I saw you look
                       right into his eyes and shoot him...

             Will clenches his teeth.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his
                       own partner.  I saw it all...

                                 WILL
                       That was an accident!  You hear me?  I
                       didn't know it was him!
                           (shakes him hard)
                       I didn't know it was him!

             Just then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over

             A COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball
             fight.

             Will looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him
             away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges  
             his hearing aid.

             Watches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain.

                                 WALTER
                       Then why lie about it?

             Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts
             it back around his ear.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I mean, I'm all for bending the truth.
                       That's what I do in my novels.  It's my 
                       trade you might say.  But why cover it
                       up?

             Gets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something
             in his pocket.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       You don't have to tell me if you don't
                       want to.  I'm sure you have some reason.
                       Something noble.  I have faith in that.
 
             Looks down at the kids.  Shakes his head.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       They should be bundled up better.

                                 WILL
                       What's your game, Byrd?

             Walter turns back to him.

                                 WALTER
                       No game.

                                 WILL
                       The phone call.  The knapsack.

             Walter shrugs.

                                 WALTER
                       I figured we're partners on this one.  I
                       mean, after what I saw...

             Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to
             throttle this weed.

                                 WILL
                       Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are
                       partners on nothing.

             Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head.

                                 WALTER
                       I research my novels.  I know the 
                       procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at
                       the ferry.  You'd have called for back-
                       up, read me my rights, and gotten a
                       search warrant for my apartment.  You're
                       a well-respected detective.  There's
                       no reason for you to be talking to me
                       right now...

             He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       ...except that we could help each other.

             Will stares at him.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       So.  We're at an impasse.

             Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart
             pounding.  Turns to watch...

             THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their
             GIGGLES carried along by the wind.

             Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every
             instinct in his body.

                                 WILL
                           (sotto)
                       You're going to get a phone call.

             Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.

                                 WALTER
                       I'm sorry?

                                 WILL
                       I said you're going to get a phone call.

                                 WALTER 
                           (perks up)
                       Oh?

                                 WILL
                       Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of
                       your books.

                                 WALTER
                       Thought you might find that.

                                 WILL
                       You're going to be brought in for
                       questioning.

             Walter smiles.  Pleased.

                                 WALTER
                       Down at the station?

                                 WILL
                           (hisses)
                       Yes down at the station.

             Walter rubs his hands together.  Thinking.

                                 WALTER
                       Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning.
                       Good.  I can write this.

             JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter
             looks down at it.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Ferry's leaving.

             He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to
             follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Something to divert...

             Snaps his fingers.  An idea.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       My gun.  You still have my gun, right?

             Will nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Then that's the wild card.  Every
                       detective story has a wild card.

                                 WILL
                       What do you mean, "wild card?"

             TOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry.

                                 WALTER
                       Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.

             Walter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his
             side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to
             Walter.

                                 WILL
                       What do you mean "wild card?"

             Walter looks back.  Waves.

                                 WALTER
                       You'll know.  At the questioning.

             Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back
             to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again.

             Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning
             up water.  Starting forward just as...

             Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds
             it up for Will to see.

             Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his 
             body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists
             towards the ramp but...

             A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker,
             grabs his arm.

                                 TICKET TAKER
                           (to Will)
                       Full up.

             Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter
             Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance.

             INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a counter top.  Stuff thrown down.  Aspirin.  Band-
             aids.  Gauze.  Medical tape.  First aid cream.  Back pills.
             Sleeping pills.  Bottle of scotch.

             PULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the
             convenience store.  His entire body aching.  The CASHIER,
             throws him a look.

                                 WILL
                       I have a cold.

             EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER

             Will exits the store.  A bag under his arm.  We Miss You, Kay
             looming over his shoulder.  Steps out onto the sidewalk and
             sees...

             ELLIE leaning against her truck.  Waiting for him.  Smiles.

                                 ELLIE
                       Which way are you walking?

             A tingle, all across Will's body.  Christ.  This girl's
             everywhere!  He hunches into his coat.  Flicks up his collar.
             Doesn't want her to see him fully.  Nods down the road.

                                 WILL
                       Back to the Lodge.

             Ellie grabs her bag.  Joins him.  They start walking.

                                 ELLIE
                       I needed to get your signature on
                       something.

             She pulls a folder from her bag.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       The report on Detective Eckhart.  Chief
                       made me finish it this morning.  Said it
                       was taking too long.

             Will takes the file.  Flips it open.  The death of his
             partner.  Neatly typed.  Neatly stapled.  Pulls out a pen.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Aren't you going to read it?

                                 WILL
                       I trust you.

             He signs.  Hands it back to her.  She slips it into her bag.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       Now I can help you with the Connell case. 
                       That writer's coming in tomorrow.  Walter
                       Byrd.

             A slight stutter in Will's step.

                                 WILL
                       Duggar called him?

                                 ELLIE
                       About an hour ago.  Said he was more than
                       happy to cooperate.

             Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.  Studying
             his face.  His gait.  Noticing the slight limp in his right
             leg.  The cut on his forehead.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       You haven't been sleeping much, have you,
                       Detective Dormer?

             They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.

                                 WILL
                       Not really.

                                 ELLIE
                       Isn't that the difference between a good
                       cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't
                       sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's
                       missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause
                       his conscience won't let him.
                           (smiles)
                       You said that once, remember?

             Will, finally looks at her.

                                 WILL
                       No.  But it sounds like something I
                       would've said.

             Turns and starts up the steps.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       See you tomorrow, Ellie.

             Ellie, watches him for a second.  Then calls out.

                                 ELLIE
                       Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  The Puffins
                       won.

             Will stops, turns to look back at her.  Confused.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       The baseball game.  Our team...

             Slings the bag over her shoulder.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       ...We won.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - LATE NIGHT

             Clock flicks to 3:00 A.M.  Will, pacing in his room.  Shirt
             off.  Rib cage wrapped in a bandage.  Looking through...

             A STACK OF MESSAGES.  All from John Warfield.  He discards
             them one by one.  Can barely focus...

             SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  He lunges for it.

                                 WILL
                           (grabbing it)
                       Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch...

             Interrupted by a CLICK...

                                 RECORDED VOICE
                       ...I saw you look right into his eyes
                       and shoot him...

             Walter Byrd's voice.  Recorded from that afternoon.

                                 RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)
                       ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his
                       own partner.  I saw it all...

             Will, hears his own voice...

                                 RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)
                       That was an accident!...

                                 WILL
                       Goddammit, Byrd!

             Then, another clumsy CLICK.  Walter Byrd gets on.

                                 WALTER
                       You'd have done the same thing, Will.  I
                       know you would...

             He hangs up.

             Will SLAMS down the receiver.  Then again.  And again.  Yanks
             the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

             ...The DARK FIGURE.  Disappearing back into the fog.  Closing
             in around him like milky water...

             We whip out our SMITH 39/13...plunge in after him...taking
             chase...BREATHING hard...leaping from rock to rock...the FOG,
             blanket thick...tightening around us...

             Our feet.  Hit water.  Up to our ankles.  Icy cold.  We
             run...sloshing through...when...

             SUDDENLY

             A DARK FIGURE.  Appears ahead.  Big and hulking...CRASHING
             towards us...

             We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE
             emerges...

             And in a split second...

             WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle...

             CRACK!  We fire!  The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the
             water.

             Heart POUNDING.  Adrenaline PUMPING.  We slosh towards the
             body.  Something...catching our eye...

             A 357 RUGER

             lying in the rocks.  Off to the side.  We grab it.  Turn back
             to the body...

             And stop cold.

             That's when it hits us.  That's when we realize...

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

             Will bolts up.  White as a sheet.

                                 WILL
                       I didn't know!

             His body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and
             ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks
             across the room and sees

             HAP

             sitting in the corner.  Eating an apple with a penknife.

                                 HAP
                       You sure about that, buddy?

             He smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as...

             The BLANKET.  Drops to the floor.  

             LIGHT floods the room.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M.

             With a GRUNT Will puts his back into it.  Shoving the heavy
             oak bureau towards the window.  Sweat beading his face.

             A...few...more...shoves.  And the bureau finally stands in
             front of the window.  WIll stands back to take a look.  Only
             covers half of it.

                                 WILL
                       Fuck!

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

             Red-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire.  Shimmying it 
             towards the window...

                                                                   CUT TO:

             EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT

             Ellie.  Sitting in her truck.  Parked behind the Pioneer
             Lodge.  Rubbbing her eyes.  Sleepy.  Looking up at
   
             WILL'S WINDOW

             concerned.

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

             With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window.
             Light still shining through the cracks.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M.

             Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows.  Anything.
             To fill the cracks.  To cover the light.  His eyes.  Like a
             crazy man's...

             SUDDENLY a knock on the door.  Will turns.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer?

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Rachel standing out in the hallway.  Will opens the door.

                                 RACHEL
                           (startled by his appearance)
                       Will...I...

                                 WILL
                       What is it?

                                 RACHEL
                       There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining
                       about the noise.
                           (beat)
                       Says he can't sleep.

             Will gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into...

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             ...his room.  Rachel follows.  Looks around at the mess.

                                 RACHEL
                       Are you alright?

             Will grabs up a sweater.

                                 WILL
                       I'm fine.

             He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the
             stuff piled up.  Softens her voice.

                                 RACHEL
                       Did something happen?

             Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack.

                                 WILL
                       No.

             Rachel walks up behind him.  His cramming, more desperate.
             More urgent.

                                 RACHEL
                       Will...

             He grabs a magazine.

                                 WILL
                       The light.  It keeps coming in...

             Rachel reaches out.  Catches his arm.

                                 RACHEL
                       Will.

             He stops.  Looks down at her hand.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       What happened?

             Will suddenly realises what he's doing.  Absurd.  Pathetic. 
             Pitiful.  Slowly turns to face Rachel.

             Her eyes, looking up at him.  His shoulders droop.
             Exhausted.  Rachel reaches up.  Catches him in her arms.
             Strong arms.  Caring.  Will buries his face in her neck.
             Wants to be swallowed up.

             Rachel holds him.  Arms encircling.  Will breathes her in.
             Sweet, soft, safe.

             Looks up.  His mouth suddenly finding hers.  A kiss, hungry,
             urgent.  His arms move to surround her.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATER

             Will and Rachel in bed.  Spooning.  Rachel behind will, her
             finger tracing his scar.  Rain DRUMS against the window.

             Will.  Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass.
             Casting strange shadows against the wall.

                                 WILL
                       There was this guy named Weston Dobbs.
                       Twenty-four.  Worked as a part-time stock
                       boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd
                       sit at the only window in his apartment
                       and watch an eight year-old boy get
                       picked up by his carpool across the
                       street.  And every afternoon he'd watch
                       the boy get dropped off again.  He did
                       this for about six months.  Until one day
                       he got up the nerve to cross the street
                       and grab the boy before his carpool came.
                       Kept him in his apartment for three days.
                       Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do
                       things...

             Will tenses his jaw.  Rachel, listens in horror.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       When he was done, he got a rope and a
                       kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the
                       basement of the apartment building.  But
                       he didn't do a good enough job.  The
                       little boy's neck didn't break and he
                       died from shock.  The landlord found him
                       five days later.

             Rachel reaches for Will's hand.  Squeezes it.

                                 RACHEL
                       One of your cases?

                                 WILL
                       Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I
                       knew the second I met Dobbs that he was
                       guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had
                       circumstantial evidence, but nothing to
                       tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went
                       over every inch of that apartment.

             He pauses.

                                 RACHEL
                       What happened?

             Will turns slowly over to face her.  Her hair, splayed out on
             the pillow.  Her cheeks, flushed.  Her eyes, listening.

                                 WILL
                       We took some blood samples from the boy's
                       body and planted them in his apartment.
                           (beat)
                       Arrested him the next day.

             Rachel looks at him.  Goose pimples on her arms.  Realising
             the weight of the confession.

                                 RACHEL
                       Will.

                                 WILL
                       There've been other cases.  Where we've
                       changed results.  Pushed witnesses.
                       Manipulated evidence.
                           (rubs his face)
                       But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than
                       anything.

             He sits up.  Abrupt.  Wincing from the pain in his ribs.
             Rests his arms on his knees.

                                 RACHEL
                       What if someone finds out?

                                 WILL
                       We're under investigation now.  Back in
                       Seattle.
                           (beat)
                       Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got
                       back.  Thought he could work out some
                       kind of deal.

             Rachel rubs his shoulder.

                                 RACHEL
                       Well, that's not going to happen now.

             Will closes his eyes.  The rain, PATTERING.  Rhythmic.

                                 WILL
                       Do you think it was wrong?  What we did?

             There's a PAUSE.  Rachel, studying Will's back.  The cuts.
             The bruises.  Not sure how to answer.

                                 RACHEL
                       There are two kinds of people in Alaska. 
                       Those who were born here and those who've
                       come here to escape something in their
                       lives.
                           (beat)
                       I wasn't born here, Will.  I'm in no
                       position to judge anyone.  I'm not about
                       that any more.

             Looks out the window.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       It's all about what you're willing to
                       live with.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - MORNING

             The clock reads 6:00.  Will pulls on his trousers.  Goes to
             strap on his Smith 39/13 holster.  Grimaces with pain.  Looks
             at his back in the full-length mirror.  BLACK BRUISES seeping
             out from under his bandage.

             Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau.
             Turns and looks down at Rachel.  Sleeping soundly.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       You were acquainted with the deceased,
                       Kay Connell?

             INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             Will in the interrogation room.  Standing by the window.
             Tensed jaw.

                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Yes I was.

             WALTER BYRD

             sits at the table.  Hair combed, wet.  Shirt newly starched.
             A Styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him.  Playing the part.

             Fred sits opposite him.  Report file open.  Ellie, next to
             Fred.  Taking notes.  She's combed her hair, too.

                                 FRED
                       In what manner?

             Walter smiles modestly.  Looks over at Ellie.

                                 WALTER
                       She was, not quite a "fan."  More an avid
                       reader of my detective novels.

                                 ELLIE
                       When did you first meet her?

             Fred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth.

                                 WALTER
                       A year ago.  At one of my signings.

             Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds
             it up.  Opened to the signature.

                                 FRED
                       Where you signed this?

                                 WALTER
                       That's right.

                                 FRED
                       What happened at that signing?

                                 WALTER
                       She flattered me about my writing.  Asked
                       if she could visit me.  To talk about my
                       books.

                                 FRED
                       Did she?

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then
                       she became more comfortable.  Started 
                       visiting me every week...

             Will, from over by the window.  Interrupts.

                                 WILL
                       What was the nature of your relationship?

             Walter looks over.  Wide-eyed.

                                 WALTER
                       What do you mean, Detective Dormer?

             Will turns.  Accusatory.

                                 WILL
                       She was an attractive girl.  Did you have
                       sex with her?

             Walter blinks.

                                 WALTER
                       She was only seventeen.

                                 WILL
                       But she was an attractive girl.
 
                                 WALTER
                       I suppose.

                                 WILL
                       Did you have sex with her?

             Fred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him.

                                 WALTER
                       No.

                                 WILL
                       But you wanted to.

                                 WALTER
                       I was a mentor to her.

             Will heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his
             pockets.

                                 WILL
                       You gave her gifts.

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.

                                 WILL
                       Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.

                                 WILL
                       Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.

                                 WALTER
                       I gave her things she didn't have.
                       Couldn't have.

             He turns to Fred and Ellie.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Her family lives on Mr. Connell's
                       disability.  It isn't much.

             Fred stops Will with a look.  Had enough.

                                 FRED
                       We understand, Mr. Byrd.
                           (to Will)
                       You want to sit down, Detective?

             Tense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back
             over to the window.

                                 WALTER
                       She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk
                       to.

                                 FRED
                       How do you mean?

                                 WALTER
                       That boyfriend.  Randy.

             Fred, sits up.

                                 FRED
                       Randy Stetz?

                                 WALTER
                       That's right.

                                 WILL
                       What about him?

                                 WALTER
                       He.  Well, he...

             Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay
                       told me things in the strictest of
                       confidence.  As a friend.

                                 FRED
                       Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could
                       help out with this case.

             Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid.

                                 WALTER
                       Well.  He hit her.

             Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too
             busy watching this little man weave his web.

                                 FRED
                       Are you sure about that?

                                 WALTER
                       She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle
                       of the night.  Bruises all over her back,
                       her upper arms.  I pled with her to let
                       me call the police, but she wouldn't hear
                       it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.

                                 ELLIE
                       Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?

                                 FRED
                           (angry)
                       Ellie.

             Walter looks right at her.

                                 WALTER
                       He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he
                       carried a handgun around with him.

             Fred stands.  This is big.  Calls out the door.

                                 FRED
                       Margaret!  Get Judge Biggs on the phone!
                           (to Will)
                       I'll get another warrant for Stetz's
                       place.

             Walter takes a sip of his coffee.  Cup's empty.  Holds it out
             to Ellie.  Smiles.

                                 WALTER
                       Could I have some more coffee, Detective
                       Burr?

             Ellie nods, takes the cup.  Heads over to the coffee machine.
             Fred turns back to the door...

             AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will.

             Mouths the words Wild Card.

             A shiver down Will's spine.  Wild card.  The gun.  Randy.

             ELLIE

             over at the coffee machine.  Pouring coffee.  Glances up at
             the window.  Catches the reflection of the two men.

             An intense look between them.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a BOOT.  Jumping down onto a black rock.

             PULL BACK to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach.  Heading
             down towards the water.  Thinking.

             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             A dark, narrow boarding room.  A HAND reaches through an open
             window.  Feels for the lock on the door.  CLICK.

             Will enters Randy Stetz's place.  Cigarette butts, electric
             guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.

             He looks around.  Every inch of him revolting against what
             he's about to do.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS

             The sound of waves.  A slight breeze.  Ellie walking along
             the water.

             Looking down.  Brow furrowed.  Stops and puts her hands on
             her hips.

             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the
             room.  Pulls it aside.  A MOTORBIKE being repaired.  Parts
             and tools all over the place.

             Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief.
             Spots a COFFEE CAN on a shelf.  Filled with thick oil.

             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS

             Something catches Ellie's eye.  GLINTING from between the
             rocks.  She bends down.  Pulls a pencil from her backpack.
             Spears something and holds it up.

             A SHELL CASING.

             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
 
             Will, drops the 357 into the oil.  Turns and heads back
             across the room.  Hesitates.  At the door.  Turns back.
             Looking at the oil can.  Takes a step back towards it when he
             hears...

             The sound of a SQUAD CAR.  Pulling up outside.

             Too late.

             EXT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - LATER

             Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room.
             UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place.  Tearing down
             pictures.  Turning out doors.  Ripping up carpet.  Randy's
             voice.  In protest.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       You can't fucking do this!

             Will hears some SCUFFLING.  The sheet being pulled down.  The
             CLATTER of tools.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       Hey!  I'm working on that!

             Parts pulled off the shelves.  The bike, shoved to the side.
             Then.  A SILENCE.  Followed by...

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                       Found something.

             Will shuts his eyes.  Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike.
             Someone's pulled the gun from the can.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       What the fuck is that!

             Fred's voice, calm.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       That's it.  Let's bag it.

             More FOOTSTEPS.  Randy, desperate.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       That's not mine, man!  That's not mine!

             Will opens his eyes.  Fred's voice.  Almost sympathetic.

                                 FRED (O.S.)
                       Randy...

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                       No way, man!

             More SCUFFLING.  A chair knocked over.  Something SMASHES.
             Will looks down at the floor as

             FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the
             doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams.

                                 RANDY (cont'd)
                       That ain't mine!

             Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.

                                 FRED
                       C'mon, Randy.

             Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone
             is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost
             kid.  Tears streaming down his face.

                                 RANDY
                       I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I 
                       swear to God...

             EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY

             Will stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his
             coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with
             Randy Stetz in the back.

             Fred sees him, heads over.

                                 FRED
                       You look like shit, cowboy.

             Will shifts his eyes to him.

                                 WILL
                       That's an understatement.

             Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car.

                                 FRED
                       Looks like we can wrap this one up.

             Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on.

                                 FRED (cont'd)
                       We're getting together for a couple of
                       beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle
                       thing to do.  But you're welcome to come.

             Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him.
             Takes it.

             INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

             CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer.  Five glasses, foam sloshing.

                                 FARRELL (O.S.)
                       I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz.

             PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting
             at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive
             bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall.
             Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN.

             Rich takes a glass from Fred.

                                 RICH
                       What do you mean, you can't believe it?

                                 FRANCIS
                       He was an asshole.

                                 FARRELL
                       That doesn't mean anything.

             Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell.

                                 FRED
                       Didn't you grow up with him?

             Farrell shifts in his seat.

                                 FARRELL
                       Our dads were on the same boat.
                           (to Will)
                       We used to wait for them together.

             Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer.

                                 FRANCIS
                       He used to pick fights at the gas
                       station.

                                 RICH
                       And remember when he did all those donut
                       holes that one summer?

             He and Francis GUFFAW.

                                 FRED
                       Just a bad seed.

             Farrell looks over at Will.

                                 FARRELL
                       How do you like our beer?

             Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and
             shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke.

                                 WILL
                       I like it fine.

             Fred pats Will's shoulder.

                                 FRED
                       What Detective Dormer needs is a little
                       shut-eye.

                                 RICH
                       The white nights been hard on you?

                                 WILL
                       They haven't been easy.

             Francis grabs a handful of peanuts.

                                 FRANCIS
                       They don't have titanium shades over at
                       the Pioneer.

                                 RICH
                       Well no wonder.

                                 FRANCIS
                       You lose all sense of time.

                                 FARRELL
                       Better than Fred's home town.

             Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache.

                                 FRED
                       My people are from Barrow.  Way up north.

                                 RICH
                       In the winter there's no sunlight for
                       five straight months.

                                 FRED
                       Like being swallowed up in a black hole.

             JUST THEN.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Hi, guys.

             They look up.  Ellie standing by their table.  Jeans, down
             vest.  Hair tousled.

                                 FRED
                       Nancy Drew!  Pull up a seat!

                                 FRANCIS
                       You hear what happened, Ellie?

                                 ELLIE
                       Yeah.

                                 RICH
                       Pretty cool.

                                 FARRELL
                       Rich found the gun.

                                 ELLIE
                       I know.  I heard.

             Fred leans back in his seat.  Eyeballs Ellie.

                                 FRED
                       Something's on Nancy's mind.

             Ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  Pulls out a Ziploc with
             the SHELL CASING inside.

                                 ELLIE
                       I found this out on the beach.

                                 FARRELL
                       What is it?

                                 ELLIE
                       Shell casing.  9mm.

             Will, blanches.

                                 FRANCIS
                       Let it go, Ell.  We got the bad guy.

                                 ELLIE
                       None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon.
                       And the murder weapon was a 357.

             Rich throws peanut shells at her.

                                 RICH
                       Get a hobby, will ya?

             Ellie brushes off the shells.  Looks right at Will.

                                 ELLIE
                       It's a legitimate point, isn't it,
                       Detective Dormer?

             Everyone turns to Will.  Their faces, spinning.  He nods.

                                 WILL
                       It's legitimate.

                                 ELLIE
                       Worth pursuing?

             He looks up.  Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the
             side of the table.

                                 WILL
                       The case is closed, Ellie.
                           (gets up)
                       I got the next round.

             The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar.
             Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke.
             MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound.
             Like being swallowed up in a black hole...

             Looks back at the table.
 
             Ellie, watching him.

             EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

             Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house.  She jumps
             out.  

             INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT

             SLAM!  Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of
             wind.  Thunders up the stairs.  Calls out.

                                 ELLIE
                       Me, Pop!

             We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's
             father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble,
             big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe.

                                 ELLIE'S DAD
                       Ellie?  You okay?

             Ellie appears at the top of the stairs.

                                 ELLIE
                       Where's all my academy stuff?

             INT. BASEMENT

             Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on.
             Ellie stands beneath it.  Piles of crap everywhere.

             She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto
             parts.  Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner.

             She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops.  In
             thick black pen.  Shoves a couple aside.

             Then.  Finds what she's looking for.  Pulls down a box
             marked:  Ellie Acad.  Tears it open.

             INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS,
             schedules, syllabi, handbooks.  Stuff from her Academy year.
             At the bottom, a report.  The title:  "Securing the Crime
             Scene," the Leland Street Murders.  By Eleanor P. Burr.

             Ellie pulls it out.  Sits down on an old stool.  Opens to the
             middle of the report.  Her finger, tracing down the 
             typewritten page.  Flips to the next page.  Then the next.
             The next.  Then.  She spots it.

             THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the
             sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson
             model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley...

             Ellie looks up.  Chews her bottom lip.

             EXT. MARINERS MEMORIAL - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             CLOSE ON a huge wave CRASHING against a retaining wall.
             Spray flying.

             PULL BACK to reveal a small monument by the sea.  A stone
             cupola with a bronze statue underneath.  The sky, black with
             clouds.

             INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS

             Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial.  Wind
             whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him.  Next
             to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough.
             Holding on to a thick coil of rope.

             Hunches against the wind.  Watches as...
 
             WILL approaches the monument.  Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled
             coat.  Face drawn and haggard.  Angry.

                                 WALTER
                           (smiles)
                       Hi, Will...

             Will enters the monument.

                                 WILL
                       What the hell are you doing calling me at 
                       the station?

             A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.

                                 WALTER
                       I figured we should touch base.  Compare
                       notes.  I think it went well.  What did
                       you think?

             Will's eyes pierce into him.

                                 WILL
                       Randy Stetz is in jail.

                                 WALTER
                       Told you I could write an ending.

                                 WILL
                       Congratulations.

             Will holds out his hand.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       The tape.

             Walter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him.

                                 WALTER
                       I thought maybe we could talk some more.

                                 WILL
                       There's nothing more to talk about.

                                 WALTER
                       But we work so well together...

             Will breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the
             concrete pilasters.

                                 WILL
                       We do nothing well together.
                           (SLAMS him again)
                       Nothing!  You understand me?

             Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into
             Will's bloodshot eyes.

                                 WALTER
                       You run on two settings, Will.  I've 
                       noticed that...

             Will tightens his grip.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       You jump from calm to rage in the blink
                       of an eye.  That's okay.  I do that too.

             He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the
             side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and
             HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily.

             Walter watches him.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       You're not sleeping, are you?

                                 WILL
                       What the hell do you know?

                                 WALTER
                       Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know.   
                       Tells me things.  About you.  About me.

             PAUSE.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Does Detective Eckhart come to you?

             Will curls his fists.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Does he ask you why you shot him?

             Whips around...

                                 WILL 
                       I told you that was an accident!

                                 WALTER
                       Then so was mine...

                                 WILL
                       Don't you pull that shit with me.

                                 WALTER
                       I didn't want to kill her, Will.

             Steps closer to him.  Beseeching.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       When she called me that night from the
                       party, she'd had a fight with Randy.
                       Wanted to talk.  I told her to meet me at
                       our special place.  The cabin at the
                       beach...

             A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings.
             SCREECHING into the wind.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       ...When she came she was barefoot.  And
                       there was liquor on her breath.  I only
                       wanted to comfort her.  To touch her.
                       She could have at least let me do that.
                       Her skin...it was like everything I'd
                       ever written about.

             A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope
             of the statue.  Will hisses.

                                 WILL
                       Couldn't get it up, Walter?

                                 WALTER
                       It was when I went to kiss her.  She
                       started laughing.  I got angry.  After
                       all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with
                       her.  I just wanted to make her stop.
                       That's all.

             Walter.  Squeezing the bronze rope.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       From calm to rage in the blink of an eye.

             Locks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Remember?

             WILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck.

                                 WILL
                       Like this?

             Walter's face, starts turning red.

                                 WALTER
                       Yes.  Like that.

                                 WILL
                       This an accident, Walter?

                                 WALTER
                       If you want it to be...

             Will looks deep into Walter's eyes.  Squeezing harder.  Pure
             hatred.

                                 WILL
                       It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell
                       to death.  Ten minutes.

             Their eyes, locked.  Veins, popping along Walter's temples.
             Lip quivering...

             JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance.  Will looks up.

             A LINE OF FISHING BOATS coming back in.

             Will, looks back at Walter.  Throws him to the ground.
             Sickened.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Get the fuck out of town, Byrd.  Leave
                       and never come back.

             Walter COUGHS.  Holding his neck.  Enjoying this.

                                 WALTER
                       I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake.
                       I'm going to write my next novel there.
                       It's about a famous detective who goes
                       bad.

             Will shoots him a look.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Just kidding.

             He pulls himself to his feet.  A little unsteady.  Takes out
             a handkerchief.  Dabs his forehead.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       The never coming back part, though.  I'm
                       not sure.  To tell you the truth this has
                       been kind of fun.  Going to the station,
                       meeting all those nice people.  Talking
                       with you.

             He shrugs.  Walks past Will.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I might miss it.

             Will turns.  Watches him walk away.  Walter hesitates.  Turns
             back.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       I especially like that new detective.

             Will looks at him.  Back straightening.

                                 WALTER (cont'd)
                       Detective Burr.
                           (smiles)
                       I liked her very much.  Has a real
                       vitality.

             Will's stomach jumps.  Walter turns back.  Continues on.

             The little man in a beige windbreaker.

             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

             CLOSE ON a HAND.  Signing the bottom of a form.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
                       I was hoping not to send you back with so
                       much paperwork, Will.

             PULL BACK to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk.  Will
             stands before him.  Signing papers.  A bottle of bourbon on
             the desk.  Some paper cups half filled.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       When are you taking off?

             Will checks his watch.

                                 WILL
                       Six-thirty.

             Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet.  Toothpick in his
             mouth.

                                 FRED
                       If Spencer's not too drunk to fly.

             Nyback chuckles.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Can't talk you into staying for a couple of
                       days?  Do some fishing?  Show you what
                       normally goes on around here.

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       I have to get back.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Too bad...

             Looks over at Fred picking his teeth.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
                       ...Brought some real class to the place.
                       But, Seattle needs its hero back.
                           (stands)
                       Couldn't have done it without you, Will.

             Will caps the pen.  Uncomfortable.  Nods towards Fred.

                                 WILL
                       Had a lot of help from Nightmute's 
                       finest.

             JUST THEN the door swings open.  They look over as

             ELLIE hurries in.  She smiles.  Looks tired.

                                 ELLIE
                       Didn't want to miss anything.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few
                       hours.

                                 ELLIE
                       Good.

                                 CHIEF NYBACK
                       Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.

                                 ELLIE
                       Sure.

             An awkward beat.  Ellie walks over to Will.  Looks up.
             Suddenly throws her arms around him.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I thought what you did on this case was
                       amazing.

             Will holds his hands out.  Not sure what to do.  Looks down
             at the top of Ellie's head.

             ELLIE'S HAND

             slips down his back.  Feeling for a holster.  For that 39/13.
             Nothing.  She breaks away.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       We're really going to miss you around
                       here.

             She and Will lock eyes.  Hold for a beat.

             He knows exactly what she was trying to do.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             Will, driving down Nightmute's main street.  He takes a left.
             Goes up a hill.  Glances out the window.  Passing by

             THE CEMETERY.  A cluster of headstones.  Something catches
             his eye.  He stops the car.

             EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

             Will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the
             cemetery.  Stops.  Puts his hands up to the bars.

             KAY CONNELL'S GRAVE

             on the other side.  Newly dug.  A mound of dirt.  Flowers,
             scattered by the wind.  Daughter and Friend...1982-1999.

             Will.  Grips the bars.  As if he's seeing it for the first
             time.  Really seeing it.

             Closes his eyes.
 
             What have I done?

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING
 
             Will's REFLECTION in the mirror.  He's showered.  Hair's
             combed.  Put on a clean suit.  Steps back.  Smooths down his
             lapels.  Just right.

             Turns to face the room.  Bed's made, mess cleaned up.  He
             heads over to the bureau, pulls out his Smith 39/13.  Lays it
             on the bed.

             Unclips his badge from his belt.  Lays it on the bed.  Takes
             something from the bedside table.  The BULLET found in Hap
             Eckhart.  Lays it on the bed.

             All neat.  All ordered.

             Reaches under the mattress.  Pulls out the PHOTOGRAPH of a
             blurry Walter Byrd standing in front of a house.  A radio
             tower in the background.  The call numbers: WKOZ.

             Will studies it.  Tears it in half.

             INT. BACK ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

             Rachel in the back room behind reception.  A pullman's
             kitchen, a desk, an old recliner.  Pouring some milk into a
             bowl for a CAT.  A stray.

             Will walks in.  Rachel turns, smiles.

                                 RACHEL
                       I found a new friend.

             Will walks up to her.  Puts his arms around her.  Holds her,
             smells her, kisses her neck.  Pulls away.  Looks into her
             eyes.

                                 RACHEL (cont'd)
                       Will.  What is it?

             He doesn't answer.  The cat, rubs against his leg.  PURRING.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EVENING

             Will driving along a forest road.  Eyes dead ahead.  A map on
             the passenger seat.  By the fold, Kgun Lake circled in pencil.

             INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie working at her desk.  Looks up at the clock: 6:00.
             Gets up, grabs her down vest.  Heads for the door.  Farrell
             sticks the tip of his crutch in her path.  She stumbles.

                                 ELLIE
                       Very funny, Farrell...

             EXT. ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

             AERIAL VIEW of the silver Jeep Cherokee.  The only car on the
             road.  The sky, white-grey.  The trees, a blanket of green.
             The Cherokee heads around a hairpin curve.

             INT. LOBBY - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

             Rachel at reception.  Reading the paper.  Ellie walks in.

                                 ELLIE
                       Hi, Rachel.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

             Will, scanning the treeline.  Takes a left fork then stops.
             Thought he saw something.  Grinds the gear, backs up.  Takes
             another look.

             IN THE DISTANCE, a radio tower.  WKOZ.
 
             INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE WILL'S ROOM - EVENING

             Rachel and Ellie, standing outside Will's room.  Ellie knocks
             again.

                                 RACHEL
                       I would have seen if he came back.

             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

             The CLICK of a key and the door opens.  Ellie strides in.

                                 ELLIE
                       Detective Dormer?

             She stops.  Rachel behind her.  Taking in the strange feeling
             in the room.  Walks over to the bed.  Eyes riveted on the
             39/13.  On the bullet.  Rachel, behind her.

                                 RACHEL
                       What is all this?

             Ellie, her mind races.  Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the
             trash can.  Reaches in and pulls some out.  A puzzle.

             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - LAKE KGUN

             Will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway.
             Looming before him...

             A HOUSE right on the lake.  Tall, wooden, in disrepair.
             Chipping yellow paint.  A ghost of what it once was.  The
             house from the photograph.  

             INT. STUDY - HOUSE

             The CLANG of electric typewriter keys bang out a title:
             BLINK OF AN EYE, by Walter By

             WALTER BYRD hunched at his typewriter.  In an old study.
             Books stacked everywhere.  Light patches on the walls where
             pictures used to hang.

             BARKING outside.  Walter cocks his head.  Gets up.  Walks
             over to the window.  

             OUTSIDE.  Will walking up to the house.  Lucy and Desi
             jumping around him.

             INT. LIVING ROOM - SUMMER HOUSE

             Will opens the screen door with a CREAK.  Steps into the
             living room.

             Recoils from the smell.  Flies BUZZING.  Yellow plastic
             covering the sofas.  Boxes, books, papers, pictures piled
             high everywhere.  Wallpaper faded, peeling.

             Everything, decaying.

             INT./EXT. ELLIE'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck.  Gripping
             the wheel.  The photograph pieces, taped together on the
             passenger seat.

             INT. SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             Will heads down a hallway.  Dark, narrow, floorboards worn.
             More shit stacked up.

             Each step, careful, quiet.  Tracking.  Listening.  A BREEZE
             sweeps through.  The burned-out lightbulb hanging from the 
             ceiling, starts swinging.

                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Here to visit me?

             Will whips around.

             WALTER standing there.  At the other end of the hallway.
             Shoulders slumped.

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       No.

             FLIES, bouncing against the screen door.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       I'm here to end this.

             Walter looks around.

                                 WALTER
                       Where's your back-up?

                                 WILL
                       No back-up.

                                 WALTER
                       You're not following procedure.

                                 WILL
                       Procedure went out the window a long time
                       ago.

             Walter looks at him.

                                 WALTER
                       We're on the same side, Will.  You know
                       that.  After what we've been through
                       together.  We're partners.  Bound by a
                       secret.

             Will takes a step forward...

                                 WILL
                       That's where you're wrong, Walter.

             Slowly reaches into his jacket...

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       There is no secret.  Because the biggest
                       difference between you and me is what we
                       will or will not live with...

             Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON.  Walter.  Looks at the gun.
             Inches back.

                                 WALTER 
                       Will...

             SUDDENLY, darts out of sight.  Swings back into the doorway
             with a SHOTGUN...

             BAM!  Will's shoulder explodes with blood.

             EXT. DRIVEWAY - SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie, jumping out of her truck.  Hears the sound.  Looks up
             at the big, yellow house.  Pulls out her Glock 40.

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Walter walking down the hall.  Will, writhing on the floor,
             reaches for his back holster...gun's not there!

             Walter stands over him.  Swings his leg back and...CRACK!
             Kicks will in the ribs.  The pain, blinding.  Will GASPS.

             CRACK! again, CRACK! again, CRACK! again.  Walter's face.
             Calm, flushed.  A vein along his temple.  

             Will's eyes flutter.  Blood, spewing from his lips.  A THUD!
             to his kidneys.  Walter stops, out of breath.  Hand on hip.

                                 WALTER
                       You give the police a bad name, Will.

             WILL'S HAND suddenly shoots out.  Grabs the shotgun barrel.

             WALTER stumbles back.  The shotgun goes off.  BAM!  Chunks of
             ceiling rain down.  Walter falls to the ground.

             EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie, heart POUNDING.  Kicks the front door open...

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Will, covered in dry wall, struggling to his feet.  Reaches
             for his Smith and Wesson.

             WALTER'S DESERT BOOT kicks it out of the way.  It SKITTERS
             down the hall.

             Walter grabs his shotgun.  Scrambles to his feet.  Runs down
             to the end of the hall.  Ducks into...

             INT. LIBRARY

             ...the library.  Dirty shelves, strings of dust.  Endless
             books.  He races over to a cabinet.  Yanks open a DRAWER...

             INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             Will, on his feet, trying to focus.  His suit, soaked with
             blood.  Looking for his gun.  Spots it, in the corner...

             INT. LIBRARY

             Walter jerks open another drawer.  A STACK OF BOOKS teeter on
             the top of the cabinet.  He finds what he needs.  SHELLS.
             Grabs a handful...

             THE BOOKS tumble down on top of him.  He CRIES out, covering
             his head...touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone!
             Looks up.  Will, coming down the hall...

             INT. HALLWAY

             Will hobbles into the library.  Sweeps the room with this gun.
             No Walter.

             Steps on something, crushing it.  Looks down.  Walter's
             hearing aid.  Kicks it aside.

             INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
    
             Ellie.  In the front hall.  Following procedure.  Right hand
             gripping the gun.  Left supporting the butt.

             Blinks away sweat.  Facing three doorways.

             INT. DINING ROOM

             Will limps into the dining room.  Furniture stacked high.
             Eyes, darting.  Gun, covering.  Trying to stay conscious...

             BANG!  The screen door.

             INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

             Ellie.  Gun swinging.  Doorway one.  Doorway two.  Doorway 
             three...SUDDENLY

             A FIGURE

             runs past number one.  Big.  Shadowy.  The flash of a GUN.
             She wheels toward it.  Finger on the trigger...

             SLO-MO...The FIGURE, passing.  Her heart, POUNDING.  Her
             finger...squeezing...

             Will Dormer or Walter Byrd?

             At the last second, she jerks the gun away.  The figure 
             disappears.  She swallows.  Gripping the gun.  Follows.
  
             EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE

             The sky, heavy with clouds.  The air, foreboding.  Will
             steals out the screen door.  Gun cocked.  Eyes scanning.
             Wind, bending the weeds, the trees.

             BAM! a shot.  Out of nowhere.  Rips into his thigh.  Will
             CRIES out.  BAM! a second shot.  Whizzes past him...

             INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             ...CRACK! the shot bites into the window frame.  Wings Ellie
             halfway across the room.  She drops to the floor.  Clutching
             her shoulder.  Flesh wound.

                                 ELLIE
                       Shit!

             Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind
             it.  Notices

             A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges
             it open.  A flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long
             dark hair...

             EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE

             Will.  On the ground.  Gripping his leg.  Looking wildly
             around.  No sign of Walter.  Then.  He sees it.

             Lucy and Desi.  Down by the boathouse.

             INT. BOATHOUSE

             The boathouse.  Old, rotted wood.  Crumbling beams.

             Walter stands at a window.  Re-loading his shotgun.  He
             fumbles, drops a shell.  It rolls towards a crack in the
             floor.  Falls into the LAKE WATER below.

             CLICK!  Walter levels the shotgun out the window.

             WALTER'S POV - the long, undulating WEEDS outside.

             EXT. WEEDS
   
             Will.  Pulling himself through the weeds.  Losing blood fast.
             Dragging his body.  Approaches the side of the BOATHOUSE.

             WALTER'S GUN BARREL, sticking out.

             Will ducks his head.  Winces in pain.  Breathing, becoming
             ragged.  Rounds to the other side.  Hoists himself up to
             another WINDOW.  Cautiously looks in...

             WALTER at the far window.

             Will jerks back.  Steps on the dock.  A plank CREAKS.  Shit.
             Peers back through the window.  
    
             WALTER.  Still looking out.  Didn't hear a thing.

             Will remembers.  Walter doesn't have his hearing aid.  He's
             deaf on that side.

             INT. BOATHOUSE

             Walter, looking out the window.

             OVER HIS SHOULDER - we see Will climbing in through the
             window.  Smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg.
             Stands straight.  Levels his gun at Walter's back.

                                 WILL
                           (softly)
                       Walter?

             Nothing.  Walter continues staring out the window.  Will
             raises his voice.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Walter!

             Walter jumps, whips around.  Comes face to face with the 
             barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches
             his deaf ear.

                                 WALTER
                       Wild card.

                                 WILL
                       Drop the gun, Walter.

             Walter looks at Will's 45.

                                 WALTER
                       That jammed the last time, remember?

             The men LOCK EYES.  Wind HOWLING through the boathouse.
             Killer and Detective.  Only a bullet separating them.

             WALTER suddenly jerks up his shotgun...

             BANG!  He stumbles back.  Hit in the gut.

             Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking.  No longer jammed.

             Walter, touches the blood.  Looks back at Will.  Staggering.
             CRACK!  The rotting floor gives way beneath him.  He CRIES
             out, falls.  Drops into the icy water below.

             SILENCE.  Will steps over to the hole.  Looks down at
     
             WALTER, floating on his back.  Looking up at him.  Water
             washing over his body.  Eyes, pleading.  Fading.  A wave,
             gently pulls him away.

                                 WILL
                       Another J. Brody mystery.

             EXT. BOATHOUSE

             Will staggers out on to the dock.  Drops his gun.  Crashes to
             his knees.  Falls back.  His face, pale.  Lying against the
             wood of the dock.

             RAIN DROPS.  Start to fall.  Washing the blood from his skin.
             Puckering the lake water.  Will's eyes...flutter...

             FOOTSTEPS...running along the dock.  Heavy boots...

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                       Detective Dormer!

             Will squints against the rain.  Makes out the face of

             ELLIE hovering over him.  He gives a half-smile.

                                 WILL
                       God, you're a pain in the ass.

             Ellie kneels down next to him.  Pulls over her vest.  Covers
             him.

                                 ELLIE
                       You're shot.

             Will looks at her bloody shoulder.

                                 WILL
                       You, too.

             Ellie, tearing off her boot.  Yanks off her sock.

                                 ELLIE
                       I'm going to make a tourniquet.

             Will, fading fast.

                                 WILL
                       Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her
                       things are in the house.

                                 ELLIE
                       I know.

                                 WILL
                       Byrd's dead.

             Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  Starts twisting.  Will
             grimaces.  Ellie swallows.  Doesn't want to ask this.

                                 ELLIE
                       You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you?

             Will nods.

                                 WILL
                       Yes.

             A pained looks crosses Ellie's face.

                                 ELLIE
                       Did you mean to?

             Will shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                       No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.

                                 ELLIE
                       Why?

             RAIN, drumming down around them.  Will, takes a deep breath.

                                 WILL
                       Because I just couldn't be wrong.
                           (looks at her)
                       Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't 
                       ever lose your way.  It blurs the line.

             His blood, pumping out in rivulets.  Ellie looks down at him. 
             Her hero.  Moves up to the wound in his arm.

                                 ELLIE
                       This one looks worse.

             Will reaches up a feeble hand.  Stops her.

                                 WILL
                           (whispers)
                       Just let me sleep, Ellie...

             His eyelids, growing heavy.

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                       Let me sleep.

             Ellie blinks away the tears.  Knows what he means.  What he
             wants.  Watches as the calm spreads over him.

             Will closes his eyes.

                                 ELLIE
                       No!

             Will opens his eyes.  She ties the second sock around his
             arm.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I will not let you sleep.  If you've lost
                       your way then you have to make it right.
                       That's the only way.  That's what you'd
                       tell me.  I've been a detective for four
                       weeks and I say you're coming with me.

             She gets up.  Slips her arms under his shoulders.  Starts
             hoisting him up.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       C'mon...

             Will.  Struggling to his knees.  Every inch of him, screaming
             in pain.  Gets to his feet.  Arm slung around this tiny,
             young woman.

                                 WILL
                       What about your shoulder?

                                 ELLIE
                       Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

             And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.
                                                          
                                                                 FADE OUT.

                                         3/25/97

                

               BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT

               It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; 
               headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.

               It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- 
               a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with 
               it.

               We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative 
               sedan, whose occupant does not sing.

               INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE

               The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt 
               and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing 
               over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along 
               with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who 
               squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and 
               enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.

               ANOTHER EMPTY STREET

               The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and 
               approaches with its singing.

               REVERSE

               The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the 
               conservative sedan enters and recedes.

               BEACH

               We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, 
               squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a 
               halt.

               The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a 
               half-empty bottle of champagne.

               The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.

                                     MAN
                         Number Seven.

               She trots away.

               The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He 
               straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with 
               one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins 
               approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.

                                     MAN
                         Zing!

               MOTEL ROOM

               The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is 
               tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen.

               The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.

                                     MAN
                         Choo! Choo!...

               He looks around, in a closet, under the bed.

                                     MAN
                         I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash 
                         cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka 
                         burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my 
                         boiler and a fuh -- a fuh --

               He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the 
               window curtain.

               A salacious smiles spreads across his lips. He pulls on the 
               cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in 
               red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Tickets, please.

               The man is stripping off his clothes.

                                     MAN
                         Excuse me, Miss, is this the train 
                         to Ecsssstasy?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're 
                         comin' to a tunnel!

               Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed 
               just as --

               CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black 
               man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes 
               into the room with a video camera glued to his eye. He looks 
               like Clarence Thomas with a mustache.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!

               The young woman screams, clutching the sheets to her naked 
               bosom. Rex leaps from the bed, still clad only in his 
               chemindefer boxers, and darts around the room seeking egress.

               The man with the video charges around the room following Rex

               THE VIDEO IMAGE

               Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic, looking for his 
               clothing. The camera swish-pans back to the young woman still 
               screaming in the bed.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!!

               We swish-pan back to Rex as he bends over to pick up his 
               trousers, mooning us.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!

               PULL BACK FROM THE VIDEO IMAGE

               To reveal that we are in the detective -- Gus Petch's -- 
               office.

                                     GUS
                         I nailed his ass.

               Faintly, from the television monitor we hear screaming and 
               mayhem.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Trains...

               THE WOMAN

               Watching the monitor, MARYLIN REXROTH is a sensual beauty, 
               with intelligence and class. She watches the monitor without 
               expression.

                                     MARYLIN
                         ...I thought he'd outgrown trains.

               Gus Petch sits behind a desk.

                                     GUS
                         They never grow-up, lady. They just 
                         get tubby. Me, I've always had ample 
                         proportions. But it's all muscle -- 
                         I'm hard as a rock. I'm not on of 
                         these cream puff sit-behind-a desk 
                         private dicks; I'm an assnailer

                                     MARYLIN
                         So I see.

               Faintly, from the monitor:

                                     VOICE
                         I'm gonna nail your ass.

               We hear the Young Woman SQUEAL. Marylin reacts.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hard to believe that's the best he 
                         could do.

                                     GUS
                         Probably you're the best he could 
                         do.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh. Thank you.

                                     GUS
                         You're takin' it pretty well. I seen 
                         'em weep like they'd hired me to 
                         prove their husbands weren't fooling 
                         around. And I seen 'em celebrate. 
                         Like I just handed 'em a winning 
                         lottery ticket.

               Marylin turns her attention back to the screen.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm just enjoying the movie.

               TRACKING SHOT

               All from the perspective of a moving automobile.

               The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we 
               pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones 
               to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk 
               cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and 
               wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.

               THE DRIVER

               A handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular 
               phone. This is MILES MASSEY.

                                     MILES
                         -- hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah? 
                         Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look 
                         up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its 
                         relevance to the Chapman filing. She 
                         took the kids where? Tahoe? Which 
                         side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise 
                         goes all the way around the lake, 
                         she left the state and she's in 
                         breach. She can't leave the state. 
                         Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to 
                         attach everything. Primary residence, 
                         autos, stocks...
                              (Beat)
                         Sure. Put him through.
                              (Beat)
                         Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping 
                         with the nanny? Well, you're 
                         separated. She can sleep with -- is 
                         this the one you slept with? Oh. A 
                         guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm? 
                         Yes. I know you want her dead. 
                         Everyone in your tax bracket wants 
                         their ex wives dead.

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSE

               Rex is trying his key in the front door of his house. Finding 
               it doesn't, work he rattles the knob, then leans on the 
               doorbell.

               We hear distant chimes.

                                     REX
                         Honey! ...Honey?!

               Finally, through the intercom:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex. Get away from the door.

                                     REX
                         Look, Marylin, can't we have a 
                         civilized discussion about this?

                                     MARYLIN
                         We are. And it's winding down.

                                     REX
                         But Marylin, you know a divorce would 
                         ruin me right now. Everything I have -- 
                         everything we have -- is tied up in 
                         my business. The business is my entire 
                         life.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, 
                         Topeka and the Santa Fe?

                                     REX
                         Marylin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex. Go away. I don't want to have 
                         to sic the dogs on you.

                                     REX
                         Dogs?

               From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE 
               DOGS BARKING.

               LETTERING

               On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN & 
               GURALNICK.

               A pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a 
               receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Massey will be right with you.

               INT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.

                                     MILES
                         The problem is that everyone is 
                         willing to compromise. That's the 
                         problem with the institution of 
                         marriage -- it's based on compromise. 
                         Even through its dissolution. One 
                         attorney will try to score some 
                         points, the opposition will try to 
                         impeach. The process will find an 
                         equilibrium point determined by the 
                         skill of the opposing lawyers, and 
                         then each party will walk away with 
                         their portion of the "goodies." Some 
                         say, "Life is compromise." But at 
                         Massey Myerson we believe life is 
                         struggle and the ultimate destruction 
                         of your opponent.

               The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Your eleven o'clock is here.

                                     MILES
                         Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will 
                         continue this at the Associates 
                         Meeting next Friday. In the meantime, 
                         I want you to consider this... Ivan 
                         the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila 
                         the Hun -- what did they have in 
                         common?

               You may have seen it in the issue before last of "World of 
               Interiors." There's a Rothko on the wall, an Elle Bleu humidor 
               on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from 
               Yale.

                         your haven, your war room -- for the 
                         duration of the campaign.

                                     REX

                         Now Rex.

               He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, 
               makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest 
               concern.

                                     MILES
                         -- Tell me your troubles.

               Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.

                                     REX
                         Jeez. Where do I start?

               Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.

                                     REX
                         ...Well, my wife has me between a 
                         rock and a hard place.

                                     MILES
                         That's her job. You have to respect 
                         that.

                                     REX
                         When I first met Marylin -- Well, we 
                         were crazy about each other. Not 
                         emotionally, of course. We just 
                         couldn't keep our hands off each 
                         other.

                                     MILES
                         Mm.

                                     REX
                         But then... But then...

               Quietly.

                                     MILES
                         Time marches on. Ardor cools.

                                     REX
                         No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly 
                         cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And 
                         very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of 
                         it out there.

                                     MILES
                         Ah.

                                     REX
                         You know what I mean when I say "it."

                                     MILES
                         Gotcha. No need to get anatomically 
                         correct with me, Rex.

                                     REX
                         Seems like there's more of it than 
                         ever before --

                                     MILES
                         Well, with the expanding global 
                         population -- Let me ask you this -- 
                         your wife. Has she pursued the 
                         opportunities which must present 
                         themselves to the "knock-out, sexy 
                         woman" you described?

                                     REX
                         I don't know. I can assume...

                                     MILES
                         Not in court you can't. Has she 
                         retained counsel?

                                     REX
                         I'm not sure.

                                     MILES
                         And your wife is aware of or has 
                         evidence of your activities?

                                     REX
                         Video.

                                     MILES
                         Mmm... And to cut to the chase, 
                         forensically speaking -- is there a 
                         pre-nup?

               Rex hangs his head.

               Miles sighs sympathetically.

                                     MILES
                         The fault, dear Brutus, is not in 
                         our stars, but in ourselves. Well, 
                         let me ask you this: what kind of 
                         settlement do you seek? What are, 
                         for you, the parameters of the 
                         possible?

                                     REX
                         That's the problem. I can't afford 
                         to give her anything.

                                     MILES
                         Nothing?

                                     REX
                         I know that sounds rough but I'm 
                         about to close on a deal to develop 
                         some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged 
                         up to my ass. If this deal goes south, 
                         I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.

                                     MILES
                         So, you propose that in spite of 
                         demonstrable infidelity on your part, 
                         your unoffending wife should be tossed 
                         out on her ear?

                                     REX
                         Well -- is that possible?

               Miles smiles at him.

               EXT. RUNNING PATH - SAN VICENTE BLVD. - MORNING

               Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her 
               friends SARAH SORKIN and RAMONA BARCELONA. It's early, but 
               the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power 
               walkers, wheelchair racers etc. Ramona pushes her infant in 
               a baby jogger.

                                     SARAH
                         You want to come out to the beach 
                         house tomorrow?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I didn't know Barry had a beach house.

                                     SARAH
                         Neither did I until my lawyer found 
                         it -- quite a paper trail -- he had 
                         it in the dog's name.

                                     RAMONA
                              (To Marylin)
                         So who'd you hire?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ruth Rabino.

                                     SARAH
                         She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis 
                         or a Pearlman? She definitely did a 
                         Factor.

                                     MARYLIN
                         She did a Harriman.

                                     SARAH
                         Wow.

                                     MARYLIN
                         In the words of my Private 
                         Investigator, we're going to nail 
                         his ass.

                                     RAMONA
                         I've been trying to nail George's 
                         for years, but he's very careful. 
                         I'll just keep having children. I 
                         think I'm pregnant, by the way.

                                     SARAH
                         Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.

                                     RAMONA
                         Three is not Farrow.

                                     SARAH
                         Who's Rex's guy?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles Massey.

                                     SARAH
                         Of Massey Myerson?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you know him?

                                     SARAH
                         By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey 
                         that cute little island of George's.

                                     RAMONA
                         George was so impressed he hired him 
                         when he divorced his second.

                                     SARAH
                         Muriel Rumsey.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Who's she?

                                     SARAH
                         Now? She's a night manager at 
                         McDonalds.

                                     RAMONA
                         You should have tried to get pregnant 
                         Marylin -- solidify your position.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No.

                                     RAMONA
                         You like kids.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I can't have a baby with a man I 
                         don't love... And I can't submit a 
                         child to divorce.

                                     SARAH
                         It's not so bad these days. Kids 
                         like joint custody. Two sets of toys.

                                     RAMONA
                         Maybe next time.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Maybe.

                                     SARAH
                         We do have a man for you.

                                     RAMONA
                         Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just 
                         separated from his third. He's in 
                         fish. He is fish.

                                     SARAH
                         She's keeping his name. And one of 
                         his planes. And all seven of his 
                         children

                                     RAMONA
                         And only two are hers.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Please. I'm not seeing anyone until 
                         this is over. One husband at a time.

                                     SARAH
                         I wish I had your discipline.

               A COURTROOM

               We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in 
               her 60's.

                                     LAWYER
                         Mrs. Guttman, you have testified 
                         that you were your husband's sexual 
                         slave for thirty-six years, ever 
                         since you were married --

                                     WITNESS
                         Except for two years when he was in 
                         the Navy, in Korea.

                                     LAWYER
                         Prior to your marriage, what was 
                         your profession?

                                     WITNESS
                         I was a hostess. For Trans-World 
                         Airlines.

                                     LAWYER
                         What is your husband's profession?

                                     WITNESS
                         He manufactures staples and industrial 
                         brad-tacks. He's very successful.

               JUMP BACK

               At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice 
               lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate. 
               Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing 
               her testimony.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Wait... He wants to give her...?

                                     MILES
                         Nothing.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         And she has...?

                                     MILES
                         Video.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         What the fuck...?

               Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation. He gestures 
               to their surroundings.

                                     MILES
                         Wrigley!

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         Sometimes I have serious doubts about 
                         you.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I am very sorry.

                                     MILES
                         Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         No. You're not.

                                     MILES
                         I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer 
                         clerked for Scalia.

               Wrigley looks suicidal.

                                     BACKGROUND LAWYER (O.S.)
                         Couldn't you simply walk away from 
                         this abusive relationship?

                                     WOMAN
                         No, he had the videos...

                                     MILES
                         Anyway, I need a challenge. This --

               He waves dismissively at the courtroom.

                                     MILES
                         -- is not a challenge. I need 
                         something I can sink my teeth into, 
                         professionally speaking.

                                     WOMAN
                         He would invite these girls home 
                         from the staple factory to our 
                         condominium in Palm Springs. He had 
                         a device he called the Intruder.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have 
                         any questions for the complainant.

                                     MILES
                         I'm sorry, your honor, I was just 
                         conferring with my associate...

               He rises.

                                     MILES
                         Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know 
                         a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.

                                     MILES
                              (sadly)
                         Accountant.

               He reaches back and Wrigley puts a manila file in his hand.

                                     MILES
                         We would like to offer these 
                         photographs into evidence...

               WAITING ROOM - MASSEY MEYSERSON

               The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin 
               and her attorney Ruth Rabinow. Ruth is a sturdy woman in her 
               late 60's. If Mrs. Guttman had gone to law school...

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Massey will see you now.

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a 
               large fruit and pastry plate.

               The door swings open. Miles rises.

                                     MILES
                         ...Ruth!

               They shake hands.

                                     MILES
                         -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. 
                         And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     MARYLIN
                         And you must be Mr. Massey.

               They appraise each other for a beat. They are impressed and, 
               they are impressive. As they settle in:

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sadly)
                         Hello, Rex.

                                     REX
                         Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Are you alright? You lost weight.

                                     REX
                         My whole metabolism is -- off.

               Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and 
               smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.

                                     MILES
                         So, Ruth. How's Sam?

                                     RUTH
                         Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly 
                         fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.

                                     MILES
                         A yert.
                              (To Rex)
                         Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a 
                         time when most women are in Boca, 
                         having early bird specials -- she's 
                         working so her husband can be in 
                         Montana. In a yert.

                                     REX
                         What's a yert?

                                     RUTH
                              (Dryly)
                         I ran into your mother at the 
                         radiologist last week.

                                     MILES
                         What?!

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, just a routine mammogram. She 
                         said to say hello. She's going to 
                         Positano with your brother's family.

               A tight, terse smile from Miles.

                                     MILES
                         How nice.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Positano is beautiful. Remember when 
                         we were there, Rex? We stayed in the 
                         Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?

                                     REX
                         Yeah.

               They drift for a moment.

                                     RUTH
                         So, Miles. If you have a proposal, 
                         let's hear it.

                                     MILES
                         At this point my client is still 
                         prepared to consider reconciliation.

                                     RUTH
                         My client has ruled that out.

                                     MILES
                         My client is prepared to entertain 
                         an amicable dissolution of the 
                         marriage without prejudice.

                                     RUTH
                         That's delusional.

                                     MILES
                         My client proposes a thirty day 
                         cooling off period.

                                     RUTH
                         My client feels sufficiently 
                         dispassionate.

                                     MILES
                         My client asks that you not initiate 
                         proceedings pending his setting 
                         certain affairs in order.

                                     RUTH
                         Ha Ha.

                                     MILES
                              (conceding the point)
                         Heh heh.

                                     REX
                         What's so goddamn funny?

               Miles lays a hand on his arm.

                                     MILES
                         Please -- let me handle this.

               He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth.

                                     MILES
                         -- So much for the icebreakers. 
                         What're you after, Ruth?

                                     RUTH
                         My client is prepared to settle for 
                         fifty percent of the marital assets.

                                     MILES
                         Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why 
                         not ask for a hundred percent?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh brother. Here we go.

                                     MILES
                         Why not a hundred and fifty percent?

                                     RUTH
                         Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe 
                         we're being too conservative. Seventy 
                         five percent.

               Rex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and 
               whispers to him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you need a Tagamet?

                                     REX
                         You have some?

               She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with 
               several vials of prescription drugs.

                                     MARYLIN
                         These are yours.

                                     MILES
                         Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.

               She hands the pills to a grateful Rex. Their hands touch for 
               a moment.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Have you been taking your digestive 
                         enzymes?

                                     REX
                              (Contrite)
                         Sometimes I forget.

               She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth 
               watch the interaction.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To the attorneys)
                         I'm sorry. Where were we?

                                     RUTH
                         We were about to request the primary 
                         residence, and thirty percent of the 
                         remaining assets.

                                     MILES
                         Are you familiar with Kirshner?

                                     RUTH
                         Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner 
                         was in Kentucky.

                                     REX
                         What's Kirshner?

                                     MILES
                         Please -- let me handle this. Okay, 
                         Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your 
                         bottom line?

                                     RUTH
                         The primary residence and FORTY 
                         percent of the remaining assets. 
                         You're becoming tedious Miles.

                                     REX
                         Aren't we going in the wrong 
                         direction?

                                     MILES
                         Shhh. Please. Let me do my job.
                              (To Ruth)
                         Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten 
                         about Kirshner?

               Ruth stands and closes her attaché case.

                                     RUTH
                         See you at the preliminary.

               Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.

                                     MILES
                         Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.

               Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin 
               following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a 
               smile.

               Rex swallows two more tablets. He sits, looking despondent.

                                     MILES
                         I think that went as well as could 
                         be expected.

                                     REX
                         She always looked out for me.

                                     MILES
                         And she had private investigators 
                         assisting her.

                                     REX
                              (Sentimental)
                         She brought my digestive enzymes.

                                     MILES
                         In anticipation of making you sick.

                                     REX
                         Maybe I should reconsider my...

               Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.

                                     MILES
                         A superficial display of marital 
                         solicitude, and you lose your resolve? 
                         Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm 
                         your attorney, and if you choose to 
                         reward her for that mediocre charade 
                         of spousal concern...

               He shrugs, helplessly.

                                     REX
                         You're right. Screw her.

               INT. GYM - CLOSE ON

               A woman walking across a gymnasium floor. Suddenly, she's 
               assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant. His sweats 
               barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature. On his 
               head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet. He 
               grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him. She reacts 
               swiftly. With a ferocious "NO," she stomps on his foot, and 
               smashes him in the face. The mugger raises his hands in a 
               gesture of submission.

               APPLAUSE

               We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class. 
               Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all 
               wearing T-shirts with the words IMPACT-Personal Safety. 
               Marylin and Sarah sit against the wall.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't know what his game is. He 
                         dismissed every one of Ruth's 
                         proposals. And Sarah, we weren't 
                         unreasonable.

                                     SARAH
                         Well what does he want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, 
                         but I could tell she was surprised.

                                     SARAH
                         He has a reputation for being tough.

               Marylin watches as a new "victim" begin her walk across the 
               gym.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Grinning)
                         Lilly's up.

                                     SARAH
                         Oh, God!

               The mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward 
               the "victim." She glances over her shoulder, and at the sight 
               of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the 
               exit. Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from 
               the other students force them to affect concerned looks.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Whispers)
                         Every week --

                                     SARAH
                         I'm dying.

               The two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing 
               woman back into the room. They clasp her in an empathic group 
               hug.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by 
                         his intransigence. If I didn't know 
                         better, I'd swear Massey had some 
                         personal investment in my ruination.

                                     SARAH
                         So where are you now?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, if he continues to maintain 
                         this position -- we're in court.

                                     SARAH
                         Shit.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Get this! He called and invited me 
                         to dinner.

               The INSTRUCTOR, a vivacious phys ed major, approaches Marylin.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Marylin? Ready.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.

               Marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing 
               the traumatized Lilly.

                                     SARAH
                         That's completely odd.

               Marylin begins the Victim walk. The Mugger quickly moves up 
               from the rear.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Sarah)
                         I know. That's why I accepted. Find 
                         out what's up with this clown.

               The Mugger is upon her. He grabs her hair. She stomps his 
               foot, and smoothly wheels around SMASHING him in the nose 
               with her elbow, while KNEEING HIM in the groin.

               The women Cheer.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         That was excellent, Marylin. But you 
                         forgot to yell "no."

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ah.
                              (Calmly, to the Mugger)
                         No.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEGANT RESTAURANT - EVENING

               Miles rises from his seat as Marylin enters.

                                     MILES
                         Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming.

               The Maitre d' is pulling out a chair for her.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I have to admit. I was curious. And 
                         hungry.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Something to start? Some wine, 
                         perhaps?

               Miles glances at the wine list.

                                     MILES
                         French?
                              (She smiles)
                         Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.

               Miles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I assume this is on Rex?

                                     MILES
                         Isn't everything?

               Miles regards her.

                                     MILES
                         Your husband told me you were 
                         beautiful, but I was unprepared.

                                     MARYLIN
                         "Dismiss your vows, your feigned 
                         tears, your flattery, for where a 
                         heart is hard, they make no battery."

               Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and considers 
               her.

                                     MILES
                         Simon & Garfunkel?

               She laughs.

                                     MILES
                         Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Did you see the tape?

                                     MILES
                         Not yet.

                                     MARYLIN
                         See the tape. Then we can discuss my 
                         heart.

               A waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips 
               and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your 
                         performance about this afternoon?

                                     MILES
                         What does your lawyer think?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ruth says you've been too successful, 
                         that you're bored, complacent, and 
                         you're on your way down.

                                     MILES
                         But you don't agree?

                                     MARYLIN
                         How do you know?

                                     MILES
                         Why would you be here?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I told you. I was hungry.

               FLAP a menu enters frame. It is handed to Marylin; another 
               is handed to Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I'll have the tournedos of beef. And 
                         the lady will have the same?
                              (To Marylin)
                         I assume you're a carnivore.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know you do.

               She addresses the waiter.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Risotto with white truffles, please.

               Miles looks at her with appreciation.

                                     MILES
                         "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at 
                         first sight?"

                                     MARYLIN
                         You didn't ask me here to pick me 
                         up. You could get in trouble for 
                         that.

                                     MILES
                         Not really. You're not my client. 
                         Freedom of association. Big issue 
                         with the First Amendment fans. Want 
                         to go to Hawaii for the weekend?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Have you ever been married, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't believe in it.

                                     MILES
                         As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You just haven't met the right person.

                                     MILES
                         No. I haven't. Have you?

               She regards him for a moment.

                                     MARYLIN
                         All right, Miles. Let me tell you 
                         everything you THINK you know. I was 
                         married to Rex for a long time. I 
                         was an excellent wife, a partner, a 
                         lover, a hostess and a friend. There 
                         was only one thing I did wrong during 
                         the five years we were together. I 
                         got five years older. Think he should 
                         be able to ditch me for that?

                                     MILES
                         He wants a reconciliation.

                                     MARYLIN
                         See the tape. Then we can discuss 
                         reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I 
                         nailed his ass. Now I'm going to 
                         have it mounted and have my 
                         girlfriends over to throw darts at 
                         it. Then I'm getting on with my life. 
                         That's all I'm after.

                                     MILES
                         Gotcha.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What is it you're after, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking 
                         for an ass to mount.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, don't look at mine!

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oyez. Oyez. Family court for the 
                         fifth district of Los Angeles County 
                         is now in session.

               COURT ROOM

               A large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters 
               from behind the Solomonic Platform.

                                     CLERK
                         -- The Honorable Marva Munson 
                         presiding. All rise.

               Massey, Wrigley, and Rex Rexroth in between, rise. Rex and 
               Wrigley remain respectfully standing, facing forward, as 
               they whisper out of the side of their mouths:

                                     REX
                         Have you sat before her before?

               Wrigley considers.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         -- the judge sits. We argue. We argue 
                         before her. She sits before us.

                                     REX
                         Okay. Has she sat before you before?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         You can't sit before her. That's the 
                         rule! She sits before we argue!

               Miles glances over and hisses:

                                     MILES
                         Shut! Up!

               A GAVEL CRASHES

               LATER

               We are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they 
               sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated 
               by a flickering TV monitor.

               Leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint:

                                     VOICE
                         I'm gonna nail your ass.

               The track ends over at Marylin's table, where Marylin also 
               wearing headphones, looks on with studied stoicism. Ruth 
               lays a consoling hand on her shoulder.

               LATER

               Marylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on 
               the witness stand. She is modestly dressed and her attitude 
               is one of shocked, wounded innocence.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I was devastated. Of course.

                                     RUTH
                         Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey, any questions?

               Miles soberly rises.

                                     MILES
                         Mmmm --

               He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be 
               lost in thought.

               Marylin watches him.

               Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:

                                     MILES
                         "Dismiss your vows, your feigned 
                         tears, your flattery, for where a 
                         heart is hard, they make no 
                         battery..."

               Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled 
               irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a 
               faint smile.

                                     MILES
                         Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?

               Marylin examines him with guarded eyes. Ruth sensing something 
               unscripted going on, tries to cut it off.

                                     RUTH
                         Objection, your honor!

                                     JUDGE
                         Grounds?

                                     RUTH
                         Uh... poetry recitation.

                                     MILES
                         Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how 
                         high is that wall around your heart?

               Marylin eyes him suspiciously.

                                     RUTH
                         Your honor, this is harassment! Arid 
                         frankly it's still a little...

               She flutters one hand.

                                     RUTH
                         ...arty farty!

                                     MILES
                         Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you 
                         ever been in love?

               Marylin hesitates, gives a "what does this mean look" to 
               Ruth. She returns a "beats me."

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.

                                     MILES
                         And you've always loved him?

               Smiles slips out:

                                     MARYLIN
                         "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at 
                         first sight?"

               Miles returns a fleeting smile.

                                     MILES
                         And you hoped to spend the rest of 
                         your life with him?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. Why is that so difficult for 
                         you to understand?

               She looks at Rex with tender sorrow.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex was -- is -- a very appealing 
                         man. I am sorry I couldn't...
                              (Tearing up)
                         I tried my best.

               Miles almost smiles. She's good.

                                     MILES
                         That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please 
                         forgive me for causing you additional 
                         anguish.
                              (To the Judge)
                         Thank you, Your Honor. No further 
                         questions.

               A Bailiff offers to help Marylin off the stand. She politely 
               and courageously declines.

                                     JUDGE
                         Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.

                                     RUTH
                         We rest, Your Honor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey?

                                     MILES
                         Yes, Your honor. I call Patricia 
                         Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.

               Marylin, in the process of reseating herself behind her table, 
               pauses.

               Ruth notices this and leans in.

                                     RUTH
                         Who's that?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Jesus.

               An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn. 
               She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's not 
               taking it well. She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic. She 
               speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently for 
               no apparent reason.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Mrs. Isenberg.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Banderas.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear 
                         that the testimony you are about to 
                         give shall be the truth, the whole 
                         truth, and nothing but the truth so 
                         help you God?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do.

                                     MILES
                         Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your 
                         relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     PATRICIA
                         We don't have much of a relationship 
                         anymore. I haven't seen her since 
                         before she married Rex. We had some 
                         very nice times prior to that. We 
                         were quite close.

                                     RUTH
                              (To Marylin)
                         Is this a lover?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Please!

                                     MILES
                         And how would you define your 
                         relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You 
                         know -- you are her...?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Mother?

                                     RUTH
                         What?!

               Marylin sighs.

                                     MILES
                         Her Mother?

               Patricia smiles coyly. Gives Marylin a silly little wave by 
               way of greeting.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Hi, Sweetie.

                                     MILES
                         Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you 
                         are frequently mistaken for sisters.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Mumbles)
                         He'll regret this.

                                     MILES
                         Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?

                                     PATRICIA
                         No. I haven't. But I've been out of 
                         town.
                              (Little girlish wave)
                         Hello, Rex. Hello there.

                                     MILES
                         You were never invited to meet your 
                         son-in-law?

                                     PATRICIA
                         No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? 
                         No. Well... no.

                                     RUTH
                         Objection, Your Honor. This isn't 
                         about Mrs. Rexroth's filial 
                         obligations.

                                     JUDGE
                         Sustained.

                                     MILES
                         Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Of course. Of course she was married. 
                         What else would she be? Single? I 
                         don't think so.

               She laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her 
               psyche.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Let me tell you something about Patty.

                                     MILES
                         Who's "Patty."

                                     PATRICIA
                         Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like 
                         mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. 
                         But she changed it after seeing "Some 
                         Like It Hot." To Marylin. After 
                         Marylin Monroe.

                                     MILES
                         I see. And what were you going to 
                         tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

                                     PATRICIA
                         When she was a tiny girl? And people 
                         asked her what she wanted to be when 
                         she grew up? She never said the usual 
                         things little girls say -- like -- 
                         nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? 
                         She always said --
                              (Very Shirley Temple)
                         "When I grow up, I want to be 
                         divorced."

               She laughs happily at the memory.

                                     MILES
                         Divorce was her childhood aspiration?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Well, not just divorce. She used to 
                         say "I want to be divorced from some 
                         big dumb rich guy..." And I guess 
                         her dream is coming true.
                              (To Marylin)
                         I'm happy for you Patty

               Pasta being cooked. Salad being tossed. Wine glasses are

                         It was like that scene in The 
                         Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is 
                         called to testify against the Family. 
                         And he's in court, and he looks into 
                         the spectators gallery, and sees his 
                         Brother. They brought the brother 
                         from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a 
                         word. He can't testify. That's what 
                         it was like seeing Pat in there. I 
                         couldn't even have Ruth cross examine 
                         her.

                         Why do you think she did it?

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Shrugs)
                         Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. 
                         Maybe they offered her money. Massey 
                         is very seductive. Who knows.

                                     RAMONA
                         Maybe they put a horse head in her 
                         bed?

                                     SARAH
                         That stinks. They left you with 
                         absolutely nothing. It makes you 
                         wonder about the entire legal system. 
                         Like Rodney King.

                                     MARYLIN
                         They bought her speech. If I was 
                         only in it for Rex's money, he 
                         shouldn't have to give me any.

                                     RAMONA
                         That doesn't make sense. It's like 
                         punishing you for being goal oriented.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, you can live here as long as 
                         you want. Do you have any plans?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Nothing specific, but I'll have my 
                         own place soon.

                                     SARAH
                         So, Marylin. Is that what you said 
                         when you were a little girl?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Probably. Every woman in my life was 
                         divorced at least twice. What was I 
                         supposed to say. Anthropologist?

                                     RAMONA
                         I begged you to have a baby!

                                     MARYLIN
                         In the Godfather, after the courtroom 
                         scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his 
                         veins in the bathtub.

                                     SARAH
                         You're not...

                                     MARYLIN
                         No. I'll see some blood before this 
                         is over, but it won't be mine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Miles is at his weekly chess game with his college friend, 
               DR. KENNETH BECK, a disaffected plastic surgeon. Miles, Cohiba 
               in hand, studies the board. Dr. Ken sips his Merlot. Moves a 
               piece.

                         So. I won't be seeing her? Your 
                         clients usually visit me after the 
                         settlement.

                                     MILES
                         Not this one. Not unless her HMO 
                         covers plastic surgery, which, 
                         incidentally, she does not need.

                                     KENNETH
                         Everyone needs plastic surgery. You 
                         need it.

                                     MILES
                         I don't need it.

                                     MILES
                         What the hell is Botox?

                                     KENNETH
                         It's a form of botulism. I just inject 
                         it into your forehead, and it 
                         paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't 
                         raise them...

                                     MILES
                         Why in God's name would I want...?

                                     KENNETH
                         No frown lines.

                         New watch?

                         It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can 
                         flip the face, and set it for two 
                         time zones.

                                     KENNETH
                         Why would you need two time zones? 
                         You never leave Beverly Hills.

                                     MILES
                         It was a gift from a client.

                         Botox. Christ. We had aspirations 
                         when we were in college.

                                     KENNETH
                         We did not.

                                     MILES
                         You were going to be a Cardiac 
                         Surgeon. I was going to clerk for 
                         the Supreme Court.

                                     KENNETH
                         I was going to play golf. You were 
                         going to have Asian girlfriends.

                                     MILES
                         Denial is not a river in Egypt.

               Kenneth moves a chess piece.

                         You're in check.

                                     MILES
                         I should be in therapy.

               INT. MILES MASSEY'S OFFICE

               Miles addresses BONNIE DONOVAN, a client.

                                     MILES
                         Yes. Your husband did show remarkable 
                         foresight in taking those pictures. 
                         And, yes, absent a swimming pool, 
                         the presence of the pool man would 
                         appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, 
                         who is the real victim here? Let me 
                         suggest the following. Your husband, 
                         who on a prior occasion slapped you -- 
                         beat you --

                         Your husband, who has beaten you --

                         So he says now! But if not for your 
                         cool headed intervention, his tantrum 
                         might have ended this schmoe's life 
                         and ruined his own... As for the 
                         sexual indiscretion which he imagined 
                         had taken place, wasn't it in fact 
                         he who had been sleeping with the 
                         pool man?

               He stares contemplatively at the ceiling and, after a beat, 
               responds to the silence:

                                     MILES
                         Am I going to far here?

               Slatted shades are drawn against the sun. It is dim, gloomy. 
               We can just make out the shape of an ancient man -- small, 
               hunched -- seated behind an enormous desk. A gallows shape 
               next to him is hard to make out; it is tall, rail thin and 
               fixed with a swinging, glinting appendage.

               A voice -- old, dry, rasping, lightly accented of a long-
               gone Brooklyn boyhood -- seems disembodied and sourceless, 
               as if it is the voice of the gloom itself.

               He leans back in his chair, breathing heavily, and runs a 
               tongue over his sandpapery lips. He is wearing oversize Swifty-

               He clears his throat, begins again with lower pitch, suave

               On Miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin, what a pleas -- who the 
                         fuck are you?

               Facing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle 
               aged man in a business suit.

               Just behind him is Marylin Rexroth, looking as coolly 
               beautiful as ever. She smoothly puts in:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles, how nice of you to see us -- 
                         may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of 
                         Doyle Oil.

                                     DOYLE
                         I told you we know each other, baby. 
                         Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother-
                         in law. Martin Reiser?

                                     MILES
                         Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?

                                     DOYLE
                              (To Marylin)
                         After you, Doll.

               Marylin glides into the office. Seats herself on the couch. 
               Doyle sits next to her, one proprietary hand on her knee.

                                     MILES
                         And how is Mrs. Reiser?

                                     DOYLE
                         Few suicide attempts, little inpatient 
                         stint. Naturally, she misses her 
                         kids. Six weekends a year and 
                         alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh 
                         to us but -- hey -- all's fair. 
                         Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," 
                         takes her meds and goes to 
                         occupational therapy at a local 
                         sheltered workshop.

                                     MILES
                         So she's uh, flourishing?

                                     DOYLE
                         She makes felt wallets. Got one right 
                         here.

               Doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with money.

               Most of the contents slip to the floor.

                                     DOYLE
                         Yeah. I know. Leather would be more 
                         practical, but whatcha gonna do?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles, I know you're busy and that 
                         you charge by the hour so I'll come 
                         to the point. Howard and I are 
                         planning to marry.

               Miles is stunned.

                                     MILES
                         Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?

                                     DOYLE
                         Yep. My divorce just came through. 
                         Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a 
                         better deal! My wife still has health 
                         insurance and gets to see the 
                         children. But, I don't know. Guess 
                         I'm just a softie. After all Amanda 
                         and me were together for -- what -- 
                         you'd know better than me, Marylin. 
                         She was your best friend.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Thinks)
                         Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen 
                         and Mandy must be what -- twelve?

                                     DOYLE
                              (To Miles)
                         Here. Got pictures.

               He removes a family photo from the felt wallet. It's of Howard 
               and two fat teenagers. Apparently the former Mrs. Doyle was 
               cut out, but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in 
               the shot.

                                     MILES
                         I... uh guess congratulations are in 
                         order.

                                     DOYLE
                         Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up 
                         and...

                                     MARYLIN
                         Honey, I don't think this is really 
                         relevant to...

                                     DOYLE
                         ...and one day, this sweet girl calls 
                         me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder 
                         to cry on deal. One thing leads to 
                         another and before I know it --

                                     MARYLIN
                         -- we realized we'd always been very 
                         attracted to one another.

                                     MILES
                         No!

                                     DOYLE
                         I had no idea until after, but --

               He looks at her with predatory lust.

                                     DOYLE
                         Baby. You are so HOT!

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Coy)
                         Howard!

               He pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her.

                                     MILES
                         What a touching story.

                                     DOYLE
                         You know, Miles, after my wife -- 
                         wife's mastectomy -- things were 
                         never the same. This might sound 
                         cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, 
                         but...
                              (man to man)
                         I like my women with two boobs.

               Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she 
               assiduously avoids eye contact.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Howard and I are here, Miles, because 
                         I have learned through bitter 
                         experience that when it comes to 
                         matrimonial law, you are the very 
                         best.

               Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.

                                     MARYLIN
                         As you are well aware, my previous 
                         marriage ended with an unjustified 
                         strain on my reputation My motives 
                         were questioned. I was slandered in 
                         court.

                                     DOYLE
                         You did good, Massey!

                                     MARYLIN
                         Therefore in an effort to remove any 
                         trace of suspicion from my sweet 
                         Howard -- I wish to execute a pre-
                         nuptial agreement.

                                     DOYLE
                         And -- there's no talking her out of 
                         it. Believe me, I've tried.

                                     MARYLIN
                         They say the Massey pre-nup has never 
                         been penetrated.

                                     DOYLE
                         She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.

               He gropes her. She giggles like a teenager.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, for the love of...

                                     MARYLIN
                         That is true, isn't it Miles? Your 
                         pre-nup is the best there is?

                                     MILES
                         That is correct. Not to blow my own 
                         horn, but they devote an entire 
                         semester to it at Harvard Law.

                                     DOYLE
                         Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!

                                     MILES
                         I just want to make sure that you 
                         both --

               He eyes Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         -- understand what you're asking for 
                         here. The Massey pre-nup provides 
                         that in the event of a dissolution 
                         of the marriage for any reason, both 
                         parties shall leave it with whatever 
                         they brought in, and earned during. 
                         No one can profit from the marriage. 
                         The pre-nup protects the wealthier 
                         party.

                                     DOYLE
                         Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.

                                     MILES
                         And without it, that party is exposed -- 
                         a sitting duck. No wriggle room.

                                     DOYLE
                         A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put 
                         that in the Malibu house. Screw the 
                         screening room!

                                     MILES
                              (slightly sickened)
                         -- and we are sure...

               Eyes boring into Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         -- we are both sure that's what we 
                         want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Absolutely.

                                     DOYLE
                         Course I can't do much "wriggling" 
                         if you tie me up like that again. 
                         Massey -- this is one bad bad little 
                         girl.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (laughing)
                         We'd better go before we get thrown 
                         out.

               ELEVATOR BANK

               Marylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out 
               to catch them.

                                     MILES
                         Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could 
                         just borrow your charming fiancee 
                         for a moment.

                                     DOYLE
                         What part?

                                     MILES
                         I'd just like to have a word with 
                         her.

                                     DOYLE
                         Why not? I'm going to have her for a 
                         lifetime.

               Miles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pager.

                                     MILES
                         What are you doing?

               She backs up as he tries to close the space between them.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Getting married.

                                     MILES
                         To him? He's a sick freak.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He's passionate.

                                     MILES
                         Passionate! He's a pervert. He should 
                         have to register when he moves.

                                     MARYLIN
                         All girls enjoy a little rough trade 
                         from time to time.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! Listen to me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No. You listen to me.
                              (Very quiet and 
                              deliberate)
                         You busted me, Miles. You left me 
                         with nothing! What did you expect me 
                         to do? Get a degree in counseling? 
                         Write a book about table linen? 
                         Because that's what wives do when 
                         they get dumped, and frankly, I'm 
                         not quite ready for that.

                                     MILES
                         But why him?

                                     MARYLIN
                         We told you. We realized we've always 
                         been in love.

               He has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters 
               a flowering ficus.

                                     MILES
                         The Massey pre-nup has never been 
                         pene -- successfully challenged.

                                     MARYLIN
                         So I hear. Is that all?

                                     MILES
                         No, that's not all.

               He moves to kiss her.

                                     MILES
                         You fascinate me.

               She deftly slides out of the way. Miles watches her as she 
               heads down the hall. As she gets on the elevator, Howard 
               grabs her butt with one hand, while giving Miles a high sign 
               with the other.

               INT. HOWARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Miles stares at the chessboard.

                                     MILES
                         Do you think I'm going to end up 
                         like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy 
                         bag instead of a family?

                                     KENNETH
                         Got any symptoms?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. The inability to experience 
                         pleasure.

                                     KENNETH
                         Oh. That.
                              (beat)
                         Don't waste time with your queen.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     KENNETH
                         The Center Counter Defense. The thing 
                         is not to move your queen too early.

                                     MILES
                         She can't really love that idiot, 
                         can she?

                                     KENNETH
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         Marylin Rexroth. She came into my 
                         office and signed a pre-nup with 
                         Howard Doyle.

                                     KENNETH
                         Doyle Oil?
                              (Miles nods)
                         A Massey Pre-nup?
                              (Miles nods again)
                         She loves him.

                                     MILES
                         He's the wrong man.

                                     KENNETH
                         Miles! Don't waste time with someone 
                         else's queen, either.

               EXT. A WEDDING BOWER - AKA CHUPPA

               From behind the bower, RABBI BOLENSKY emerges, strumming his 
               guitar and singing:

                                     BOLENSKY
                         Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme -- 
                         Remember me to one who lives there...

               A pullback reveals Howard D. Doyle before the altar with 
               Marylin. He is in a tuxedo and yarmulke. She is dressed in a 
               simple, Kennedy-type gown.

                                     BOLENSKY
                         -- she once was a true love of mine.

               The last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone 
               sits.

               As Miles and Wrigley seat themselves, Wrigley is sniffling.

               Miles is irritated.

                                     MILES
                         What the hell is wrong with you?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I can't help it. Even with the 
                         business we're in, I -- it gets me 
                         every time. It's so -- optimistic.

                                     MILES
                         Is she going through with it?

               As the crowd quiets with the end of the song, Wrigley murmurs:

                                     WRIGLEY
                         If she's not going through with it, 
                         she's cutting it awful close.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme. 
                         Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients 
                         for the banquet we call -- life. 
                         Marriage is like a Great Feast. 
                         Courtship is the Appetizer. A small 
                         mixed green taste of things to come. 
                         The Early Years -- The First Course -- 
                         a carefully poached fish dish 
                         dependent on freshness and delicate 
                         handling. Or perhaps a light pasta -- 
                         a tortellini stuffed with cheese and 
                         hope.

                                     WRIGLEY
                              (Whispers, to Miles)
                         You have any gum or mints?

                                     RABBI
                         The main course -- Mature Love -- a 
                         hearty stew, cooked slowly in the 
                         oven of companionship until the meat 
                         falls off the bone. And then -- 
                         dessert. The reward for years spent 
                         together -- the sweetness of a Life 
                         Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren, 
                         followed by the decafe demitasse of 
                         retirement.

               There is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and 
               the restlessness of a hungry audience.

               Finally:

                                     RABBI BOLENKSY
                         Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin 
                         to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang 
                         though the lean years as well as 
                         those that are heavily marbled?

                                     DOYLE
                         I do.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take 
                         Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel? 
                         The stock in your sauce?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do.

                                     MILES
                         Argh.

               Heads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         Then, by the power vested in me by 
                         the state of California, and as the 
                         maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star 
                         Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce 
                         you -- man and wife...

               A kiss. Cheers. Applause.

               A RECEPTION ON THE GROUNDS

               Rabbi Bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping 
               platter of smoked salmon.

               Miles is darkly brooding as Wrigley opens a Tiffany box to 
               show him the contents.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         What are they?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Berry spoons.

                                     MILES
                         Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm 
                         surprised at you. What is this? Some 
                         Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are 
                         the most cockamamie things I've ever --

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Miles -- why so angry?

               Miles sounds wistful:

                                     MILES
                         Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?

               Ding Ding -- Howard D. is tapping a knife against his wine 
               glass. The crowd quiets.

                                     DOYLE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: 
                         I have something to say to my bride.

               Howard D. turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one 
               of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him.

                                     DOYLE
                         -- Darling, like the rabbi said... 
                         life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe, 
                         and Marylin, darling... I just want 
                         you to know that I am IN the kitchen 
                         and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!

               Laughter from the gallery.

                                     DOYLE
                         And I'm going to start this marriage 
                         by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot 
                         hors d'oerve of this love story is -- 
                         Pre-nup Primavera!

               He reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of 
               paper.

                                     DOYLE
                         Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!

               A Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of 
               Doyle. Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused.

                                     DOYLE
                         -- This is for you, darling.

               He starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping 
               them into the sauce, and eating them. His mouth stuffed with 
               paper, Doyle repeats:

                                     DOYLE
                         -- this is for you, Darling.

               The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a 
               smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild 
               cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand 
               together, nodding comprehension.

                                     MILES
                         Brilliant.

               Next to him Wrigley is puzzled.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Why is he doing that?

               Miles' hand-clapping accelerates.

                                     MILES
                         Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating 
                         the pre-nup.

               Wrigley's eyes widen. He looks back at Doyle eating the paper.

                                     DOYLE
                         This is for you, Darling!

               Wrigley bursts into tears.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         That's -- the most romantic thing 
                         I've ever seen -- in my LIFE!

                                     DOYLE
                         THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!

               LATER

               Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations.

               Miles approaches and draws her aside.

                                     MILES
                         I'd like to offer my congratulations. 
                         That was a beautiful gesture of 
                         Howard's.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Howard is a beautiful person.

                                     MILES
                         Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. 
                         And I have a feeling that someday 
                         soon you'll be taking that diamond 
                         and leaving the rough.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. Miles. Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I am thrilled for you, but tell me 
                         this... How'd you get Howard to do 
                         it? I've addressed enough juries to 
                         appreciate the power of suggestion, 
                         but it seemed like he thought it was 
                         his own idea.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It was his idea. It was a gesture of 
                         love and trust. Be happy for me, 
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Well, when this goes south -- promise 
                         you'll have dinner with me?

                                     MARYLIN
                              (She holds a plate of 
                              food for him)
                         Have you tried the duck?

                                     MILES
                         I figure a couple of months. That's 
                         how long it should take for the ink 
                         on the settlement to dry.

               He takes the plate of food from her.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It has bones. Be sure to swallow 
                         one.

                                     MILES
                         Although knowing you as I do -- there 
                         will be no settlement. This time it 
                         will be complete and total 
                         annihilation.

               INT. LEAR JET COCKPIT

               A uniformed pilot and copilot are cruising the corporate jet 
               high above a vast ocean of clouds. The pilot is wearing a 
               headset. After a long moment of listening he shakes his head.

                                     PILOT
                         Jesus --

                         What --?

                                     PILOT
                         -- I've heard some -- I've heard 
                         some sick things -- in my --

                         What?!

               The pilot reaches above his head and throws a small toggle 
               switch and the cockpit is Awash with the sound of screaming, 
               laughter and music:

                                     MALE VOICE
                         Oh Casey Jones was the rounder's

                         to fame!

               INT. CABIN OF LEAR JET

               Screaming with laughter, two naked damsels in conductor's 
               caps are pushing Rex Rexroth around the cabin on a miniature 
               locomotive. He is wearing his railroad boxers and bellowing 
               "The Ballad of Casey Jones."

               BACK TO THE COCKPIT

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Who is that guy?

                                     PILOT
                         Rex Rexroth, the mini-mall king. 
                         Getting to be the richest man on the 
                         West Coast, from what they say.

               The copilot shakes his head.

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Jesus.

                         Why're they going to Muncie?

               The pilot shrugs.

                                     PILOT
                         He's thinking of buying Indiana.

               Wrigley enters.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I'm sorry I'm late. I was having 
                         lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. 
                         Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is 
                         divorced!

                                     MILES
                              (Delighted)
                         HA!

                         ...and I hear she's richer than

                         Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. 
                         Croesus?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         She could buy and sell you ten times 
                         over.

                                     MILES
                         She deserves every penny. They pay 
                         great athletes a fortune. Well, 
                         Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the 
                         peak of her power.

               He hits the call button.

                         Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.

                         I'd stay away from her, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I know you would, Wrigley. But would

               We move in on one of the tables where Marylin and Miles sit

                         I don't feel victorious Miles. I 
                         feel betrayed, abandoned and 
                         humiliated. I have pictures of him 
                         with another woman...

                         can open an erotic art gallery.

                         Did you invite me here to score some 
                         cheap laughs.

                                     MILES
                         No. Just to comfort you, and 
                         appreciate you --

                              (Reproachfully)
                         You really think I engineered the 
                         whole thing. You think the marriage 
                         and the divorce was part of some 
                         scheme. You came here to celebrate 
                         because you think I'm without morality 
                         or soul. You --
                              (With difficulty)
                         sound like my mother.

               The Waiter hands Miles a menu.

                         Should we order?

                         Yes, I -- well, I'm not really...

                                     MILES
                         Not hungry, huh? Neither am I.

               A long pensive moment.

               Miles reaches across the table and takes her hand. She lets 
               him. He strokes it.

               INT. CAR

               Miles drives. Marylin sits silently looking out the window.

               DOYLE MANSION

               Miles pulls up to the huge house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Thank you. And good-night.

               He takes her hand again.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin --

               She puts a finger to his lips.

               Sadly, Miles relinquishes her hand.

               She exits the car and walks up to the front door. Miles 
               watches her go.

               INT. BEDROOM - MASSEY MANSION

               We hear Court TV on in the background. Miles alone in bed,

               The woozy track finds the cadaverous hand at the end of the 
               arm with an IV tube swinging from it. Miles stands next to 
               the arm. He's holding an assault type weapon.

               He bolts up in bed, sweating.

               RING

               He gazes stuporously about, reaching for the ringing phone.

                         You're right about me. I am worthless. 
                         I am nothing. I don't deserve to 
                         live.

                         Marylin? When did I say...?

                         I don't blame them for betraying me. 
                         I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my

                         you may or may not know. I suck!

               We hear the SCREECH of Tires.

                              (Scream)
                         You get out of the car. That's right, 
                         Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!

                                     MILES
                         You shouldn't be driving. Where are 
                         you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills 
                         hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in 
                         the Polo...?

                                     MILES
                         I live right near there. The 800 
                         Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- 
                         come here right now before -- just 
                         come here.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and 
                         pick up a blended for --

                                     MILES
                         No. Don't stop.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Okay Miles.

               INT. DEN - MASSEY MANSION

               Marylin sits in the den. She's had some coffee and, although 
               teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I just cried when I got home. Somehow, 
                         your disdain for me -- I'm pretty 
                         tough Miles, but I'm human. All my 
                         life people have been ascribing these 
                         terrible motives to me. I used to 
                         think they were jealous, or they 
                         didn't understand, but... I dunno. 
                         Maybe others see something in me. 
                         Something I'm not even aware of. 
                         Anyway, thank you for letting me 
                         come here. I guess I was a little 
                         drunk.

               She takes the coffee cup and has a sip. She looks like a 
               lost waif.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You have a very nice home, Miles. 
                         Very inviting.

                                     MILES
                         Thank you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You have wonderful art. I love that 
                         lithograph. Hockney?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. I just got that, actually. It 
                         was a gift.

                                     MARYLIN
                         From a -- girlfriend.

                                     MILES
                         No. No. I don't have a... no. It was 
                         from a client.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No kidding. I'll bet you have some 
                         very grateful clients. What'd Rex 
                         buy you?

                                     MILES
                         Rex sent me two humidors full of pre-
                         Castro Cubans.

               Marylin looks at a photograph Miles has on a side table.

               A WOMAN AND TWO SMALL BOYS.

               The Woman has her arm around one of them. The other stands 
               close to her. Smiling, but awkward and tentative.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is that you?

                                     MILES
                         Me. Yes.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh. And that is -- mom?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You look like you were a very 
                         sensitive child. You have expressive 
                         eyes.

               Miles walks over to look at the picture.

                                     MILES
                         Hmmm...

                                     MARYLIN
                         And your mother was very beautiful. 
                         She must be proud of you.

                                     MILES
                         She never particularly cared for me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         She didn't love you?

                                     MILES
                         No. She loved me. She would never 
                         not love her son. She just didn't... 
                         I wasn't her "type." She said I was 
                         a very, colicky baby. You know? 
                         Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't 
                         eat well? We got off to a bad start, 
                         and she never seemed to recoup --

                                     MARYLIN
                         She held that against you?

                                     MILES
                         Apparently she was very disappointed.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Boy. Boy, oh boy.

               Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can see 
               how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of something 
               genuine crosses her face.

                                     MARYLIN
                         And here I thought my mother was...

                                     MILES
                         Your mother was.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh right. You met Patricia.

               She takes a sip of coffee. Regards Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         We're damaged goods.

                                     MILES
                         No, we're not!

                                     MARYLIN
                         We are, Miles. You know I'm right. 
                         There's something "off" about you 
                         and me Miles. And maybe it isn't 
                         because of these women -- maybe they 
                         were just extremely insightful and 
                         recognized our "deficiencies" very 
                         early on. Maybe...

                                     MILES
                         That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch 
                         and yours is a psycho. I can't believe 
                         you're saying this, Marylin! There's 
                         nothing wrong with us. We're 
                         attractive and charismatic and 
                         successful and... I like us.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen 
                         to me. I'm sure you have a very 
                         fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm 
                         depressing.

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Thank you for the coffee. It's very 
                         robust.

               She stands. Picks up her purse. Walks over to him with an 
               outstretched hand.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Friends?

                                     MILES
                         Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

               He doesn't release her hand. Instead he draws her to him, 
               and kisses her. She kisses him. He kisses her back. She...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mile and Marylin -- making love.

               LATER

               They are in post coital wrap.

                                     MILES
                         I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. 
                         I'm never speechless.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not 
                         used to losing control with such -- 
                         volume.

                                     MILES
                         And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- 
                         there's something I want to ask you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What is it Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I want... I want to...

               She waits, puzzled.

                                     MILES
                         I want to be your -- your wife.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Huh?

                                     MILES
                         No... That wasn't right. I want YOU 
                         to be MY wife.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Did you just propose to me?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. I am. What else could those 
                         words mean? I believe we belong 
                         together and we can make one another 
                         happy. And we should be happy because 
                         happiness is better than the 
                         alternative which is -- just jump in 
                         any old time, Marylin. You have more 
                         experience at this than I do.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes.

                                     MILES
                         Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes, Miles. I accept.

                                     MILES
                         You do?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you want me to sleep on it?

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you want to sleep on it?

                                     MILES
                         No ma'am. I have been asleep all my 
                         life up to this moment. Marylin, 
                         will you marry me?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. Again.

               They kiss.

                                     MILES
                         I don't have a ring!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know.

                                     MILES
                         I have a watch.

               She laughs. Kisses him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm happy.

               INT. CHAPEL

               Miles and Kenneth wait. Dressed in suits. Miles looks nervous.

                                     KENNETH
                         I'm happy for you, pal.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, buddy.

                                     KENNETH
                         Is she Asian?

                                     MILES
                         Asian? No.

                                     KENNETH
                         Well... I'm still...

               Wrigley, rushes in, carrying a briefcase.

                                     MILES
                         Wrigley?

                         Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. 
                         Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         The plastic surgeon! I read about 
                         you in LA Style.

                                     MILES
                         Do you have it?

                                     KENNETH
                         I have it.

                                     MILES
                         You have the pre-nup?

                                     KENNETH
                         No. I have the ring. Was I supposed 
                         to have a pre-nup?

                                     MILES
                         No. You have the ring. Wrigley has 
                         the pre-nup.

                                     KENNETH
                         Oh. I thought maybe --
                              (He sees someone)
                         Gee!

               Marylin enters. She looks outstanding. Her friends, Sarah 
               Sorkin and Ramona Barcelona (who is now visibly pregnant) 
               accompany her.

                                     SARAH
                         Dr. Beck!

                                     KENNETH
                         Sarah! How are you?

                                     MILES
                         You know each other? Of course you 
                         do.

                                     RAMONA
                         You're Dr. Beck? I have an appointment 
                         to see you in March. Right after I 
                         lose the babyweight. Which of course, 
                         will be after I have the baby...

                         Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- 
                         this is Miles Massey.

                                     SARAH
                         Hello Miles.

                                     RAMONA
                         Congratulations Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hi. Hello.
                              (To Marylin)
                         Marylin. You know my young associate, 
                         Wrigley.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do. He was at my divorce and my 
                         wedding. What would a marital related 
                         event be without Wrigley?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         It has become a tradition, hasn't 
                         it?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I loved the berry spoons.
                              (Wrigley beams)
                         I didn't have any. Thank you.

                                     MILES
                         Well, Wrigley brought something else 
                         for you today, darling.

               Wrigley pulls a sheaf of papers from the briefcase.

                                     MILES
                         This -- is the Massey Pre-nup.

               Wrigley hastily pulls a ballpoint from his pocket and clicks 
               it. Miles grabs the pre-nup, and as he turns to Marylin, his 
               tone softens.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin, you're welcome to examine 
                         it, but as you know -- it's iron 
                         clad.

                                     SARAH
                         It is. It's famous.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't 
                         get her.

                                     MILES
                         We wanted Ruth here for your 
                         protection as well --

                                     WRIGLEY
                         The Judge is here. Over here, Judge 
                         Munson.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce 
                         hearing?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. Short notice you know, but I 
                         think there's nice closure to it. 
                         Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as 
                         always.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         What's up with you two.

                                     MILES
                         We're getting married.

               Judge laughs.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         What's the gag?

                                     MILES
                         A gag? No.

               Marylin looks at the pre-nup. Then pulls Miles aside.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Excuse me, Judge Muson.

                                     JUDGE
                         You got it, Patty.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Miles)
                         You brought a pre-nup to our wedding?

                                     MILES
                         Yes.
                              (She isn't having the 
                              expected reaction)
                         It's for your protection, sweetheart. 
                         You're the one with the -- the...

                                     WRIGLEY
                         -- the coin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. I don't want to sign this. I 
                         want this marriage to be different. 
                         Okay. Judge Munsen and Wrigley are 
                         here, but other than that...

                                     JUDGE
                         Should I go out for a smoke?

                                     MILES
                         No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, 
                         if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit 
                         from the marriage.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sadly)
                         Oh Miles!

                                     MILES
                         What I mean is, your wealth is 
                         completely protected.

               As if a lead veil had been drawn across. She looks deep into 
               his eyes. Into his soul.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. Listen to me. You are about 
                         to become my husband. I don't want 
                         to be protected from you. I want to 
                         be protected for you.

                                     WRIGLEY
                              (Moved)
                         Ohhh...

                                     MILES
                         But?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want this to be a marriage based 
                         on love, trust and community property. 
                         That's all I've ever wanted.

                                     SARAH
                         But Marylin, without this, you're 
                         completely exposed.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want to be exposed.

                                     RAMONA
                         You're vulnerable.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's about time.

                                     JUDGE
                         You're a sitting duck.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Miles, with great 
                              affection)
                         Quack.

               INT. CHAPEL

               Miles and Marylin stand before the alter.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey 
                         Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-
                         Doyle?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         "Doyle", to be your lawful wedded 
                         wife to --

                                     MILES
                         I do, yah I do, uh huh --

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         Let me finish!

               She glares at Miles.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         -- Jesus! Haven't you ever been 
                         married before?

               Chastened, Miles bows his head.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         -- To have and hold, to love and to 
                         cherish, till death do you part?

               There is a long beat, through which Miles stares at his shoes.

               Marylin looks at him.

                                     MILES
                         -- I do.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth 
                         Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of 
                         Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful 
                         wedded husband, to have and to hold, 
                         to love and to cherish, till death 
                         do you part?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         I now pronounce you man and wife.

               Wrigley bursts into tears.

               THE MARRIED MASSEY MONTAGE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - MORNING

               Miles and Marylin asleep in bed. The ALARM RINGS. Miles wakes, 
               turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning.

               She gives him a sleepy Smile.

               Miles dressing for work. Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe 
               places a tray with coffee next to him. He holds up two ties 
               for her-approval. She selects one. He puts it on.

               Miles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast. 
               She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry 
               spoons. They laugh heartily.

               Marylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office. 
               She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the 
               lawn.

               MILES OFFICE

               He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married 
               life. Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful, 
               the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them.

               Miles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I have Mrs. Massey on line one for 
                         you.

               Miles picks up.

                                     MILES
                         Mom...?

               He laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming 
               through the receiver.

               Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin 
               at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home.

               As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis?) 
               Marylin sits at the edge of the bed. He's telling her about 
               his day, and she is rapt with attention.

               The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The 
               tulips are in the middle of the table.

               Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld. 
               Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows, 
               but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a 
               nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and 
               nastiness. He puts down his book as she gets into bed with 
               him.

               They gaze at one another -- the picture of contentment and 
               impending lust.

               EXT. MASSEY MYERSON - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Miles is addressing the young associates.

                                     MILES
                         For the first time in my life, I 
                         stand before you naked... 
                         vulnerable... and in love. Love. A 
                         word matrimonial lawyers shy away 
                         from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have 
                         been frightened of this emotion which 
                         is, in a sense, the seed of my 
                         livelihood. But today, I am here to 
                         tell you: Love should cause us no 
                         fear. Love should cause us no shame. 
                         Love... is good.
                              (He lets it sink in)
                         Let me ask you a question. When our 
                         clients come to us confused, angry, 
                         hurting because their flame of love 
                         is fluttering and threatens to die -- 
                         should we seek to extinguish that 
                         flame, so that we can sift through 
                         the smoldering wreckage for our paltry 
                         reward? Or should we seek to fan 
                         this precious flame -- this most 
                         precious flame -- back to loving, 
                         roaring life?

               The young associates look confused. Wrigley raises his hand.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Extinguish?

                                     MILES
                         Should we counsel fear -- or trust? 
                         Should we seek to destroy -- or to 
                         build? Should we meet our clients' 
                         problems with cynicism -- or with 
                         love?

                                     MILES
                              (another raised hand)
                         Kramer?

                                     KRAMER
                         Build?

                                     MILES
                         The decision of course, is each of 
                         ours. For my part, I have made the 
                         leap of love, and there is no going 
                         back --

               Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room. He watches, 
               breathing heavily.

               INT. DEN - MASSEY HOUSE

               Miles and Marylin watching a cable movie crowded together on 
               the small sofa.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll 
                         move to the...

                                     MILES
                         No. Stay. I want you close to me. 
                         This couch is wrong. It's not a 
                         "married couch."

               He surveys his surroundings with a critical eye.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Honey, I could sit...

                                     MILES
                         In fact, this is not a married house -- 
                         it's a bachelor pad.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hardly. You have six bedrooms

                                     MILES
                         I know. But I've converted most of 
                         them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- 
                         a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- 
                         Honey, want you to go out, as soon 
                         as you feel up to it -- and buy 
                         married things. Woman things. 
                         Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make 
                         this your house.

               He hands her a credit card.

                                     MILES
                         Here's my card. Spend as much as you 
                         want. We get mileage.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, I suppose I could "girly" it 
                         up for you with a little Fortuny, 
                         and some passementerie --

                                     MILES
                         Good.
                              (Beat)
                         Are those foods?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Fabric and fringe.

                                     MILES
                         Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not 
                         right away -- There's a room right 
                         off the bedroom -- It would be perfect 
                         for a nursery.
                              (He takes her hands)
                         It's a walk in humidor right now -- 
                         but if I took out the refrigeration 
                         unit --

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I think a nursery should be right 
                         off the master suite. My parents put 
                         mine in the guest house. Apparently 
                         they did have a Fisher Price intercom, 
                         but my mother turned it off when I 
                         was seven months old because I was 
                         so --

               She stops him with a kiss.

                                     MILES
                         You want children, don't you?

               INT. QUATRAIN ANTIQUES - DAY

               A pricey antique store near Melrose.

                                     RAMONA
                         You said 'yes' didn't you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I said yes.

               She picks up an antique Chinese bowl.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is this Ming?

                                     SARAH
                         It's not Ming. It's Tong.

                                     RAMONA
                         Is Tong older than Ming?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I think Ming is older than Tong.
                              (To the Salesman 
                              hovering nearby)
                         What is this?

                                     SALESMAN
                         That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's 
                         Chen dynasty.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ok. I'll take it.

               He sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the 
               girls have accumulated.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I can't do this anymore. Let's get 
                         some lunch.

                                     SARAH
                         What about rugs? I thought we were 
                         stopping at Mansour?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Right.

                                     SALESMAN
                              (To Marylin)
                         And will this be check or --?

               She hands him the Platinum Visa.

                                     SALESMAN
                              (Glances at it)
                         Very good, Mrs. Massey.

               He trots off with the card.

               Marylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sigh)
                         Well. He said to "make the house 
                         mine."

                                     RAMONA
                         Oh boy. If he only knew.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yeah. I guess. You know --

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     MARYLIN
                         He's not what I expected. He's very -- 
                         he's so -- happy.

                                     SARAH
                         But you're going through with it?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've 
                         never been the first wife. Rex was 
                         married before me.

                                     SARAH
                         So what?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles is different. He's still so 
                         idealistic.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, that's about to change big 
                         time.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He has no cynicism or anger. For 
                         once I'm not the repository of rage 
                         at some other woman.

                                     SARAH
                         Soon, you'll have your own rage!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I guess.

               INT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING

               Miles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers. As he exits he is 
               stopped by a WOMAN. She is in her 40's but looks older.

                                     WOMAN
                         Wait. I know you.

                                     MILES
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         You're Miles Massey! You probably 
                         don't recognize me. The drugs made 
                         me put on weight and grow facial 
                         hair.

                                     MILES
                         Excuse me?

                                     WOMAN
                         You ruined my life you sonofabitch. 
                         Gimme those.

               She grabs the flowers. Pulls petal off one of the roses and 
               eats it.

                                     WOMAN
                         But my brother got you. He got you, 
                         you slimeball.

               A NURSE runs over.

                                     NURSE
                         Emily!

                                     MILES
                         What are you...
                              (To the nurse)
                         Is she yours?

                                     WOMAN
                         Howard Doyle is my brother? You know 
                         my brother, Howard Doyle. You do 
                         know my brother, don't you?

                                     NURSE
                         I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man 
                         back.

                                     MILES
                         Yes, I know Howard Doyle.

                                     WOMAN
                         He tricked you. With a phony wife 
                         and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He 
                         got you. You married Marylin, didn't 
                         you? You thought she had money. HA 
                         HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think 
                         that because of what you did to me. 
                         And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard 
                         all about it. My brother Howard Doyle 
                         got you.
                              (singsong)

               INT. RUTH RABINOW'S OFFICE

               Ruth calmly watches Miles ranting around her office.

                                     MILES
                         He divorced his wife -- he married 
                         Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- 
                         and he -- remarried his WIFE? What 
                         kind of sick --

                                     RUTH
                         Marylin was friends with Howard and 
                         Amanda Doyle. They don't like the 
                         way you operate. They helped her.

                                     MILES
                         He never ate the pre-nup, did he!

                                     RUTH
                         I have no idea what Howard Doyle 
                         eats. I'm not a damn dietician.

                                     MILES
                         Did Marylin end up with money?

                                     RUTH
                         She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask 
                         her? Anyway, I assume she signed the 
                         highly over rated Massey pre-nup.

                                     MILES
                         I don't have a pre-nup

               Miles hangs his head. Ruth sighs sympathetically.

                                     RUTH
                         ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in 
                         our stars...

                                     MILES
                         Don't give me that crap. That's MY 
                         crap.

                                     RUTH
                         And it's good!

                                     MILES
                         I'll have you suspended. I'll have 
                         you disbarred.

                                     RUTH
                         Don't threaten me, Miles. I did 
                         nothing illegal.

                                     MILES
                         ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?

                                     RUTH
                         That's attorney client privilege.
                              (As she goes back 
                              into her work)
                         Sorry, Miles. But as a great and 
                         clever man once said, What's good 
                         for the goose --

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Marylin greets him at the door.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hi.

                                     MILES
                         Hello Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I have a surprise for you.

                                     MILES
                         I bet.

               She brings him inside. The place has been massively 
               accessorized. Antiques, rugs, lamps and assorted tasteful 
               chatchkies. There is a new Biedermeyer couch in the den.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ta Da.

               Miles looks at it, expressionless.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't like it?

               He stares at her -- a very dark look.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't like me?

                                     MILES
                              (Flatly)
                         I love you. I want to have your baby.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too 
                         much?

               She retrieves all the receipts from her purse.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. I have a very good relationship 
                         with all the salesmen. I can return 
                         everything.

                                     MILES
                         Can you Marylin? Can you return the 
                         trust? Can you return the hopes? The 
                         dreams? Can you just...
                              (Bitterly)
                         SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? You're scaring me.

                                     MILES
                              (Pulls himself together)
                         I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's 
                         chic and timeless and elegant and 
                         eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It 
                         is YOU.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Marylin is on the phone with Ruth.

                                     MARYLIN
                         But Ruth -- things have changed -- 
                         yes -- yes I understand. But you see -- 
                         I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I 
                         wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe 
                         Ruth -- Yes. Okay.

               OUTSIDE BEDROOM - MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The bedroom door is closed. Marylin knocks repeatedly.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please 
                         open the door. I want to talk to 
                         you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I 
                         come.

               She pushes the door open. No Miles in sight. On the bed, 
               scrawled on a piece of mMm stationery, taped to one of the 
               mMm Frette pillows -- a note which reads -- "If you prick 
               us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If 
               you poison us, do we not die? AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE 
               NOT REVENGE?"

               INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE

               Kenneth stares at the chessboard. Court TV is on the 
               background.

               TV SCREEN

               COURT TV REPORTER

               We are back at the Trial of New Jersey v. Medrano. Mr. Medrano 
               is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992. He claims it 
               was suicide. Let's return to the courtroom.

               See the action in the courtroom --

               The Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         How far would this gun have to be in 
                         order to inflict a wound without 
                         leaving powder burns on the scalp.

                                     EXPERT WITNESS
                         Approximately three feet.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot 
                         herself in the back of the head from 
                         a distance of three feet?

                                     KENNETH
                         Really long arms?

               He moves a piece.

                                     MILES
                         They won't get a conviction. The 
                         husband called it in as a suicide. 
                         The forensic guys weren't thinking 
                         murder. I'm sure some of the evidence 
                         was compromised.

                                     KENNETH
                         It's your move, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (Sadly)
                         I already made my move, Kenneth.

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE

               A private yoga class. Marylin, Sarah and Ramona are in the 
               plow position. The yuppie Sikh instructor places his weight 
               on Sarah.

                                     SARAH
                         Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts.

                                     VISHNU
                         Breathe through it.

               Sarah tries a few deep breaths. Marylin concentrates hard.

                                     VISHNU
                         That's good, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't even know where he is. He 
                         looked so devastated. If I could 
                         just talk to him for a few minutes.

               SFX DOORBELL

                                     MARYLIN
                         Was that the bell?

                                     RAMONA
                         It sounded like a bell.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'll be right back.

               INT. HALLWAY - MASSEY HOUSE

               Marylin walks to the door. Opens it. Two POLICE OFFICERS.

                         Yes? Can I help you?

                         We have a warrant for your arrest.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What?

               INT. POLICE STATION - MONTAGE - DAY

               Marylin is photographed front and profile. She is finger 
               printed; she is searched and relieved of her jewelry; and 
               finally, she is throw into a holding tank with several other 
               women -- trapped. She clings despondently to the bars.

               INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               Ruth is admitted to the holding area.

               INT. HOLDING TANK - DAY

               A Police Officer walks down the hall. Unlocks the door.

                         You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone 
                         made bail.

               Marylin exits.

               INT. RUTH'S CAR

               Marylin sits next to Ruth.

                         Forgery and Fraud?

                                     RUTH
                         You used his credit card.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He told me to -- he said he wanted 
                         me to --

                                     RUTH
                         Quite a little shopping spree. How 
                         do you spend six figures in less 
                         than six hours? Oh, never mind I've 
                         seen it before. I've seen everything.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you think he set me up? Do you 
                         think that was his intention?

                                     RUTH
                         Like I know his intention? Or yours 
                         for that matter?
                              (Sighs)
                         I should join Sam. I'm too old for 
                         this bullshit.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He never even asked. He just assumed --

                                     RUTH
                         He was right, wasn't he?

                                     MARYLIN
                         So. Now what?

                                     RUTH
                         Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a 
                         deal or find out how Jean Harris 
                         made it work for her.

               Miles opens the door. Marylin is standing there.

                                     MILES
                         Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!

                                     MARYLIN
                         May I come in?

                         I don't know. Maybe I should grab my 
                         mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have 
                         little experience with "the criminal 
                         mind."

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'd just like to pick up a few of my 
                         things

                                     MILES
                         I don't believe you have "things."

                                     MARYLIN
                         On the contrary. We're married and 
                         we have no pre-nup, so a case could 
                         be made that everything in here is 
                         mine.

               Marylin walks into the den. Sits on the new sofa.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Comfy!

                                     MILES
                         What do you want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want to nail you ass.

                                     MILES
                         Are you threatening me, because I'm 
                         sure that's a violation of the terms 
                         of your bail.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm reporting you to the IRS.

                                     MILES
                         The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting 
                         a refund.

               He laughs. She looks at him, dead serious.

                                     MILES
                         I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported 
                         every dollar I've ever made. Try 
                         again, girlfriend.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm not talking about dollars, 
                         studmuffin. I'm talking about --

               She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         STUFF.

                         Got a light?

                                     MILES
                         What kind of "stuff?"

               She reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly 
               lights the cigar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Arty Farty stuff.

                         Watches and mileage on private jets. 
                         Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from 
                         grateful clients.

                                     MILES
                         Those are gifts.

                                     MARYLIN

                         Bellagio Road?

                                     MILES
                         You can't prove anything.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't have to. That's what the IRS 
                         guys do. And they do it with great 
                         zeal. See, they work at these tortuous 
                         civil service jobs, and when five 
                         hundred dollar an hour boys like you 
                         take their trade out in luxury 
                         goodies, these saps feel.. well, 
                         they feel like saps. And they feel 
                         bitter and they feel vengeful and 
                         they feel WRATH.
                              (Puffing on the cigar)
                         What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?

                                     MILES
                         You're out of your league, Marylin. 
                         Rexroth was a primate. I'm a 
                         professional.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know. So am I, right? And so is 
                         Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue 
                         Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid 
                         graduate of Southwestern University -- 
                         very tenacious, and never more so 
                         than when he's dealing with an 
                         unscrupulous colleague.
                              (She stands to leave)
                         I think it's only fair to warn you: 
                         I'm going to file an action, Miles. 
                         And after a decent interval I plan 
                         to have Ruth seek an injunction that 
                         will forbid your approach within 500 
                         feet of my house.

                                     MILES
                         Meaning my house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I believe the residence will be part 
                         of the settlement.

                                     MILES
                         Did our marriage ever mean anything 
                         to you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Drop the bogus forgery charge and 
                         I'll forget about your generous 
                         friends slash clients.

                                     MILES
                         That's blackmail.

                                     MARYLIN
                         That's marriage.

               She gives him a peck on the cheek. As she leaves:

                                     MARYLIN
                         You'll always be my favorite husband.

               Miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the 
               paintings. He looks at the watch. And the cigars. And the 
               picture of his mother.

                                     MILES
                         Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy 
                         this.

               CLOSE ON A BAG OF FLUIDS

               We pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show 
               that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb 
               Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage.

               She now places it up on the IV gantry and connects, and swaps 
               the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. 
               We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its 
               venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, 
               enigmatic figure.

                                     HERB
                         This woman has humbled, shamed and 
                         disgrazed the entire foim.

               A reverse shows Miles standing in front of Herb's desk.

                                     MILES
                         Yes Herb,

                                     HERB

                         to the music..

               He waves his free arm to the beat of music unheard.

                                     HERB
                         -- of the hoidy-goidy.

                                     MILES
                         I understand Herb... I just... for 
                         the first time in my career -- I 
                         don't know what to do. I'm a patsy. 
                         A sitting duck. I'm lost.

                                     HERB
                         Lost! I'll tell you what you can do, 
                         you can --

               He brings himself up short and turns to the nurse.

                                     HERB
                         -- leave us.

               She heads for the door.

                                     HERB
                         -- You can act like a man. Let me 
                         tell you sumpn, smart guy. You tawt 
                         you had it all figgud out. Trust.

                         gonna talk to you about the goddamn 
                         LAW.

               He climbs unsteadily to his feet and tries to pace, 
               gesticulating, with the IV swaying dangerously behind him.

                                     HERB
                         -- We SOIVE THE LAW! We HONUH the

                         counseluh, we OBEY THE LAW --

               He pauses to let this sink in.

                                     HERB
                         -- but conseluh -- This is not one a

               CLOSE ON

               An edgy looking gangster, JOE. He is perspiring heavily. He 
               breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an 
               asthmatic.

               His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at 
               someone off. At length, a voice:

                                     VOICE
                         ...Are you Joe?

               Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster 
               raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes. 
               WHUSH.

               A reverse shows Miles seated across a small round table in a 
               seedy low-lit clam house. Photos of Ted Kennedy and the Pope 
               adorn the walls..

                         it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though 
                         he's not involved. And because of an 
                         impending legal action this needs to 
                         happen within a certain... time frame. 
                         Uh... on an expedited basis.

               The gangster stares expressionlessly. He raises the inhaler 
               again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes. WHUSH.

                                     GANGSTER
                         You're in a rush.

                                     MILES
                         Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.

               A long beat. Finally, Miles explodes

                                     MILES
                         She won't suffer, will she?

               He bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster. The 
               gangster stares impassively back.

                                     GANGSTER
                         ...not unless you pay extra.

               INT. REX REXROTH MANSION

               An enormous oak paneled room. Furnished with chairs sofas 
               and a huge circular bed. A fire roars in the far corner. On 
               the wall above the bed a film loop is being projected -- 
               soft core pornographic images.

               On the bed, Rex is surrounded by three naked beauties, smeared 
               in cola dust and wearing conductor caps.

                                     REX
                         I've been working on the railroad --

                         All the livelong day!

                                     REX
                         I've been working on the railroad

                                     TARTS
                         Just to pass the time away!

                                     REX
                         Can'tcha hear the whistle... the 
                         whistle... AWWWWWWW.

               Rex hunches over, clutching his left arm.

               One by one, the girls stop dancing and stare. There is a 
               somber silence, broken by another.

                                     REX
                         Awwwwwww --

               The girls are all watching now. One of them steps forward.

                                     TART
                         -- Whatsa matter, Rexie?

               INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE

               A guest room. Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of 
               expensive French wine.

               We hear a phone ringing in a different room. It rings several 
               times.

               The figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a 
               pillow over his head.

               The ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear 
               a muffled voice:

                                     VOICE
                         Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute --

               We hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the 
               background, knotting a bathrobe. He turns on the light in 
               the room.

                                     KENNETH
                         Miles. It's for you.

               The figure on the couch pulls away the pillow. It is indeed 
               Miles Massey. He blearily takes the offered phone.

                                     MILES
                         Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see --

               After another listening beat he drops the phone away. He 
               remains staring dully out into space.

                                     MILES
                         My God.

                                     KENNETH
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         That was Marvin Untermeyer.

                                     KENNETH
                         Yes?

                                     MILES
                         He was Rex Rexroth's personal 
                         attorney.

                                     KENNETH
                         What do you mean, was.

                                     MILES
                         Rex just had a massive coronary. In 
                         the middle of a business meeting. 
                         He's dead.

               Kenneth is mildly puzzled.

                                     KENNETH
                         I'm sorry to hear that. But you 
                         weren't close, were you?

                                     MILES
                         Marvin says that Rex's will is four 
                         years old. He never redrafted it.

                                     KENNETH
                         Yes.

               Miles voice is still flat, expressionless:

                                     MILES
                         Everything goes to Marylin.

               He looks up a at Kenneth.

                                     MILES
                         She's rich. We're still married. We 
                         have no pre-nup.

                                     KENNETH
                         So, that's good, right?

               MINUTES LATER

               Miles paces with the telephone. He punches numbers with the 
               thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a 
               coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps.

                                     VOICE
                         This is Joe. Wuddya need?

               Then a beep.

                                     MILES
                         Joe. This is Mr. uh... friend of -- 
                         we met. This is to instruct you it's 
                         No Go! Do you understand me?! NO GO 
                         on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go.

               He slams down the phone.

                                     KENNETH
                         Who was that?

                                     MILES
                         That was -- oh, shit. What if he's 
                         on his way over there?

                                     KENNETH
                         Huh?

               Consumed with remorse, Miles moans.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! What have I done?

                                     KENNETH
                         I don't know, but don't call me 
                         Marylin.

               MILES CAR

               Miles drives, speeding, taking corners hard while punching 
               numbers into his car phone.

                                     MILES
                         Get her out, buy some time; get her 
                         out --

               INT. MASSEY MANSION - NIGHT

               In the bedroom, the phone starts ringing. A hand enters to 
               pick it up. We follow the hand up to reveal

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hello?

               MILES SPEEDING CAR

                                     MILES
                         Marylin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? Miles! Where have you been? 
                         I've been trying to get in touch.

                                     MILES
                         You have to leave the house 
                         immediately!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I will, Miles. I will leave. But 
                         Miles --

                                     MILES
                         No buts. Now. Out.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. 
                         It's true that my initial intention 
                         was to...

                                     MILES
                         Please! Leave the house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I fell in love Miles.

                                     MILES
                         So did I. Now pack up a few basics 
                         and --

                                     MARYLIN
                         You do? You do love me?

               MASSEY MANSION

               Marylin hangs up the phone.

               She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece 
               to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she 
               contemplatively regards.

               We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He 
               stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for 
               a moment, but quickly recoups:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.

                                     JOE
                         Mr. Dumbarton.

               She shows him the picture of Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is this Mr. Dumbarton?

                                     JOE
                         No...

               She cocks an eye at him.

                                     JOE
                         That's his lawyer.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Triple!

                                     JOE
                         Who's the pigeon?

               We faintly hear a car screeching to a halt.

               EXT. MASSEY MANSION

               Massey exits the car. He clutches a can of mace.

               INT. MANSION

               We hear a key scrape in the lock. The front door swings open 
               onto a dark foyer as Miles tiptoes in.

                                     MILES
                              (Whispers)
                         Marylin?

               DINING ROOM

               Miles tiptoes through, looking warily about. He backs through 
               the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen. Finds himself 
               face to face with Joe.

                                     MILES
                         Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're 
                         not in time. I'm in time. Thank God 
                         I'm in time.

               Joe stares at him.

                                     MILES
                         It's a no go! Get it? No one any the 
                         wiser. Okay!

               He makes a cow-herding motion with his hands.

                                     MILES
                         You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks 
                         so much!

               Joe takes out his gun.

                                     MILES
                         No no! No contract! It's all over.

               This has no effect on Joe who is unscrewing his silencer.

               Miles is exasperated. Suddenly -- Marylin appears.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's a no go, Joe.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin!

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's okay Joe.

               Joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt.

                                     MILES
                         Wait! He works for YOU?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Now. But first, he worked for you.

                                     MILES
                         You were going to have this thug...?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Wait just a second there. You sent 
                         him here. You unearthed this 
                         pestilence.

                                     JOE
                         You're calling me a pestilence? That's 
                         a hoot!

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Joe)
                         I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- 
                         but, we changed our minds.
                              (To Miles)
                         Did you really mean what you said on 
                         the phone. It wasn't because you 
                         found out about Rex?

                                     MILES
                         Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. 
                         I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No 
                         matter what happened to you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         That's true.

                                     JOE
                         Lemme tell you something. You are 
                         the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay 
                         you the twenty thousand.

                                     MILES
                         It was fifty for you.

                                     JOE
                              (To Miles)
                         That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave 
                         her the lawyer discount.
                              (Looks at Marylin)
                         But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a 
                         whore. A whore who worships the 
                         dollar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, actually, all whores worship 
                         the dollar, if you want to get 
                         technical.

                                     JOE
                         Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like 
                         you. And my clients? Whores just 
                         like you.

                                     MILES
                         Were you with a firm?

                                     JOE
                         Kaplan.

                                     MILES
                         Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're 
                         Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked -- 
                         You were great -- we studied you.

                                     JOE
                         Twenty years in "matrimonial law" 
                         and it made me sick.
                              (He wheezes)
                         I broke up homes and families, never 
                         givin' it a second thought. Till one 
                         day. I had an epiphany. You know 
                         what that is?
                              (They nod)
                         Came with a damn stigmata if you can 
                         believe that! I said to myself -- 
                         Joe -- everyone you see wants blood. 
                         Everyone wants their ex's dead. So 
                         why jerk around with rest. You wanna 
                         best serve your clients? Kill em.

               Joe is raising the gun at Miles. Miles sprays him with Mace.

               BANG -- Joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the 
               chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a 
               take-off.

               SLAM -- Marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose. 
               She finishes with a solid groin kick. It slows him down, but 
               doesn't stop him.

               Joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing.

               BANG -- Joe is rampaging around the room, still firing, 
               thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler. 
               Marylin runs to Miles. He takes her hand and they run toward 
               the door, seeking egress.

               BANG -- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly 
               bobbles it.

               Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from 
               falling. He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler.

               Miles pops up in front of him.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm not leaving you. I took self 
                         defense

               Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points 
               the inhaler at Miles.

               He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the asthma 
               mist and lets out a horrified:

                                     MILES
                         Joe!

               BANG! The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a 
               body dropping heavily to the floor.

               Silence.

               Marylin runs over to Miles. They look sadly down at the floor.

                                     MILES
                         WE told him it was no go...

               INT. MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against 
               the other.

               Miles sits gazing sadly out the window.

               The room is empty.

               There is the whir of ventilation.

               The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings 
               them to their feet.

               Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by 
               Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attaché case on the 
               table top, and snaps its clasps.

                                     RUTH
                         Alright.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Ruth.

               Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:

                                     MILES
                         Hello Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hello Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hard to believe this is the way it 
                         will end up for us.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's not something I wanted either.

                                     MILES
                         But then -- I guess -- something 
                         inside me died when I realized that 
                         you'd hired a goon to kill me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt 
                         when I realized you'd hired the goon 
                         to kill...

                                     RUTH
                         Now you both wait a minute. Nobody 
                         hired anyone to kill anyone.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Hear, hear.

               There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks 
               at Miles.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Apparently, from what I can gather, 
                         a burglar broke into your house -- 
                         became despondent over his lifestyle 
                         and shot himself.

               Miles is still looking at Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         Where does that leave us?

                                     RUTH
                         We've outlined a settlement...

               She pushes a piece of paper across the table.

                                     RUTH
                         We think it's more than generous.

               Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle 
               of the table. He looks at Marylin.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         My client is prepared to consider a 
                         reconciliation.

               Marylin looks a Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         How could I trust you, after... after 
                         all of this.

               Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:

                                     MILES
                         You wounded me first, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?

                                     MILES
                         You're forgetting Howard Doyle?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Forgery? Fraud?

                                     MILES
                         Income tax evasion?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Murder?

                                     MILES
                         Murder!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't see how we can ever find our 
                         way back from...

               Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit 
               coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the 
               table in front of him and, still gazing at her:

                                     MILES
                         You know... there's nothing in the 
                         Massey pre-nup that says it can't be 
                         executed after the parties wed.

               He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks 
               down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name.

               He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin.

               Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently 
               picks up the paper.

               There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, 
               and Wrigley's quiet snuffling.

               Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over 
               Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, 
               looks only at Miles.

                                     RUTH
                         It's the Massey pre-nup --

               Marylin rips the paper in half.

                                     RUTH
                              (bored)
                         O-kay. I'm going back to the office

               Wrigley sobs openly.

                                     RUTH
                         Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink 
                         and an anti depressant.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         No one will ever love me that way.

                                     RUTH
                         Not if you're lucky. No.

               Miles rises slowly to his feet.

               He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward.

               Marylin rises slowly to her feet.

               She leans forward.

               They kiss.

                                     MILES
                         Let's go home.

               EXT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY

               We hear a SMASHING -- BREAKING.

               Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but quickly 
               prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one 
               end of the yard to the other.

               TRACK THROUGH HOUSE TO

               INT. MASSEY BEDROOM

               The smashing is becoming louder.

               AN AXE

               Breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the 
               master suite.

                                     MILES
                         Wait. Just wait for one minute. Sweet 
                         Jesus, are you crazy?

               CONSTRUCTION WORKER LOOKS UP

               he's the one wielding the axe. His co-worker casts a look in 
               our direction.

               MILES

               reaches under the rubble and removes one box of Cohiba 
               Especials.

                                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                         Sorry, Mr. Massey. Thought you cleared 
                         that shit out.

                                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
                         You know, man... those things'll 
                         kill ya. I know all you old boomer 
                         potheads like em. They're illegal, 
                         and you get to put em in fancy boxes -- 
                         but -- shit man! It's still tobacco.

               ON MARYLIN

               Mightily pregnant.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You know, sweets, he's right.

               Miles casts a rueful look at the cigars.

                                     MILES
                         Pre-Castro.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Fine. They were created during a 
                         dictatorship.
                              (Placing a protective 
                              hand on her BIG belly)
                         What if something happened to you? 
                         What would I tell little Gus when he 
                         asked "what was my daddy like?"

               Miles looks at the box, then at his wife. He tosses the box 
               to the concerned construction worker.

               Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and 
               cacophony of a major seaport.

               We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the 
               GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries 
               it onto a ship.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Hi, sweetie.

               INT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT

               STELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped 
               out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel.

                                     STELLA
                         Daddy. How are you?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm sending you something.

                                     STELLA
                         Really? Does it smell nice?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         No. But it's sparkly.

                                     STELLA
                         Does it come with a receipt?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm having it sent to you from the 
                         store.

                                     STELLA
                              (toweling her hair)
                         Why not bring it by yourself? We 
                         could have dinner.

               He leaves the store and heads for the HOTEL ELEVATOR.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.

               She doesn't like the sound of that.

                                     STELLA
                         Let me guess. Checking out the 
                         birthplace of Christopher Columbus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Something like that.

                         With your parole officer's approval.

               He steps into the elevator. Rides up.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I think I've paid my P.O. my last 
                         visit. I liked the guy, but we never 
                         really connected.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you into, Dad? Don't break 
                         my heart. You told me you were 
                         through.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         After this, I swear to you, I am.

                                     STELLA
                         You promised me. Daddy, don't do 
                         this.

               The elevator door opens, Bridger steps out and starts down 
               the hall.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Everything's going to be fine. I've 
                         got to go now. I love you. Bye.

               He clicks off then uses his card key to step into the --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He eyes Charlie, who looks pretty tense.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Italians?

                         Not yet.

                                     STEVE
                         Don't worry, they'll come through. 
                         You can trust these guys.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.
                              (then, to Charlie)
                         Got a sec?

               They step inside, Charlie closing the door.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         How you feeling, boss?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Fine. I'm fine, fine.

               Bridger seems amused by that answer.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You know what fine, stands for, don't 
                         you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, 
                         and Emotional.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You've become quite the philosopher 
                         since you quit drinking.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You don't like me sober?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I'm glad. Makes you a better 
                         thief.

               Bridger pulls out a fine cigar, still in its wrapper, hands 
               it to Charlie.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         For after the haul.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's 
                         Italians are a no-show, it's three 
                         months prep down the shitter and 
                         I've dragged you out of retirement 
                         for nothing.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         This is kinda nice. You being the 
                         boss with all the worries, me just 
                         along for the ride.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ain't you sweet...

               From the other side of the door, they HEAR --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie takes the binoculars from Steve. He SEES TWO ITALIAN 
               CUSTOMS INSPECTORS climbing onboard the ship.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Your Italians.

                                     STEVE
                         Yup. Dixie cups.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dixie cups?

                                     STEVE
                         I toss 'em away if there's a problem 
                         down the road.

               EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

               In ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about 
               the mysterious crate.

               One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips 
               of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The 
               other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open.

               It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

               Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks 
               relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

               Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power 
               button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the 
               tomatoes...

               Handsome Rob pulls over. They're at the port. They can see 
               the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold.

               Half-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him.

               The Captain is doing his final checks before launch. OUR 
               CAMERA DROPS to --

               BENEATH THE WATER

               where we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon 
               explosive primer to the hull of the ship.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT

               Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded 
               beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve 
               is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the 
               laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his 
               bubble gum.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Can you chill out back there? You'd 
                         make a hummingbird nervous.

               EXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT

               Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his 
               gear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm done. Over.

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.

               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted 
               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into 
               deeper water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS

               Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John 
               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion 
               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at 
               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the 
               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's 
               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the 
               crate in the ship.

               EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT

               Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed 
               by just above his head. WHOOSH.

               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.

               EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT

               The hull of the boat EXPLODES.

               INT. SHIP'S HOLD

               A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate 
               is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through 
               the cavity, vanishing.

               UNDERWATER

               The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.

               ON THE SHIP

               Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. 
               The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.

               INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT

               Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to 
               the bay through infrared binoculars.

               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to 
               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.

               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT

               The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting 
               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard 
               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

               A large safe.

               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light 
               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels 
               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their 
               headsets, heard by all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sweet Jesus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         "That for which all virtue is sold. 
                         And almost every vice -- gold."

               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD 
               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one 
               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're 
               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.

               INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT

               They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be 
               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared 
               binoculars and sees --

               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then 
               disappear.

               EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER

               The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a 
               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves 
               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing 
               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, 
               going along for the ride.

               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which 
               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through 
               the water towards the secluded beach, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

               The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)

               The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.

               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in 
               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are 
               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who 
               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My name is John and I'm a very rich 
                         alcoholic. And I'm going to live my 
                         life one very rich day at a time.

                                     THE CREW
                         Alright, John!

               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the 
               Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As 
               Bridger lights it for him --

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You planned this one down to a t, 
                         kid. It's a gift. You saw the big 
                         picture, made contingencies, covered 
                         the angles...

               Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Shit, you made thirty million dollars 
                         in gold drop out of sight without 
                         holding a gun. Who else could've 
                         pulled that off?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You could've. I had big shoes to 
                         fill.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Fill the shoes but don't follow the 
                         footprints.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What're you talking about? You've 
                         lived the life.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My life's been nothing but fake IDs, 
                         fake business cards and divorce 
                         papers. This is the only thing that's 
                         real.

               Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in 
               his wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Stella's a beautiful girl.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         She's amazing. And I spent half her 
                         childhood in prison. This is a once 
                         in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring 
                         down the curtain after this one. 
                         Make a new life. Find someone amazing 
                         and be there for her.

               As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks 
               the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Shit.

               Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed 
               against Handsome Rob's temple.

                                     STEVE
                         Anyone acts stupid and his brains go 
                         on the windshield.

               They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-
               47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.

               ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     STEVE
                         Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of 
                         Cracker Jack all to myself.

               The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the 
               Humvee.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not thinking this through. 
                         It's a stupid move.

                                     STEVE
                         Think so? Well you're the brilliant 
                         one. The Master Planner. Isn't that 
                         so, John?

               Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, 
               the AK-47s aimed at the others.

                                     STEVE
                         You bet on the wrong horse.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         We'll hunt you down. You're gonna 
                         regret this.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.

                                     STEVE
                         No regrets, Dixie cup.

               BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.

               The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of 
               full automatic fire at the crew.

               INT. HUMVEE

               They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.

               Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter 
               of hell.

               Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.

               Driving blind.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, 
               metal tearing against metal.

               The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff 
               and the raging water below.

               The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.

               It careens off the road and --

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the 
               raging river.

               INT. HUMVEE

               Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown 
               around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger 
               door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is 
               swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie 
               looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

               Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not 
               all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.

               EXT. WATERFALL

               The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.

               It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser 
               of water.

               It sinks out of sight.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME

               The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep. Steve 
               climbs in, leaving the crew for dead.

               UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

               The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN

               The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the 
               two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.

               Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.

               INT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME

               The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot 
               mists the water red.

               They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but 
               Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body 
               and pulls it up with him.

               EXT. RIVER - SUNRISE

               They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie 
               pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, 
               and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment, 
               he holds Bridger. Not wanting to ever let go.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         If you would have told me that I 
                         would spend the next three years 
                         searching for Steve Bandell, I would 
                         have said that was nothing. Cause I 
                         would have spent a lifetime looking 
                         for that bastard if I had to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               SOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the 
               office is the beam of a penlight on the dial.

               GLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for "contact points", 
               areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- 
               if you have the touch.

               NEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while 
               trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.

               SUPERIMPOSE:

               She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever 
               and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of 
               pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS 
               TURN ON.

               TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You always work in the dark?

                                     STELLA
                         Buzz of the fluorescents throws me 
                         off. She's all yours.

               The cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're 
               on the same team.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack 
                         it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.

                                     STELLA
                         Now you know who to call first.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You're expensive, Stella. Those guys 
                         cut us a break on subpoena jobs. 
                         Goodwill, community service...

                                     STELLA
                         Well I do it for the money. I'll 
                         send you the bill.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Don't you want to see what's inside?

                                     STELLA
                         I never look. Bye, guys.

               And as she walks off, they do look -- at her.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini 
               Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low 
               to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives 
               it the legendary Mini look.

               If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't 
               bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile 
               soul.

               INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY

               Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind 
               the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo 
               Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the 
               Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.

               She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.

               Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two 
               gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.

               Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with 
               ease. She's right in front of --

               HER SHOP

               Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with 
               the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER 
               LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a 
               poised walk she heads inside.

               INT. SHOP - DAY

               It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along 
               with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         How long?

                                     STELLA
                         Four minutes, forty-three seconds.

               High-five.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         You're the man.

                                     STELLA
                         So what's on the line-up?

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. 
                         Owner died and the wife never knew 
                         the combination. And Todd Milliken 
                         called. He has a prototype combination 
                         lock he wants you to test out tomorrow 
                         morning. Says he added two false 
                         contact points on the tumbler.

                                     STELLA
                         Tell him if I don't have it opened 
                         in six minutes flat, breakfast is on 
                         me.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         And there's a Charlie Croker in your 
                         office. He said you two know each 
                         other.
                              (an aside)
                         And he looks pretty fine for a white 
                         boy.

               Without a response, Stella heads over to --

               HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR

               and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that 
               line the shelves.

                                     STELLA
                         Charlie Croker.

               He turns around. Smiles. Charming.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi, Stella.

               She steps inside.

                                     STELLA
                         Refresh my memory. After you came to 
                         see me and told me what happened to 
                         my father, I told you I never wanted 
                         to see you again, didn't I?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah. You did.

                                     STELLA
                         So I'm a little confused.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I found him.

               At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on 
               her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I can tell you where he is.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't want to know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you sure?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's in Los Angeles.

               She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask 
               him not to. So he goes on...

                                     CHARLIE
                         The gold bricks he stole from us 
                         were minted in Singapore and decorated 
                         with the face of a Balinese girl. 
                         I've had my tentacles out and got a 
                         call from a friend of mine and your 
                         father's, Philly Steak.

               Stella remembers him.

                                     STELLA
                         When I was little he would play poker 
                         at the house and drop quarters under 
                         the table for me to find.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He got word from an L.A. connection 
                         named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer 
                         has been buying bricks with the 
                         Balinese girl on them, three or four 
                         at a time.

                                     STELLA
                         You ever heard the expression, cut 
                         to the chase?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I tracked Steve down to an address 
                         in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed 
                         his last name to Frezelli. And get 
                         this: he had a Worthington 1000 
                         installed in the house before he 
                         even moved in. We both know that you 
                         don't install a Worthington 1000 
                         unless you have something precious 
                         to guard.

                                     STELLA
                         Precious or not, I don't deal with 
                         ill-gotten goods.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We boosted that gold from a terrorist 
                         group that was about to trade it for 
                         bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly 
                         make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our 
                         own little way we were doing a good 
                         deed. Problem is, no one in my crew 
                         can handle that safe. And I need 
                         someone I can trust.

                                     STELLA
                         And you think that's me? Haven't you 
                         heard that I work for the other side?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What I heard is that you have your 
                         father's touch. And he was the only 
                         safecracker I knew who could open a 
                         Worthington 1000.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm not a safecracker. I'm a 
                         professional safe and vault 
                         technician.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're John Bridger's daughter. And 
                         this is our chance to set things 
                         right.

               That sets her off.

                                     STELLA
                         Our chance? Who do you think you are 
                         coming in here? Stealing the gold 
                         isn't going to bring my father back 
                         to life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, it won't.

                                     STELLA
                         Then get out.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking 
               next to him.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         How'd it go with the chick?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm working on it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Gotta have her. Important piece of 
                         the puzzle.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         There has to be someone else. What 
                         about Bill Huchins?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Doing ten long at Levinworth.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Red O'Reilly?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Chemo.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Martin Hernandez?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Found Jesus.

               Handsome Rob stops Charlie.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want a civilian to screw 
                         this up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has the skill. And the motivation.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Exactly. She's emotional. You know 
                         what happens when emotion gets into 
                         it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's emotional for all of us at this 
                         point. Don't kid yourself.

               INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

               RICHARD WORTH has his back to the bar. He's a blue blood 
               trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a 
               Ferrari.

                                     RICHARD
                         It's all in my patented sideways 
                         glance. Like this...

               He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date.

                                     RICHARD
                         I hit each woman on the jury with 
                         one of these. We make contact. And I 
                         know exactly what they're doing. 
                         Undressing me with their eyes.

                                     STELLA
                         I see...

               What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, 
               "Excuse me." Nightmare continues...

                                     RICHARD
                         The case is all but won. That's why 
                         in jury selection I choose as many 
                         women as possible. Except lesbians, 
                         of course. I can tell in sixty seconds 
                         if they're a lesbian. Want to know 
                         how I know?

                                     STELLA
                         If they don't undress you with their 
                         eyes?

                                     RICHARD
                         Precisely. Like that waitress right 
                         there. See? She's looking at me right 
                         below my belt. Definitely not a 
                         lesbian.

               A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella 
               notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper 
               is all the way down. She smiles.

                                     STELLA
                         Your fly.

                                     RICHARD
                         I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait 
                         until later tonight.

               Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking 
               Richard's suit in red wine.

                                     BUSBOY
                         Oh, man. I'm sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         You should be. Moron. What the hell's 
                         wrong with you?

                                     BUSBOY
                         It was an accident. I'm very sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         Where's the manager? Richard Worth 
                         is not paying to have his suit 
                         cleaned. Damn.
                              (to Stella)
                         I'm going to... I don't believe this.

               He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he 
               was occupying empties, Charlie fills it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think your date's going pretty 
                         well, what do you think?

               She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you mean? I come here all 
                         the time.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of 
                         crowd. See that gentleman there, he 
                         sentenced me to 90 days in county 
                         once. We need to talk.

                                     STELLA
                         No, you need to listen. I want you 
                         to leave. Got it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, I paid valet parking prices to 
                         get in here, not to mention a twenty 
                         spot to the busboy to spill that 
                         drink on Mister Zipper.

                                     STELLA
                         You -- I don't believe this. You 
                         paid someone to spill that drink?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Actually, you paid for it.

               Charlie returns her wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Didn't notice it was me who bumped 
                         into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I 
                         was hoping we could get to know each 
                         other a little better before we leave 
                         for Los Angeles. I already booked 
                         your flight.

                                     STELLA
                         You truly are a fatuous, odious man.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have no idea what you just said, 
                         but I like the sound of it.

                                     STELLA
                         Well maybe you'll understand this. 
                         Hit the road, Jack --

                                     CHARLIE
                         Charlie --

                                     STELLA
                         Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause 
                         I'll kick you in the nuts so hard 
                         that your voice will be as high as 
                         my heels.

               She means it, too.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm beginning to worry about this 
                         whole relationship.

                                     STELLA
                         I'll let you in on a secret. You 
                         can't have a relationship with a 
                         pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind 
                         of thief.

               Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing 
               is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he 
               uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         John wasn't just a man I crewed up 
                         with, he was my friend, he was the 
                         closest thing to a father I ever 
                         had. I wish to God I could bring him 
                         back. But all I can do is go after 
                         this guy, the guy that killed him, 
                         and hit him where he lives.

               She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, 
               they're interrupted by --

                                     RICHARD
                         Everything alright, Stella?

               He's back, red wine splotched on his suit.

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was 
                         just saying goodbye.

               But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into 
               to him...

                                     RICHARD
                         Can I help you with something?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you 
                         with my eyes.

               And with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile.

               EXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT

               She comes home, having shed her date.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't 
               looked at for years. She opens it.

               Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her 
               in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He lies in bed, can't sleep. His phone rings. He picks up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

               She's on the other end of the line.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm in this for one thing, Charlie, 
                         and one thing only. I want to see 
                         the look on his face when his gold 
                         is gone. He took my father from me, 
                         I'm taking this; it's the best I can 
                         do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Stella's Mini passes, weaves, tucks in between cars. She 
               drives like a madman.

               INT. MINI (SPEEDING)

               Charlie feels like he's inside a video game.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I see Drive Defensively is your motto.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let 
                         me down.

               She slaps the dashboard of her car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         By the way you drive, I'm not 
                         surprised you named your car after a 
                         bottle of whiskey. Left.

                                     STELLA
                         Jack Daniels was chief engineer of 
                         the Mini. And I drive it exactly the 
                         way it was meant to be driven.

               She whips down the avenue.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Another left.

               She hangs a left.

                                     STELLA
                         We're going in circles. Who's tailing 
                         you this week?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The possibilities are endless.

               EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Mini parks in the middle of the huge, empty lot that 
               surrounds Veterans Field, home of the Philadelphia Phillies.

               INT. MINI

               She looks around...

                                     STELLA
                         Where are they?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're a little early. I didn't expect 
                         us to get here quite that fast. 
                         There...

               A Vespa pulls into the lot, headed their way. It's Lyle.

               Charlie starts the introductions.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really 
                         invented Napster...

                                                              QUICK CUT TO:

               INT. DORM ROOM - NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY - 1999 - NIGHT

               Below a Metallica poster, Lyle has fallen asleep on his desk.

               His roommate, Napster creator SHAWN FANNING, recognizable in 
               his trademark baseball cap, sneaks a peek at Lyle's computer.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         At least that's how Lyle tells it.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. MINI - DAY

               And now they see a monster pick-up truck bouncing into the 
               lot, MUSIC THUMPING from its Alpine at ear-bleeding levels.

                         Half-Ear. Explosives. He lost fifty

               INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL BATHROOM - 1990 - DAY

               A 10 year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall.

               BOOM! Water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him.

                         One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many.

               Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing.

                                     KID
                         That was rad!

                         Wha'?

               INT. MINI - DAY

               And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car 
               streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves 
               coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. 
               Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious 
               custom work done to it.

                         Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He 
                         once drove all the way to L.A. just 
                         so he could set the record for longest 
                         freeway chase.

               Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out 
               his open window --

               We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind 
               the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled

                         Smashed the mark by twelve minutes.

               We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news 
               helicopter camera.

                         He got a hundred and ten love letters 
                         sent to his jail cell from women who 
                         saw him on TV.

                         And what about you?

                         I've been a thief since I had baby 
                         teeth.

               INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

               SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence 
               by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY.

                                     BULLY
                         Cough it up, Charlie!

               Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in 
               a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, 
               laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd 
               grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye.

                                     CLASSMATE
                         So much for lunch.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         You need a dollar?

                                     CLASSMATE
                         I thought he took your last one.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         He did.

               Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed 
               from the bully.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         But I got lots more now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Doors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella. 
               Charlie gets right down to business.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Stella. She's working with 
                         us on this one. IDs?

               Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses.

                         I don't even have a cool nickname.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Enough of this sewing-circle shit. 
                         Phones.

               Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their 
               old phones.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak says these are clean as 
                         a whistle. He also got us four dozen 
                         internal chips with different numbers. 
                         Change out the chips twice a day.

               As Charlie hands out airline tickets --

                         We travel to L.A. separately.

                                     LYLE
                         You still haven't told us the most 
                         important thing. What exactly is the 
                         job, Charlie? And who exactly is 
                         she?

               Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Stella Bridger. And we're 
                         finishing the job that we started in 
                         Italy.

               They're a little stunned at first.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Holy shit. It's about time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MONTAGE - LAX - NIGHT

               The crew deplane from five different airplanes, different 
               air carriers.

               They disperse in separate vehicles. See Charlie at Avis, 
               renting a car.

               See Handsome Rob renting a U-Haul panel truck.

               See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus.

               See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red 
               Line.

               See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street. He 
               notices a YOUNG WOMAN HITCHHIKING. For a moment, their eyes 
               connect. She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps 
               through Lyle: if only... But the taxi passes by.

               Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house 
               feel and oceanfront view.

               Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent 
               lobby.

               Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and 
               ironic style. He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the 
               front desk where a performance artist writhes and a DJ spins 
               out rhythmic throbs. Very L.A.

               Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent 
               to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre.

               And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass 
               elevator. Perfect gearhead hotel.

               EXT. SHUTTERS HOTEL - BALCONY - SUNSET

               The five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel 
               room. There's a sweeping view of the Pacific.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We need an in to get a video blueprint 
                         of the interior. We're not going 
                         into this place blind. Half-Ear, you 
                         take the first surveillance shift. 
                         Who goes in, who goes out, levels of

                         You got it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I also want audio surveillance on

                         I'll hack into the phone company's 
                         central office remote observance 
                         monitoring system and fool it into 
                         thinking there's a legal tap on the 
                         line. Reroute the digital copies of 
                         his calls to our own listening post.

                         I'll burn through the night, have it 
                         up and running before morning.

                              (to Handsome Rob)
                         We need to know how long to get from 
                         the house to Union Station downtown.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No problemo.

                         Stella. How much time will you need 
                         with the safe?

                                     STELLA
                         I'll have it open in five minutes 
                         flat.

                         It's not the same as opening a safe 
                         for the cops. Your heart will be 
                         pounding in your ears. Perspiration 
                         on your fingertips. It's a whole 
                         different ball game.

                                     STELLA
                         You get me to the safe, I'll open 
                         it.

               Out over the ocean, the sun is in its death throes, bruising 
               the sky a coiling purple and orange.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac on Oporto Drive in the 
               Hollywood Hills. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood.

               EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - MORNING

               The U-Haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road 
               that overlooks Oporto Drive and Steve's house.

               INT. U-HAUL - MORNING

               It's been converted into their surveillance vehicle, the 
               back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment.

               Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a 
               micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence 
               that surrounds the perimeter of the property.

                                     HALF-EAR
                              (into recorder)
                         We've got an anti-scaling fence. 
                         Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw 
                         won't work. We'll need Nitramon.

               The binoculars SWISH PAN TO a guard booth where a guard keeps 
               an eye on the gate.

                         the holster. Security booth is 
                         accessible and ideal for a triple 
                         charger chemical grenade.

               The binoculars SWISH PAN TO four Rottweilers prowling the 
               grounds.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate 
                         dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. 
                         Because dogs are racist. That's a 
                         natural fact. Someone else deal with 
                         'em.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               A sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the 
               traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING)

               Timing out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the 
               passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going 
               nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Lyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a 
               telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front 
               door.

                                     LYLE

                         fire, and environmental hazards. 
                         Best way around it is to get a back 
                         door password, trip the alarm during 
                         the heist, then call it in as a false 
                         alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

               A HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault 
               opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY

               The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW 
               BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last 
               saw him, his beard shaved away.

               INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

               Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk 
               towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's 
               the first time he's seen Steve in three years.

                                     LYLE

                         15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 
                         to 20 pounds living off our money. 
                         And Handsome Rob, you're going to be 
                         pissed when you see his wheels.

               Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard 
               booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in 
               reverse. The Ferrari zooms away.

               EXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY

               Another route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn 
               lane waiting for the light to change.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of 
               Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up 
               that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late 
               as she makes it through the light but he doesn't.

               He checks his stopwatch. Simmers.

               EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY

               In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, 
               reading a copy of Vogue magazine.

               But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading 
               the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's

               Charlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her 
               car.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (into micro cassette 
                              recorder)
                         Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.

               EXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers 
               the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian 
               named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer 
               that Philly Steak told Charlie about.

                                     YEVHEN
                         You're right on time.

               INT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a 
               conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their 
               way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive --

                                     YEVHEN
                         All those poor bastards out there 
                         putting their life savings in banks 
                         and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do 
                         they think -- that when the collapse 
                         comes they can depend on the 
                         government? I don't think so.

               Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them.

                                     STEVE
                         Is the camera off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Just like you said. I 
                         never tape you, you can see for 
                         yourself.

               Steve sees the red light is off. He lays the duffel bag on a 
               table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with 
               the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one. As Yevhen 
               inspects them --

                                     YEVHEN
                         Governments are nothing more than 
                         puppets on the strings of the 
                         Trilateral Commission with their 
                         twisted gods.

               Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve 
               with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth. As Steve 
               inspects the cash --

                                     YEVHEN
                         I mean, it's so obvious that in a 
                         world where NAFTA can overturn the 
                         Supreme Court, not to mention 
                         Microsoft's nefarious financial 
                         machinations, this, is our only 
                         refuge; gold.

               Steve closes the briefcase.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Plus a little walking around money.

               EXT. 7TH STREET - NIGHT

               A fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic 
               backed up for miles.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               Through night-vision binoculars Charlie sees a (different) 
               security guard open the gate as Steve returns.

               He watches Steve go inside his house. Through the windows, 
               he sees him use a remote to turn on a TV.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - THE NEXT DAY

               A freeway sign says: UNION STATION 1/2 MILE

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               HANDSOME ROB can see the exit up ahead, but traffic is so 
               backed up and going nowhere that it feels like it's a hundred 
               miles away. And it's not even rush hour. Just life in L.A.

               Idling on the freeway, he looks at the drivers in the cars 
               beside him. He sees a businesswoman reading the Wall Street 
               Journal. Sees a man with his finger deep, deep up his nose.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Where's a grenade launcher when you 
                         need one?

               EXT. YAMASHIRO RESTAURANT - DAY

               Our crew walks along the pathways of Japanese gardens that 
               wind along outside the restaurant. It's a breathtaking view 
               from high in the Hollywood Hills. Some tourists take in the 
               vista.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Doesn't matter what time it is. It's 
                         either bad traffic, peak traffic, or 
                         slit-your-wrists traffic.

                         I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a

                         What's your guesstimate?

                         If we had all green lights, fourteen 
                         minutes. But in the twenty times 
                         I've done it, the average is thirty-
                         two minutes, with a top time of fifty 
                         minutes.

                         Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.

               They don't know where Charlie is going with this, but they've 
               been around him long enough to know it's going somewhere.

                         When cars first started catching on, 
                         workers on tall ladders would use 
                         these swiveling colored boards for 
                         traffic signals. Now whenever 
                         Rockefeller would take the drive 
                         from his mansion to his office on 
                         Wall Street, the workers would make 
                         sure that he got green boards all 
                         the way.

                         We'll never get by the guard unless 
                         they're certain it's legit. I'm 
                         thinking cable TV. We cut his cable, 
                         he calls the cable company. We show 
                         up. Send a cable technician into the 
                         house with a pinhole video camera 
                         while we get a feed through an RF 
                         antenna.

                         Who plays cable technician? Steve 
                         thinks we're all dead.

               But Stella knows that's not exactly true. He doesn't think 
               Stella is dead; he doesn't know her at all.

                                     STELLA
                         If you're all dead, I guess I'm the 
                         man for the job.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE - PARKING LOT - EVENING

               Service trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting 
               out, finishing their shifts.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY)

               Handsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his 
               digital camera at the exiting workers.

                         I'm telling you. He claims he named 
                         it Napster because his hair is so 
                         nappy underneath that cap of his. 
                         But I know the real reason. It's 
                         because I was NAPPING when he stole 
                         the idea from me. I should've been 
                         on the cover of Wired magazine.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Would you clam up. You'd give a 
                         woodpecker a headache.

                                     LYLE
                         I'm the Napster.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: 
                         cable chick.

               They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck.

               Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work 
               shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast.

                                     LYLE
                         Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she 
                         calls the other one.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         And it's such a mystery why you don't 
                         have a girlfriend.

                                     LYLE
                         I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately 
                         even though the relationship ceased 
                         in an objective reality, it's still 
                         going on in my mind.
                              (tapping his head)
                         That woman's lived in here rent-free 
                         for four years.

               Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky.

                                     LYLE
                         Okay. All we need now is a work shirt 
                         like this one and a service truck 
                         like that one. You think Stella will 
                         be able to pull it off?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I have my doubts, but there's no 
                         talking to Charlie.

                                     LYLE
                         Maybe he's been inserting his hard 
                         drive into her software. Clouds the 
                         judgment.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He knows better than to mix business 
                         with pleasure.
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Only I'm allowed to do that.

                                     LYLE
                         Where you going?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         To get a work shirt and a service 
                         truck.

               Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a 
               conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being 
               said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is 
               Handsome Rob for a reason.

               INT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, 
               that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the 
               bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. 
               Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His 
               eyes flash open.

               He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her 
               pants and removes her key chain.

               He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: 
               he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against 
               the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges.

               He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past 
               her panties, past her bra and.

               He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the 
               impression on the candle wax.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN

               Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other 
               workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the 
               door to the cable truck and gets in.

               EXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING

               The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the 
               back where they can't be seen.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING

               The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street 
               from Steve's house.

               Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a 
               sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable 
               wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers 
               to disconnect one of the cables.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the 
               remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but 
               snow.

               He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV.

               The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom 
               button on his telephone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               A SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         What can I do for you, Mister 
                         Frezelli?

                                     STEVE
                         The cable's out. See if you can get 
                         someone over here to fix it'.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes, sir.

               He finds the number and dials.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (PARKED) - MORNING

               Lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guard's call 
               that's being routed to his laptop. Then he takes off his 
               headphones and tells Charlie and Stella:

                                     LYLE
                         Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak 
                         version of Purple Haze before.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When's the appointment?

                                     LYLE
                         Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.

               Charlie dials a number on his cell phone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               The security guard answers the phone.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hello.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. 
                         I understand your service is out and 
                         an appointment was set up for 
                         Thursday.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well we have a technician working in 
                         your area who finished with an 
                         appointment earlier than expected. 
                         Will someone be there for the next 
                         hour?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Sure. That'd be great.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Our technician will see you then. 
                         Have a nice day.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         You too.

               Charlie hangs up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's check the camera.

                                     LYLE
                         Stella, you're going patriotic today.

               Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt. Then he 
               hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor 
               via an RF antenna: the POV of the pin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's got cable lines in the kitchen, 
                         living room, bedroom and a cable 
                         modem on the computer in the office. 
                         Try to get a 360 look at each room. 
                         And walk slowly or the image will 
                         streak.

               Lyle hands her some papers.

                                     LYLE
                         I printed these up to look like 
                         paperwork from Adelphia. When you're 
                         done, ask him to sign and date the 
                         bottom.

               Stella looks very tense.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How you doing?

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. I'm fine.

               Charlie seems amused by that answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what fine, stands for? Fucked-
                         up, Insecure --

               Stella joins in with him...

                                     STELLA & CHARLIE
                         Neurotic and Emotional.

               They look at each other a moment... and smile.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               While the others deal with the cable, Handsome Rob and Half- 
               Ear drive down Sunset.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Here's our spot.

               They pull up in front of a strip joint.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Girls girls girls.

               Half-Ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in 
               the glove compartment. Handsome Rob gives him a questioning 
               look.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.

               INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

               Outside the doorway of a back room they're frisked by a BURLY 
               MAN. He's very thorough, digging hard into their crotches.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                              (scowls)
                         Y'got a great job.

                                     BURLY MAN
                         Pays the rent, asshole. You got a 
                         problem, talk to Skinny Pete.

               He opens the door to the --

               INT. BACK ROOM

               Where we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE 
               EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the 
               room.

               His catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Philly Steak sent you?

               His voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort 
               just for this guy to get out the words.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's right.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         So was I right-on about the gold 
                         bricks or what?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's really not what I'm here to 
                         talk about. Philly Steak said you 
                         could get us some supplies.

               The fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins 
               colliding like a train wreck.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         What do you need?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon 
                         primer. Detonating cord. Two triple 
                         charger chemical grenades. Launcher.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nine p.m.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Should we hang here? Check out the 
                         dancers?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nothing's going down here. I don't 
                         shit in my own yard, do you?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No, but I take a whizz off the deck 
                         sometimes.

               With his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing 
               with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Five thousand dollars. And don't be 
                         late.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY

               Looking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees 
               the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a 
               button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING)

               Stella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her 
               features. Lyle is hidden in the back.

               She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded 
               by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth 
               outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention 
               to --

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

               where Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs 
               immediately back off.

               Stella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at 
               her.

               She comes face to face with the man who killed her father.

                                     STEVE
                         It's all right. They won't bother 
                         you now.

               She's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this 
               off.

                                     STELLA
                         It's okay. I'm used to running into 
                         all sorts of dogs on my job.

               He holds out a hand.

                                     STEVE
                         I'm Steve.

                                     STELLA
                         Becky.

               She shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch 
               hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a 
               moment.

                                     STELLA
                         You want to show me the problem?

                                     STEVE
                         Yeah. Course. This way.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

               She enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a 
               full sweep of the entryway.

                                     STELLA
                         I'd like to check the cable modem 
                         first.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE REPAIR TRUCK - SAME TIME

               Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole 
               camera and hears them talking through his headphones.

               INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

               Steve leads Stella down the marbled hall...

                                     STEVE
                         I'll show you.

               They step into the --

                                     OFFICE
                         She turns her body so the mini-lens 
                         can stare at the gleaming black 
                         Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes 
                         up to his desk and pretends to work 
                         on the cable line that feeds into 
                         his computer.

               He stares at her as she bends down...

                                     STEVE
                         The cable guy who hooked this up 
                         weighed about 300 pounds, didn't 
                         wear any underwear, and his pants 
                         slung a little too low if you know 
                         what I mean.

               She tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his 
               words.

                                     STELLA
                         There we go. Now onto the TVs.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE TRUCK - DAY

               Lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks 
               down it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               He escorts her inside. She works on the cable connection to 
               the plasma TV. Finishes.

                                     STEVE
                         Is it fixed?

                                     STELLA
                         Turn it on and see.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - SAME TIME

               Back at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable.

               Wearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle --

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Now.

               Charlie reconnects the cable just as --

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Steve turns on the TV and the picture is --

                                     STEVE
                         Perfect.

                                     STELLA
                         Then it looks like you're all set.

               Steve stares at her a moment.

                                     STEVE
                         Have we met before?

               She's hoping to get out as quickly as she can.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so. Sign here, please.

               She hands him the paperwork and a pen. He signs it.

                                     STELLA
                         Date.

                                     STEVE
                         You read my mind.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh, no. I meant that I need you to 
                         put the date by your signature. It's 
                         the 26th.

                                     STEVE
                         I know what you meant.
                              (he smiles)
                         This might seem a little sudden, 
                         but... would you like to have dinner 
                         with me?

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think that'd be a very good 
                         idea.

                                     STEVE
                         Why? Is there some kind of cable-
                         rule against dating customers?

                                     STELLA
                         No, it's my rule. I don't accept 
                         dates from men I've just met. I've 
                         only known you five minutes.

                                     STEVE
                         Then I guess I'll have to sabotage 
                         my cable over and over again until 
                         you get to know me better.

               He's being charming, and she has to act like he is being 
               charming, but she really wants to throw-up.

                                     STEVE
                         Look, I'm just talking about dinner. 
                         Friday night. It's no big deal. If 
                         you don't like me, you never have to 
                         see me again. You know I'm not going 
                         to stop until you say yes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

               Stella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle 
               are in the back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know it was tough in there.

                                     STELLA
                         He touched my hand. And he came-on 
                         to me. That slimy, disgusting man 
                         came onto me and I had to pretend 
                         that I liked it.

               Stella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and 
               Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection 
               in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her 
               cheek. She wipes it away.

                                     STELLA
                         You do know what this means... I've 
                         created our window of opportunity.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. When Steve leaves Friday 
                         night, we go in. By the time he 
                         realizes you've stood him up, we'll 
                         be long gone with the gold.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT

               A different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the 
               gut: you don't belong here.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               Handsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Skinny Pete.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         The guy makes Jabba the Hut look 
                         like a spokesman for the Subway 
                         Sandwiches' diet.

               They pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete 
               sent them to.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What do you think?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'm trying not to.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the 
               paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in 
               response and they go inside.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Climbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, 
               violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a 
               door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. 
               The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is 
               inside.

               They go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for 
               just a peek. He sees the goods.

               Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the 
               door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the 
               other side of the door and disappears.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of 
               the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Drive slow. We crash and we're a 
                         crater.

               They get into the car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob keys the ignition.

               The beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE 
               step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's 
               door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass.

               Half-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against 
               the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches 
               the weapon.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         What'd you put in the trunk?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Suitcase.

               The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Just gimme the keys before I pop a 
                         cap in your head.

               Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it 
               over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted 
               floor.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Hurry up!

               Half-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an 
               eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see 
               him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, 
               and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes 
               through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior 
               of the door.

               The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his 
               other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns 
               it.

               The other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car 
               with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass 
               shatters.

               INT. TRUNK OF THE CAR

               Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with 
               streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the 
               suitcase filled with explosives.

               EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife.

               His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's 
               going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets 
               whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the 
               time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the 
               pavement.

               The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over.

               The U-Haul is waiting for them.

               They get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear 
               sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch 
               closer and they would've been a crater.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Christ.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               They get in with the suitcase. Charlie is behind the wheel, 
               he's been waiting for them. He hits the gas. They take off, 
               leaving the shot-up rental car behind.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like that went without a hitch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               An edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house 
               plays on Lyle's laptop. The crew is huddled around.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle, what's the distance from the 
                         front door to the vault?

               Lyle doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle?

               Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He only answers to The Napster now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm not calling you The Napster.

                                     LYLE
                         You call him Half-Ear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That wasn't my idea.

                                     LYLE
                         And him, Handsome Rob.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's only cause he is Handsome 
                         Rob.

                                     LYLE
                         And I'm The Napster.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How far?

                         Five hundred yards.

                                     CHARLIE
                         So here's the riddle. How do we get 
                         over a ton of gold from the vault to 
                         the getaway car?

                         How wide is the hallway?

               The video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop.

               Lyle calculates:

               She's driving. Pure concentration. Then:

               Tires spinning over a marble floor. Then:

               The sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper. Then:

               The thin car is like a missile firing RIGHT DOWN STEVE'S 
               HALLWAY, a hair-raising fit.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

                         We could rumble right up the front 
                         steps, bring the getaway car right 
                         to the vault, and then straight to 
                         Union Station.

               Handsome Rob likes it.

                         We'll need three to hold the gold.

               EXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY

               Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, 
               a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and 
               feel.

               Half-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another.

               INT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - SAME TIME

               In the background, a large window overlooks the lot.

               Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting 
               while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S. 
                         Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 
                         in 4.2.

                                     COUNTER BABE
                         As long as it's a convertible -- I 
                         always like to have my top down.

               At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half-
               Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT 
               INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit.

                                     COUNTER BABE
                         Do you know them?

               They get out of their cars and start yelling at each other.

                         Never seen 'em before in my life.

               Yevhen unlocks another door.

                                     YEVHEN
                         You're early.

                                     STEVE
                         And I'm in a hurry, okay?

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - NIGHT

               It doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen 
               still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course the Florida vote rigging 
                         was a CIA and Mob operation.

                                     STEVE
                              (with total disinterest)
                         That a fact?

                                     YEVHEN
                         You want facts? Fact: CIA officials 
                         were allowed free -- and illegal -- 
                         access to official election material.

               Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once 
               again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 
               pounds.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Now given the sordid history in Miami 
                         of joint ventures between Central 
                         Intelligence and the Mob, which led 
                         to the unsuccessful attempts to kill 
                         Fidel Castro and the successful 
                         assassination of your President John 
                         F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises 
                         numerous red flags.

                                     STEVE
                         And I'd love to hear more about it, 
                         but like I said...

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, we'll have you out in 
                         no time. The cash is on its way.

               Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right.

                                     STEVE
                         On its way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         My cousin is bringing it over.

                                     STEVE
                         Your cousin?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Yes. Cousin Mashkov.

                                     STEVE
                         He's on his way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, he will be here any 
                         minute.

               Steve looks up to the security camera.

                                     STEVE
                         The tape's off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Believe me, he doesn't 
                         want to be on video, either.

                                     STEVE
                         Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, 
                         that I never wanted to meet with 
                         anyone but you?

               Yevhen sweats a bit.

                                     YEVHEN
                         I know. But it's his cash. He uses 
                         me to launder money. I'm just a 
                         middleman.

                                     STEVE
                         And a middleman is supposed to stay 
                         in the middle.

                                     YEVHEN
                         But you were early. Please. Don't 
                         worry. It will be fine. My cousin's 
                         a cool guy. Like I am.

                                     STEVE
                         What you are, is a Dixie cup.

               Yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented 
               or insulted.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Dixie cup?

               Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one 
               of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's 
               face, shattering his jaw.

               Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again 
               and rams it down onto his head with an ugly THUD.

               And again.

               And again.

               He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and 
               places it back in his duffle bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - TEN MINUTES LATER

               Yevhen's Ukrainian cousin, MASHKOV, stares down at the corpse. 
               Steve is long gone.

               Mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting 
               equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a 
               look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he 
               couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where --

               His boss, DANYA, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a 
               bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table. They speak in a 
               colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we SUBTITLE.

                                     MASHKOV
                         My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.

                                     DANYA
                         By who?

                                     MASHKOV
                         That's what I'm going to find out.

               They stop talking for a moment as one of the "ACTRESSES" 
               comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself 
               a bowl of cereal. She puts her hand on Danya's leg. She's 
               young and it's a disturbing image and we RECOGNIZE HER: she's 
               the HITCHHIKER who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa 
               Street when he first arrived in L.A.

               Danya goes back to speaking SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

                                     DANYA
                         And what will you do when you find 
                         this piece of shit who killed your 
                         cousin?

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'll hack off his limbs and bury him 
                         while he's still alive.

                                     DANYA
                         Okay. But now we should stop talking 
                         Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl.
                              (switching to accented 
                              ENGLISH)
                         How are you tonight, Karen?

                                     KAREN
                         Hungry.

                                     DANYA
                         Then eat your Frosted Flakes.

                                     KAREN
                              (like Tony the Tiger)
                         They're grrrreat!

               Danya laughs pleasantly.

                                     DANYA
                         Such a perfect girl.

               But as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on 
               her face.

               INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one 
               blue. Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under 
               the hoods. Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing 
               away. Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the 
               Minis' trunks as Charlie enters --

                                     CHARLIE
                         How are our matchbox cars?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Souped.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't let their size fool you. These 
                         were rally cars back in the day. 135 
                         mph, 155 horsepower --

                                     LYLE
                         Do I get to drive one?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No.

                                     LYLE
                         Why not?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Because you can't navigate your way 
                         out of a parking lot. Here's your 
                         ride.

               He pulls a blanket off a Vespa. Lyle points at Half-Ear.

                                     LYLE
                         But he ran into me.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He's not driving either.
                              (to Stella)
                         You ever got a speeding ticket?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's put it this way: I can only 
                         get insurance through companies that 
                         advertise on TV at 3:00 in the 
                         morning.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         You drive. I drive. Charlie drives.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I got us spots for three cars on a 
                         car carrier and five first class 
                         seats. Train 59 from Union Station 
                         to New Orleans.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's N'Or'lins, Yankee.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's the word on Rockefeller?

                                     LYLE
                         The Traffic Control Center is on the 
                         top floor of a building on Olympic 
                         and Grand. They get their data from 
                         pavement loop detectors and video 
                         image vehicle detectors. That info 
                         is fused together by specially 
                         designed algorithms to predict traffic 
                         conditions and control the traffic 
                         lights. So all I have to do now is 
                         change the data by creating my own 
                         algorithm.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What can I do to help?

                                     LYLE
                         I need to hard-wire into the 
                         mainframes.

               EXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

               Housed in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and 
               Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the 
               rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle.

               OUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the 
               lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of 
               steps into the 

               INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT

               From an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill 
               and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent.

               INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT

               Charlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path 
               illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight.

               INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

               A high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the 
               large traffic information monitors that display multiple 
               images.

               OUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then 
               BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the --

               OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

               Where the 70" tall mainframe computers are housed and running. 
               We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie 
               and Lyle have already snuck inside.

               They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the 
               mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the 
               computers. The laptop's screen lights up.

               Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the 
               mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing 
               box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby 
               shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels.

               He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the 
               filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with 
               his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of 
               thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors.

               Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher 
               bandwidth than the rest us.

                                     LYLE
                         B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's 
                         linear discriminant function 
                         coefficients, SpdRat is the speed 
                         ratio, and TTratio is the travel 
                         time ratio.

               Their motto: "Never closed. Never without a customer!" The 
               place has the same decor as it did 75 years ago. It's also a 
               spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD 
               TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where 
               Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides 
               over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen.

                         Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's 
                         guys picked her up hitchhiking 
                         downtown.

                         I needed a fast answer.

                         And I'm the Shell Answer Man. A guy 
                         who works the counter at your cousin's 
                         shop told me that someone named Skinny

                         gold bricks with the face of a 
                         Balinese girl on them. Same gold 
                         bricks your cousin was buying.

               preens in front of the three sided full length mirror, 
               adorning himself in the most expensive fashion, that he is a

               HIS POV

               The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the 
               biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars 
               and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, 
               launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's 
               house in the midst of this.

                         You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his 
                         jokes. You need him to ask you out 
                         again.

               INT. AGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A posh restaurant. As OUR CAMERA FINDS Stella and Steve, she 
               is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the 
               date. They're sitting at an intimate table.

                                     STELLA
                         You really make laugh.

               He takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think 
               it is.

                         So here's what I have lined up for 
                         after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep. 
                         The Ferrari always gets me to the 
                         front of the line. We'll do a little 
                         dancing...

                                     STELLA
                         Not tonight. I don't want to be out 
                         late.

                                     STEVE
                         Why the curfew?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's just say I've made some wrong 
                         calls in the past. I like to take 
                         things slow, cautious. Next time...

                                     STEVE
                         I understand. You have nothing to 
                         worry about. You can trust me.

                                     STELLA
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.

               That saying strikes Steve.

                                     STEVE
                         That's an interesting saying.

                                     STELLA
                         What?

               He looks at her closely, really closely.

                                     STEVE
                         There's only person I've ever heard 
                         say that. Used to say it all the 
                         time.

               This worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it 
               from her father.

                                     STELLA
                         Who was that?

               Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like 
               a vise.

                                     STEVE
                         A man named John Bridger. Where did 
                         you pick up that phrase?

                                     STELLA
                         Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting 
                         me.

                                     STEVE
                         John Bridger was a thief. And he had 
                         a daughter. About your age. He told 
                         me that she took over a safe and 
                         lock company that he used as a front.

                                     STELLA
                         Let go of my wrist. What is wrong 
                         with you? It's just a saying.

               Steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd 
               think this was pleasant dinner conversation.

                                     STEVE
                         No wonder I liked you right away. 
                         Just like I liked your old man, right 
                         up until the moment I shot him in 
                         the head. Now tell me who you're 
                         working with and tell me the plan. 
                         Do it now or we'll go for a ride and 
                         I'll break every bone in your body.

               Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. It shatters 
               on the floor. An emergency signal...

               Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the 
               table.

               Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years 
               ago standing before him, very much alive.

               They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a 
               tense and pointed talk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Something wrong, Steve? You look 
                         like you want to call Ghostbusters.

               Half-Ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         She's coming with us. You got a 
                         problem with that?

                                     STEVE
                         Fine by me. But it's you that has 
                         the problem.

                                     LYLE
                         How do you figure?

                                     STEVE
                         You've just blown the one thing you 
                         had going in your favor, the element 
                         of surprise. And I was surprised.
                              (he laughs unpleasantly)
                         Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys 
                         come out of the woodwork. For a minute 
                         I thought maybe you were ghosts. But 
                         you're screwed now.
                              (an arrogant sneer a 
                              Half-Ear)
                         Did you figure out how to take care 
                         of my security guard? I'll hire five 
                         more.
                              (at Lyle)
                         You know how to bypass my alarm 
                         system? I'll have a new one installed 
                         tomorrow.
                              (at Handsome Rob)
                         Does it tear you up inside seeing 
                         what car I drive? I'll buy a matching 
                         one in red.
                              (at Stella)
                         You think you can crack my safe? 
                         You'll end up the same way as your 
                         dad.
                              (then to Charlie, all 
                              smiles)
                         Looks like Good Time Charlie's got 
                         the blues.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can wear that shit-eating grin 
                         on your face, but I know under that 
                         Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat. 
                         And you're not going to sleep a minute 
                         tonight. Cause you thought you'd 
                         gotten away with it free and clear. 
                         You thought you'd gotten rid of us. 
                         You're the one who's screwed. Right 
                         to the wall.

                                     STEVE
                         Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart 
                         you every step of the way. And this 
                         time, I'll bury you myself.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (taking the challenge)
                         Get more guards. Change the alarm. 
                         Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be 
                         here. Sleep tight.

               Charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes. The others 
               follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STRIP CLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is 
               dragged inside at gunpoint. Five Ukrainians armed with MAC-
               11 machine pistols storm the room where Skinny Pete works.

               Mashkov walks behind the posse. He carries a duffel bag. He 
               takes in the sight of the fattest man he's ever seen.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (in accented English)
                         Do you know who I am?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         You work for Danya.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Yes. And you are gonna be straight 
                         with me and everything's gonna be 
                         okay. You fuck with me, I will be 
                         ruthless.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         I understand.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I don't want you to understand. I 
                         want you to overstand.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Overstand... Okay.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Because if you don't overstand, I 
                         will use this.

               Mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a 
               short-handled ax. Skinny Pete sees dried blood on the blade.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Someone was asking about gold bars 
                         with a Balinese girl's face on them. 
                         I want the name of this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHUTTER'S ON THE BEACH - MORNING

               The sun shines over the ocean and the hotel.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM

               The crew is gathered. Lyle, monitoring digital surveillance 
               on his laptop, takes off his headphones.

                                     LYLE
                         Well we scared him alright. He's 
                         flying the coop. His security guard 
                         called Brink's Armored Car Service 
                         to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his 
                         house, then JetClub to confirm a 
                         MD11 cargo plane departing from the 
                         Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Confirmed? How'd we miss the first 
                         calls?

                                     LYLE
                         They must have been cellular. The 
                         cargo plane is being chartered to 
                         Mexico City.

                         Once the charter's in the air, he 
                         could change the flight path to 
                         anywhere. And good-bye gold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast. This is good news for 
                         us.

                         Good news?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sometimes when you're up to your ass 
                         in alligators you forget that you 
                         started off trying to drain the swamp.

                         Meaning what the fuck?

                         We've been trying to get to the gold 
                         in the safe. Now the safe is coming 
                         to us. We'll boost it in transit.

               He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before 
               sunrise.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Charlie. He could take a dozen 
                         different routes to the airport and 
                         we have no idea which one. We can't 
                         take out an armored truck during 
                         rush hour.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're already set to do it. Napster: 
                         how would you like to create the 
                         biggest traffic jam in the history 
                         of Los Angeles?

                                     LYLE
                         Keep talking.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You gridlock every route except the 
                         one we choose. Force the truck to go 
                         exactly where we want it to go.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         But where do we want it? We can't 
                         shoot it out with armed guards in a 
                         Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we 
                         pulled it off, the cops would be all 
                         over us, chasing us all the way to 
                         Union Station. We're outmanned and 
                         outgunned.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But not outsmarted.

               Charlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in 
               horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and 
               twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." That 
               describes Charlie right now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll do it like the Italian job. 
                         We'll make thirty million in gold 
                         drop out of sight.

               They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This 
               throws them all off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who else has this number?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         No one but us.

               It's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it.

                         Do what?

               OUR CAMERA TRACKS AROUND to Philly Steak's face which is 
               weathered and as leathery as a football. An old school crook.

                         Christ's sakes.

                         Listen to me. You've gotta get out 
                         of L.A. Now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What're you talking about? We didn't 
                         clip anybody.

                         Well Skinny Pete just called me. 
                         Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct 
                         impression that you did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why does he think that?

                                     PHILLY STEAK
                         Because you wanted, to know about 
                         the gold with the Balinese Girl. 
                         Plus I guess Pete was under duress. 
                         This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul 
                         Fucking Bunyan.

                         Do you know how to get in touch with 
                         him?

                                     PHILLY STEAK
                         Yeah but... 

                                     CHARLIE
                         Maybe there's a way we can play this 
                         to our advantage.

                                     PHILLY STEAK
                         Are you out of your mind? Listen to 
                         me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. 
                         Cause if there's one thing I know, 
                         it's that you never mess with Mother 
                         Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother-
                         fucking Ukrainians.

               machine pistols plus an M4 carbine with a 40mm grenade 
               launcher mounted beneath the barrel. Mashkov enters the room 
               and tells the others in SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

               INT. DANYA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               The home where the porno was made. Karen, wearing a backpack 
               stuffed with her only belongings, creeps into the kitchen 
               with two 3/4" videotapes in hand.

               She sets them down on the counter. They say MASTER TAPE on 
               the labels. She opens the microwave oven. Puts the tapes 
               inside. Sets the timer for 60 minutes at the highest level 
               and presses the start button.

               As the videotapes start to cook, we watch Karen flee out the 
               door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The U-Haul is parked on the side of the noisy, congested 
               boulevard. A large metal sheet is now mounted on the side of 
               the panel truck.

               HIGH ANGLE. Parked behind the U-Haul are two of the Minis 
               and Lyle's Vespa. We see traffic flowing through the busy 
               intersection next to the vehicles. Then WE BOOM DOWN, really 
               fast, right into the black pavement and --

               THROUGH THE DARKNESS and out the other side, so we are now

               where Half-Ear is at work, mounting Nitramon primer to the

                         of high school.

                         Quit going to strip clubs. Went to

                         is all.

                         I didn't want to say anything to the 
                         guys.

               There's a RUMBLING SOUND in the distance.

                         Secret's safe with me.

               The RUMBLING grows unbearable as a Metro roars closer, 
               headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel. They press themselves 
               into a crevice in the wall.

               With a ROAR and a gust of wind, the Metro howls by. It makes 
               their jaws clatter.

               Handsome Rob's Mini is parked on the side of the winding 
               road. Using binoculars, he looks down onto Oporto Drive at 
               Steve's house. Into his headset:

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Everything's quiet here. Over.

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

               The Nitramon is applied. Half-Ear closes his eyes. Charlie 
               observes him a moment.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You okay?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Ah huh. Just need a moment's 
                         meditation.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm about to insert a wire into a 
                         detonator tube and if the wire touches 
                         the sides of tube, we'll be blown to 
                         Kingdom Come. Best to be at one with 
                         yourself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take all the time you need.

               Another moment, then Half-Ear sets to work. Charlie holds a 
               mini-flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator. Very 
               carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube. Remember, the wire 
               must not touch the sides.

               The wire is half-way in when a LARGE SPIDER drops onto his 
               hand. Frozen, he ponders this.

               Charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do.

               Half-Ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just 
               a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then --

               He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over 
               the spider, comes back up. Finishes inserting the wire.

               Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy 
               leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks 
               it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall.

               Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         My work here is done.

               Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on 
               Steve's house from the higher vantage point.

               HIS POV

               The front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are 
               let inside and head up the driveway.

               But then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded 
               by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by 
               motorcycles turns into the driveway.

               The caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down 
               the driveway. The Ferrari follows behind.

               Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports

                         truck has the gold?

               Charlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always 
               comes up with an idea.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can monitor the traffic video 
                         cameras from your laptop, right?

                         Where's the first camera the trucks 
                         will go past?

               Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of 
               Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving 
               under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is 
               mounted to.

                         Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to 
                         cross that.

                         The weight of the gold will lower 
                         the suspension on the truck.

               He unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the 
               next armored truck in line. FREEZE. The top of this truck 
               also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign.

               At the same time, we see Charlie get out of the U-Haul and

               The motorcycles following the Brink's come to a sudden stop.

               The motorcycle guards watch the smoke clear. The armored 
               truck has vanished! Vaporized in the gridlock! Gone!

               Pandemonium. People scatter. A man jumps out of his BMW and 
               sprints away from the explosion.

               Lyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle: 
               the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him...

               The sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked 
               just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition.

               At the same time, the motorcycle guards climb off their bikes. 
               Draw semi-automatic handguns. Result: more madness Bystanders 
               flee.

               The BMW tears out of there, Lyle behind the wheel.

               after her.

               INT. LAPD HELICOPTER (FLYING)

               An LAPD PILOT swoops in, barking out instructions to police 
               cars converging on the scene.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               Turning onto Exposition, the motorcycle in pursuit, the 
               chopper overhead.

               His red Mini jumps a curve, now on a wide sidewalk, 
               accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians 
               flatten themselves against a high-rise in fear.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He sees someone give him the finger. Mutters:

                                     CHARLIE
                         If you don't like how I'm driving, 
                         get off the damn sidewalk.

               Meanwhile:

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He's got the other motorcycle on his tail, RELENTLESS GUNFIRE 
               dogging his every move.

               He shifts smooth as silk, squeezing between a car he's passing 
               and an oncoming car in the other lane. Half-Ear is trying 
               his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes 
               down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of 
               the:

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               His white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle 
               still right behind.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               Up ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention 
               Center. Stomps the gas.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What are you doing?

               The turbine howls.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What -- are -- you -- doing?

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               The Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the --

               INT. CONVENTION CENTER

               It's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing.

               Display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the 
               Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as --

               The motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really 
               on now.

               THUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps.

               Waves of people flee the path of the little car and --

               THUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind.

               The Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels 
               underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from 
               the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into 
               the carpeting.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Go that way!

               Handsome Rob turns, taking them down the --

               WEST HALL

               that stretches out toward the Staples Center.

               WHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by.

               Then --

               The Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and --

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER

               It bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside 
               entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement 
               pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out.

               INT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY

               The Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby.

               Down an aisle that leads right to --

               CENTER COURT

               where OUR L.A. LAKERS are in the midst of practice. The Minis 
               do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players.

               The car's tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor. 
               The team clears a path. The car is off the court before they 
               know it.

               But now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle.

               See the guns. See security guards running after it.

               KOBE BRYANT picks up a basketball.

               The motorcycle charges across center court.

               Kobe aims... hurls the ball. It RAMS into the motorcycle's 
               handlebars. The bike spins out of control and into a nasty 
               fall, spitting off the riders while --

               EXT. STAPLES CENTER

               The Mini crashes out the opposite side of the arena and glides 
               right through the L.A. Sports Arch of Fame before escaping 
               onto Figueroa. Meanwhile:

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA - DAY

               The Ferrari is eating up the pavement as it hounds after 
               Stella. Two police cars are roaring after them both.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She slaps the gears into action, maneuvers tight turns around 
               the cars in her path, just like she does at home with Jack 
               Daniels.

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               A cop car tries to pass the same car as the Ferrari but 
               smashes into an oncoming vehicle. As it spins like a corkscrew --

               EXT. FERRARI

               The rear tires spin smoke and it launches like a missile 
               after the Mini.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She keeps flooring it... the gauge rising... the customized 
               engine screaming...

               But the Ferrari, like an unstoppable force, hangs menacingly 
               in her rearview mirror.

               I/E FERRARI

               Steve RAMS into the rear bumper of the blue Mini. The bumper 
               tears off, rolls across the pavement. The Ferrari is about 
               to make another charge.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit. Suddenly finds 
               herself in the path of an ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK. She yanks 
               the wheel right to avoid a collision.

               INT. ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK

               The truck driver hits the brakes, over compensating as he 
               turns away from the Mini and --

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               The truck falls over onto its side, sending those big jugs 
               all over the road, water exploding into the air and --

               The Ferrari crashes through the jugs, one rolling up the 
               hood and over the windshield, dousing it like a car wash.

               The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.

               The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It 
               slams into the water truck.

               EXT. 5TH STREET

               Steve turned onto a one-way street and he's going the wrong 
               way. A Jeep Wrangler almost runs into him head-on but both 
               cars stop just in time.

               The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps 
               out, furious.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What's wrong with you, you stupid-
                         ass, son of a bitch, dickhead...

               As more invectives are hurled, Steve gets out of the Ferrari 
               and walks towards the furious driver.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What? You want a piece of me? C'mon, 
                         dumbshit. Bring it on. I'll be pulling 
                         peanuts out of your asshole --

               BANG. Steve shoots the guy's foot.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         Shit! Shit! You shot me in the foot!

               While the furious driver hops on one leg, Steve gets into 
               the Wrangler and takes off, abandoning the Ferrari. At the 
               same time --

               INT. BMW 750IL (MOVING) - SUNSET

               Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union 
               Station. Clear sailing for him.

               He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And 
               he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived 
               in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the 
               empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman.

                                     LYLE

                         Away.

                         The farther the better.

               EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY

               Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the 
               motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up 
               alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed 
               right at him.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, 
               driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel 
               Figueroa.

               With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the 
               building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with 
               a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers

               (it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)

               Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking 
               lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded 
               newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the 
               Mini.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He's got no place else to go...

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby 
               with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult 
               out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted 
               palm trees.

               The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the 
               elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The 
               elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Going up?

               INT. ELEVATOR

               The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches 
               out the window, presses the button for ROOF.

               He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber 
               across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.

               The door closes just in time.

               A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people 
               screaming at the sight of the guns.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.

               LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is 
               shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow 
               strip. Each tower has its own elevator.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big 
               problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red 
               and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even 
               the Mini couldn't squeeze through.

               In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and 
               out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not 
               about to abandon ship.

               EXT. ROOFTOP

               So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the 
               first tower and in --

               EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS

               His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground 
               deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a 
               football...

               NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP

               The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, 
               looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising 
               over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.

               And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of 
               the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it 
               forward --

               I/E CHARLIE'S MINI

               He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards 
               the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to 
               the last elevator, skids to a stop.

               He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his 
               shoulder to witness --

               THE MOTORCYCLE

               going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop 
               jump.

               But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...

               It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...

               Towards a large window on the top floor...

               Then lower...

               And the look on the driver's face says it all as...

               The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of 
               the building, just below the window.

               The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH 
               through the window as --

               A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the 
               LAPD chopper and --

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass 
               shards.

               I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER

               Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot 
               keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING 
               THROB, the injured chopper banks away.

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY

               PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out 
               then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY

               She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari.

               Just a Jeep Wrangler back there.

               Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET

               Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier 
               at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans.

               She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets 
               out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.

               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

               The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system.

               Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly 
               picking up speed.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT

               The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. 
               Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets 
               their attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I want to make a toast. Cause there's 
                         somebody missing here today, and we 
                         all know who it is.

               They all raise their glasses.

                                     CHARLIE
                         To John Bridger. The most brilliant 
                         master planner of them all. We wish 
                         he was with us.

               We PAN ACROSS their faces. It's been a three year odyssey 
               for them. They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved.

                                     ALL OF THEM
                         To John.

               Clink.

               INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...

               And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. 
               Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. 
               It's safe.

               He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING 
               a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.

               It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic 
               face of a Balinese girl on each one.

               Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.

               These bricks are real.

               But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks 
               of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

               Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.

               Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.

               Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.

               They cock their M-lls.

               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

               Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to 
               see the weapons pointed at him.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Take out your gun and drop it on the 
                         floor.

               Steve has no choice.

                                     STEVE
                         Who are you?

                                     MASHKOV
                         You knew my cousin. Yevhen.

                                     STEVE
                         I never knew anyone named Yevhen.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, 
                         this one. That gold is for us. A 
                         gift from some old friends of yours. 
                         They said to tell you that they didn't 
                         mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, 
                         as long as you didn't get any. Not 
                         even the toy surprise.

               The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.

               And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, 
               he begs.

                                     STEVE
                         Please. Don't shoot me. Please...

                                     MASHKOV
                         Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. 
                         I'm not going to shoot you.

                                     STEVE
                         Thank you. Thank God.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (to the others)
                         He really thought I was going to 
                         shoot him.

               The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.

                                     MASHKOV
                         No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. 
                         I'm going to hack off your limbs and 
                         bury you while you're still alive.

               And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a 
               coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME

               Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver 
               Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We 
               BOOM UP to our five thieves...

                         New IDs.

               Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when 
               they arrive in New Orleans.

                         once -- have a cool name?

               They're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He 
               answers.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you get what you wanted?

               INT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT

               Mashkov is on the other end of the line.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'm happy.

               During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is 
               connected to a phone jack in the car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It was good doing business with you.

               Lyle hits a final command and --

               signal box receives the command and --

               The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train 
               is electronically disengaged.

               This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The 
               train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.

               The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of 
               nowhere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Dining Car features crisp white linens and extended

               Karen is waiting for him. She looks resplendent.

                                     LYLE
                         Is this seat taken?

                         It is now.

               He sits. And as OUR CAMERA HOLDS ON Lyle, ready to embark on

                         to ask you, Stella. But I've just 
                         been so busy lately, what with the 
                         explosion, car chase, Ukrainians and

                         It's about that thing you said to me 
                         back in Philadelphia.

                                     STELLA

                         You said that you can't have a 
                         relationship with a pickpocket, gold 
                         robber, or any kind of thief.

                         Now that's an entirely different 
                         question.

   Play over this image.
   
   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (to camera)
             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
             its makers as being tough as the
             toughest customer.
   
   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
   VOICE begins talking over the video.
   
                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)
             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
             spray gun outta South Miami.
   
   After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.
   
                       BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
             for two hundred and sell 'em for
             eight.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
   ROBBIE.
   
   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
   
   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
   
   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
   body language and his thought process.
   
   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
   correction facility, in the real world his timing is
   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
   but attempt to sing anyway.
   
   The third person watching the video is the person who
   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
   from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
   and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
   
   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
   paying no attention to the video.
   
                       ORDELL
             This TEC-9? They advertise it as
             being the most popular gun in
             American crime. Can you believe that
             shit? It actually says that on the
             little booklet that comes with it.
             "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
             like they're proud of that shit.
   
   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
   
   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Check out this body-builder chick...
             Now see what she got. That's a Styer
             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
             Listen.
   
   Ordell punches up the volume.
   
   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
   
   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
             Austria. My customers don't know shit
             about it, so there ain't no demand.
                   (to Melanie)
             Baby, I could use some more ice.
   
   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
   from him and moves to the kitchen.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             But put that bad boy in a flick,
             every motherfucker out there want
             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
             they don't want one, they want two,
             cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
             What they don't know, and that movie
             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
             and steer a customer towards a 9-
             millimeter. Damn near the same
             weapon, don't have half the jammin'
             problems. But some niggas out there,
             you can't tell them anything. They
             want a .45. The killer had a .45,
             they want a .45.
   
   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
   sits where she was.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Thanks, Baby.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who's your partner?
   
   Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
   "Movieline Inside" magazine.
   
                       ORDELL
             Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in
             Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to
             him, gets it to my customers. On all
             my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't
             have a pot to piss in or a window to
             throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,
             motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He
             got himself a yacht, with all kinds
             of high tech navigational shit on it.
                   (back to video)
             AK-47, the very best there is.
   
   GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
   camera and describes the AK-47.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             When you absolutely, positively,
             gotta kill every motherfucker in the
             room, accept no substitute. That
             there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
             fifty and double my money.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       ORDELL(CONT'D)
             Get that for me, will ya baby?
   
                       MELANIE
             You know it's for you.
   
   Ordell just stares at her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Girl, you better not make me go over
             there and put my feet to ya.
   
   Louis keeps staring at he screen.
   
   Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
   the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
   says:
   
                       MELANIE
             Hello.
   
   Puts the phone down and says;
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             It's for you.
   
   Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
   chair, reclining back all the way.
   
   Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the
   phone.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (into phone)
             Yeah.
                   (pause)
             Hey, Junebug, what's up
   
   Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,
   watching the video.
   
   Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
   her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;
   
                       MELANIE
                   (referring to the tape)
             It's boring, isn't it?
   
                       LOUIS
             I can sit through it once.
   
                       MELANIE
             He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
   
                       MELANIE
             He's just repeating shit he
             overheard. He ain't any more a gun
             expert than I am.
   
   Holding up her pipe.
   
                       MELANIE
             Want a hit?
   
                       LOUIS
             Sure.
   
   Louis takes a hit off the pipe.
   
                       MELANIE
             When did you get out of jail?
   
                       LOUIS
             Four days ago.
   
                       MELANIE
             Where at?
   
                       LOUIS
             Susanville.
   
                       MELANIE
             How long?
   
                       LOUIS
             Two months shy of four years.
   
                       MELANIE
             Four years?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MELANIE
             What for?
   
                       LOUIS
             Bank robbery.
   
                       MELANIE
             Really, I'm impressed.
   
   Louis takes a drink of whiskey.
   
                       MELANIE
             Four years that's a long fuckin time.
   
   Louis nods his head in agreement.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
   Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of
   Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
             See, what did I tell you? Man in New
             York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and
             Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want
             it? It's the gun that nigga on "New
             York Undercover" uses. Because of
             that nigga, I can sell it to this
             nigga for twelve-fifty.
   
                       LOUIS
             What's your cost?
   
                       ORDELL
             As low as two.
   
                       LOUIS
             Are you serious?
   
                       ORDELL
             That's what I been tellin' you. Start
             adding these motherfuckin' figures
             up, and you tell me this ain't a
             business to be in.
   
   The phone rings again.
   
   Ordell looks at Melanie.
   
   Melanie looks at Ordell.
   
   They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up
   and gets the phone.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I got me five M-60 machine guns.
             These came straight from the Gulf
             War. I sold me three of them so far,
             twenty grand a piece.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's good money.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna
             make me a million dollars out of
             this. I already got me a half-a-
             million sittin' in Mexico. When I do
             this last delivery, I'm gonna make me
             another half-million.
   
                       LOUIS
             Then what?
   
                       ORDELL
             I get out. Spend the rest of my life
             spending.
   
   Melanie sits back down in he chair.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Who is it?
   
                       MELANIE
             It's Beaumont.
   
   
   KITCHEN
   
   Ordell, drink in hand, picks up the receiver.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (into phone)
             Beaumont¢Ordell. What's the problem?
                   (pause)
             What the fuck you doin' in jail?
                   (pause)
             What the fuck you doin' that for?
                   (pause)
             Ain't you got better sense than to be
             drivin' drunk carrying a goddam
             pistol?
   
   He listens to Beaumont on the other line - it's obvious
   Beaumont's starting to freak out. Ordell changes his
   tone.
   
                   ORDELL (CONT'D)
             - Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.
             Number one, you need to chill out,
             nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit
             ain't as bad as you think it is.
                   (pause)
             Course you're scared. That's what
             these motherfuckers get paid for
             scarin' the shit outta ya. That's
             their job. And my job is to get you
             the fuck home so let me tell you what
             is gonna happen... May I speak?...
             Thank you... You gonna spend the
             night in jail; it's too late to get
             you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna
             take you into court. I'm gonna be
             there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm
             gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut
             you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll
             be back home, I promise.
                   (pause)
             So just calm your ass down, and I'll
             see you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
             You owe me a helluva lot more than
             one, nigga.
                   (laughs)
             See you.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
   California. The name of the business is spelled out on
   the window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red
   cherry.
   
   Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.
   
   Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Inside Cherry Bail Bonds, looking out through the picture
   window. We can read the name on the glass backwards.
   Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
   building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.
   
   An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
   can be heard.
   
   Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang
   back."
   
                       MALE VOICE (O.S.)
             ... the judge doesn't give a fuck
             about that. He's ready to habitualize
             you. Is that what you want - you
             wanna look at ten years?
   
   The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a
   regular-Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind
   his desk talking on the phone. His eyes raise as he sees
   Ordell approach him.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll
             get you out, I promise. But it means
             I gotta pick you up tonight.
   
   Ordell motion to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
   motions for Ordell to take a seat.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Reggie, there ain't no two ways about
             it. You're spending the night in
             jail, but I already told you I'll get
             you out tomorrow. Now where are you?
                   (pause)
             You're at your mother's house, aren't
             you?
   
   Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).
   
   He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
   around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
   grinning.
   
   Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
   small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
   non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
   rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Okay. Just stay put till I come for
             you.
                   (pause)
             Reggie, do yourself a really big
             favor and be there when I get there.
   
   He hangs up the phone.
   
   Ordell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and
   smoking.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             How can I help you?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (indicating the Viceroy)
             Where would you like me to put my
             ash?
   
   Max looks at him for a moment.
   
                       MAX
             Use that coffee cup on the desk.
   
   Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
   bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.
   
                       ORDELL
             And I need me a bond for ten
             thousand.
   
   Max throws a look past Ordell to Louis.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Oh, that's just my white friend,
             Louis. He's got nothing to do with my
             business. We just hangin together.
             We're on our way to a cocktail
             lounge.
   
   From across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's
   direction.
   
   Max looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (returning to the photo)
             Who's that big Mandingo nigga you
             gotcha arm around?
   
   Max looks at him a moment and says;
   
                       MAX
             That's Winston. He works here.
   
                       ORDELL
             He's a big one. You two tight?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             It was our idea to take the picture,
             wasn't it?
   
   Max looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says;
   
                       MAX
             So, you want a ten-thousand dollar
             bond. What've you got for collateral?
   
                       ORDELL
             Gonna have to put up cash.
   
                       MAX
             You have it with you?
   
   Ordell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty
   chair next to him.
   
                       ORDELL
             It's in my bag.
   
                       MAX
             You have cash. What do you need me
             for?
   
                       ORDELL
             C'mon, you know how they do. Black
             man comes in with ten thousand, they
             wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they
             gonna wanna know where I got it.
             Second, they gonna keep a big chunk
             of it - start talkin' that court cost
             shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go
             through you.
   
                       MAX
             Cost you a thousand for the bond.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know that.
   
   Louis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other
   room drinking coffee.
   
                       MAX
             Who's it for? A relative?
   
                       ORDELL
             Fella named Beaumont. They have him
             up at county. It started out drunk
             driving, but they wrote it up
             "possession of a concealed weapon."
             Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
   
                       MAX
             Ten thousand sounds high.
   
                       ORDELL
             They ran his name and got a hit. He's
             been in before. Besides, Beaumont's
             from Kentucky, and I think they're
             prejudiced against black men from the
             South out here.
   
                       MAX
             He takes off and I gotta go to
             Kentucky to bring him back, you pay
             the expenses.
   
                       ORDELL
             You think you could do that?
   
   Max taking papers out of the drawer...
   
                       MAX
             I've done it.
   
   ... picking up the pen...
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What's his full name?
   
                       ORDELL
             Beaumont. That's the only name I
             know.
   
   Max looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious
   question.
   
   Max picks up the phone.
   
                       MAX
                   (on phone)
             Records office.
   
   Max on hold, looks at Ordell.
   
   Ordell smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (back on the line)
             Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry
             Bail Bonds. Who's this?
                   (pause)
             Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to
             look up the booking card and rough
             arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
                   (pause)
             That's all I have. I believe it's a
             surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.
   
   Louis enters the area, standing over Ordell.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm going to wait in the car.
   
                       ORDELL
             Sure.
                   (to Max)
             We almost done, ain't we?
   
                       MAX
             Getting there.
   
                       ORDELL
             You go wait in the car. Wait a
             minute.
   
   Ordell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of
   keys on it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
   
                       LOUIS
             Which one is for the car?
   
   Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki
   comes back on the line.
   
   Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (holding a key)
             This one's for the ignition...
                   (holding a little black
                   box)
             ... but you gotta hit this thing to
             shut the alarm off and unlock the
             door.
   
                       LOUIS
             What do I do?
   
                       ORDELL
             You ain't got to do nothing. Just
             point at it and push the button.
             You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
             means the alarm's off and the doors
             are open.
   
                       LOUIS
             Okay.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now play the volume as loud as you
             want but don't touch my levels. I got
             them set just the way I want 'em.
   
   Louis nods and goes out.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's
   black Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The
   car goes BLEEP.
   
   He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs
   inside.
   
   
   INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
   
   Max hangs up the phone.
   
                       MAX
                   (to Ordell)
             Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       ORDELL
             Livingston, huh?
   
                       MAX
             On his prior, he served nine months,
             and he's working on four years'
             probation.
   
                       ORDELL
             You don't say.
   
                       MAX
             Do you know what he's on probation
             for?
   
                       ORDELL
             Haven't a clue.
   
                       MAX
             Possession of unregistered machine
             guns.
   
                       ORDELL
             Will they consider this a violation
             of his probation?
   
                       MAX
             They do consider this a violation of
             his probation. Your boy's looking at
             ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, he won't like that. Beaumont
             don't got a doin' time disposition.
   
                       MAX
             I need your name and address.
   
                       ORDELL

                       MAX
             House or apartment?
   
                       ORDELL
             House.
   
                       MAX
             Now I need you to count your money.
   
   Ordell hands him the Lakers bag. Max takes the money out
   putting it on the desk.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hope you don't mind me askin' where
             you keepin' my money till I get it
             back. In your drawer?
   
   Max begins counting it.
   
                       MAX
             Across the street a Great Western. It
             goes in a trust account. You'll need
             to fill out an Application for
             Appearance Bond, an Indemnity
             Agreement, a Contingent Promissory
             Note. That's the one, if Beaumont
             skips and I go after him, you pay the
             expenses.
   
                       ORDELL
             Beaumont ain't going nowhere.
                   (he takes a pen out of
                   his pocket)
             Where do I sign?
   
   Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front
   of Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell
   reads the first agreement then says;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (reading the form)
             Hey, Max.
   
                       MAX
                   (still counting money)
             Yes.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (still reading form)
             I was wondering. What if before the
             court date gets here, Beaumont gets
             hit by a bus or something and dies.
                   (he puts the form down
                   and looks at Max)
             I get my money back, don't I?
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A BLACK FINGER
   
   Pressing a BLACK BUTTON next to the name, "BEAUMONT
   LIVINGSTON".
   
   
   INT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   BEAUMONT LIVINGSTON, wearing no shirt, sweatpants, and
   smoking a fatty answers the intercom, which buzzes
   loudly. We can hear JAY LENO interviewing a CELEBRITY on
   TV OFFSCREEN.
   
                       BEAUMONT
                   (into the speaker)
             Who is it?
   
   
   EXT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
   Hollywood apartment.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
   speaker.
   
                       ORDELL
             It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
             up.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Beaumont's finger pressing the entry
   button.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - The doorknob on the security gate,
   BUZZING. Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.
   
   Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his
   fingers. He sees Ordell approach.
   
   Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a
   big smile across his face.
   
                       ORDELL
             Look at you and your free ass. Come
             over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.
   
   Ordell and Beaumont embrace.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
             man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
             you... thank you... thank you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who was there for your ass?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             You were there for me.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             You.

   Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
   hard.
   
                       ORDELL
             You goddam right!
   
   Beaumont laughs.
   
                       ORDELL
             You see,ïit works like this. You get
             your ass in trouble, I get your ass
             out. That's my job. And I don't mind
             tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
             Ordell. They talkin' like they
             serious 'bout me doin' that machine
             gun time.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
             fright in your ass.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             If that's what they want to do,
             they're doin' it.
   
                       ORDELL
             How old is that machine gun shit?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Three years.
   
                       ORDELL
             Three years. That crime's old, man.
             They ain't got room in prison for all
             the motherfuckers out there killin'
             people. How they gonna find room for
             you?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             That's not what they're tellin' me.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's why they call it "fuckin' with
             ya." Now you wanna hear how we
             retaliate?
   
   Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
             Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let
             me tell you a little bit about my
             lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and
             this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my
             own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,
             he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And
             like Johnie Cochran, dude hates
             fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man
             lives to fuck with the police. So as
             a favor, I had him look at your case.
             Stacin told me you aint got shit to
             worry about. They just fuckin' wit
             ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on
             their ass, make 'em -
             (he bumps fist with Beaumont)
             ... Stop fuckin' wit ya!
   
   Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you
             know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was
             kinda hopin you could come with me.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What'd ya mean?
   
                       ORDELL
             Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
             does a nigga a favor - then BAM -
             hits a nigga up for a favor in
             return. But I'm afraid I gotta be
             that kinda nigga.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             I need a favor.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             That requires me goin out tonight?
   
                       ORDELL
             A bit.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
             goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,
             man. I'm home, I'm high -
   

                       ORDELL
             Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
             spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
             your ass home.
                   (changes tone)
             Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
             and you can help me.
   
   This has the desired effect.
   
                                               TIME CUT:
   
   
   WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
   
   Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
   Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
   with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
   STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What's the problem?
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
             situation. Remember I sold those
             three M-60 machine guns outta the
             five I got?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
             This group of Koreans in Koreatown
             have started a Neighborhood Watch
             kinda thing. And they want a few
             weapons so the neighborhood niggas
             know they mean business. So I'm gonna
             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
             Only problem, I aint never dealt with
             these Koreans before. Now I aint
             worried. Asians are by and large real
             dependable. They don't want no
             trouble. You might argue about price,
             but you aint gotta worry about them
             shootin' you in the back. But I got
             me kind of a rule. Never do business
             with nobody you ain't never done
             business with before without backup.
             That's why I need you, backup.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
             nowhere -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Let me finish. Can I finish?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Go ahead.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   TRUNK
   
   The trunk of a car is opened.
   
   Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
   action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
   of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
   a playing piece.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now you're gonn be in the trunk
             holding onto the shotgun. And I'm
             going to tell them I'm opening up my
             trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up
             the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
             boy.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
             anybody.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck I tell you. You don't
             hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
             gun. They'll get the idea.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
             be in there - ten minutes.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
             no minutes. Why don't I just ride
             with you?
   
                       ORDELL
             You can't ride with me. The surprise
             effect is ninety percent of it.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
             gittin' in that trunk.
   
                       ORDELL
             I can't believe you do me this way.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I ain't doin' you no way. I just
             ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
             problem with small places.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, my ass has got a problem
             spending ten thousand dollars of my
             own goddam money to get ungrateful,
             peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
             do it -
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Look, man, I know I owe you -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Well, if you owe me, git your ass
             in the trunk.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
             be locked in the trunk of no car.
   
                       ORDELL
             You think I wanted to spend ten
             thousand dollars on your ass?
   
   Beaumont starts to speak -
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Answer the question, nigga. Do you
             think I wanted to spend the thousand
             dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Course you didn't.
   
                       ORDELL
             But the only way to help you was to
             do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
             how 'bout this? After we're through
             fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
             you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
             My treat.
   
   Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
             smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
             side of red beans and rice.
             Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
   
   Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Now exactly how long I gotta be in
             this motherfucker.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   TRUNK
   
   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
   is SLAMMED closed.
   
   
   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
   
   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
   inside the dash.
   
   The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
   
   Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.
   
   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
   mouthing the words.
   
   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
   
   ... then stops.
   
   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
   goes black.
   
   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
   
   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
   the glovebox.
   
   The cab goes black.
   
   
   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
   
   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
   nowhere.
   
   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
   trunk and says;
   
                       ORDELL
             Don't worry. It's just me.
   
   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
   shotgun.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I was wondering. Did any federal
             people come visit you in jail and I
             should be watching my ass?
   
   Beaumont doesn't say anything.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You wouldn't tell me if they did and
             I wouldn't blame you.
   
   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
   
   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
   
   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
   
   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B
   song come back on, but VERY LOW.
   
   Ordell drives the Olds away.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping
   from one channel to another with a remote control,
   drinking cocktails from a can.
   
   The phone rings. He answers it.
   
                       LOUIS
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) - NIGHT
   
   Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the
   Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular
   phone next to his ear.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
   
                       ORDELL
             Whatcha watchin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back
             and forth. They had some black girl
             from some black show on Jay Leno. I
             watched that for a bit, but I kept
             flippin channels cause I didn't know
             who she was.
   
                       ORDELL
             Guess where I am?
   
                       LOUIS
             I dunno.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know you don't know. I said guess.
   
                       LOUIS
             The moon - I dunno
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
             cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
             outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
   
                       LOUIS
             You're outside?
   
                       ORDELL
             Uh-huh.
   
                       LOUIS
             C'mon in.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
             comfortable. I ain't about to walk
             into that roach motel and get
             uncomfortable. You bring your ass out
             here.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm in my underwear.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then put your goddam drawers on, and
             get your ass out here. I got
             somethin' to show you.
   
   
   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
   his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
   in front of the motel.
   
   As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
   comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
   in his seat looking up at Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know what your problem is, Louis?
   
   Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
   pockets.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You think you're a good guy. When you
             go into a deal you don't go in
             prepared to take that motherfucker
             all the way. You go in looking for a
             way out. And it ain't cause you're
             scared neither. It's cause you think
             you're a good guy, and you think
             there's certain things a good guy
             won't do. That's where we're
             different, me and you. Cause me, once
             I decide I want something, aint a
             goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
             me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
             get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
             Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
             removed. Understand what I'm saying?
   
   
   CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK
   
   Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
   his head blown off.
   
   Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
   back to Beaumont.
   
   Ordell closes the trunk.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who was that?
   
                       ORDELL
             That was Beaumont.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who was Beaumont?
   
                       ORDELL
             An employee I had to let go.
   
                       LOUIS
             What did he do?
   
                       ORDELL
             He put himself in a situation where
             he was gonna have to do ten years in
             the penetentiary, that's what he did.
                   (taking out a Viceroy and
                   lighting it up)
             And if you know Beaumont, you know
             there aint no way in hell he can do
             no ten years. And if you know that,
             you know Beaumont's gonna go any
             goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
             from doin' those ten years including
             telling the Federal government
             everything they want to know about my
             ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear
             case of him or me. And you best
             believe it aint gonna be me. You know
             what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
             this with me, you gotta be prepared
             to go all the way. I got me so far
             over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
             in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
             Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one
             more delivery, I'm gonna have me over
             a million. You think I'm gonna let
             this little cheese eatin' nigga here
             fuck that up? Shit, you better think
             again. 'Fore I let this deal get
             fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in
             the head, and ten niggas look just
             like em.
                   (pause)
             Understand what I'm sayin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             So we on the same page then?
   
                       LOUIS
             I follow.
   
   Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine
   smile).
   
   Louis grins.
   
   They both bump fists.

   INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
   
   A SUBTITLE reads:
   
   "LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"
   
   We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage
   at LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the
   opening credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as
   she walks down the row of cars.
   
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             Miss Brown.
   
   She turns towards the voice/camera.
   
   Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her,
   holding open his I.D. case.
   
                       DARGUS
             Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
             L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
             that bag?
   
                       JACKIE
             The usual things. I'm a flight
             attendant with Cabo Air.
   
   Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene.
   
                       NICOLET
             Can I be of some assistance?
   
   As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her
   purse, she says to Ray;
   
                       JACKIE
             I doubt it.
                   (to Dargus)
             Who's your friend?
   
                       DARGUS
             This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
             with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
             Would you mind if we looked in that
             bag?
   
   Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.
   
                       JACKIE
             Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
   
                       DARGUS
             You have the right to say "no." And I
             have the right to make you wait here
             with Ray while I go get a warrant.
             And if I don't want to go through all
             that trouble, I could just take you
             in on suspicion.
   
                       JACKIE
             Suspicion of what?
   
                       NICOLET
             All he wants to do is peek in your
             bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
             anything.
   
   Jackie shrugs and says;
   
                       JACKIE
             Go ahead.
   
   Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on
   his haunches, and starts feeling through her things.
   
   
   CLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG
   
   A soiled blouse, uniform skirt, - then a manila envelope,
   a fat one, nine-by-twelve.
   
   Jackie watches him straighten the clasp...
   
   
   ENVELOPE
   
   Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar
   bills secured with rubberbands.
   
   Nicolet whistles.
   
   Dargus looks up at her.
   
                       DARGUS
             I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
             thousand dollars here. What would you
             say Ray?
   
                       NICOLET
             That looks like fifty thousand
             dollars from here.
   
   
   JACKIE
   
   Not saying anything at the moment.
   
                       DARGUS
             This is your money?
   
                       JACKIE
             If I were to tell you "no it
             isn't..."
   
   Dargus smiles.
   
                       DARGUS
             You should know if you bring in
             anything over ten thousand you have
             to declare it. You forgot or what?
             You could get a two hundred and fifty
             thousand dollar fine, plus two years
             in prison. Now you want to talk to us
             about it, or you want to talk to
             Customs?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not saying another word.
   
                       NICOLET
             Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
             if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
             of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
             Something about that job makes them
             kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
             you want to talk with a bunch of
             suspicious, disagreeable people like
             them, or a couple good-hearted guys
             like Mark and myself.
   
   Nicolet smiles.
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Doesn't smile back.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives.
   Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP
   until noted.
   
   
   INT. DARGUS OFFICE - DAY
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Hey, this is my office. There's no
             smoking.
   
                       JACKIE
             Arrest me.
   
   Nicolet laughs O.S.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             We could, smart ass... or we could
             work out what's known as a
             Substantial Assistance Agreement.
             That is if you're willing to
             cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
             money and who you're giving it to.
   
   Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.)
             You got a good lawyer?
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Can she afford a good one is the
             question. Otherwise she'll be in
             Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
             the Public Defender gets around to
             her.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.)
             Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
             Livingston?
   
   Not a word.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
             'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
             did know you, Beaumont was found in
             the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
             twice. Once in the head and once in
             the chest.
   
   Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
             yesterday. You see, like you,
             Beaumont found himself in some hot
             water. He was looking at ten years he
             was pretty sure he didn't want to do
             and was understandably concerned. Now
             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
   
   Not a word.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             If you don't want to talk to us, I
             guess we'll just have to hand you
             over to Customs.
   
   Jackie puts out her cigarette.
   
                       JACKIE
             Okay, let's go.
   
   She stares down the cops.
   
   
   DARGUS AND NICOLET
   
   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
   first time in the scene.
   
                       DARGUS
             You know, Miss Brown, there's
             basically three types of people that
             we come along in the performance of
             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
             Victims, witnesses, innocent
             bystanders... You ain't any of these.
             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
             sonabitches have dedicated their
             lives to a life outside the law. That
             ain't you either. Where you belong is
             the third category. The category we
             refer to as LOSERS.
   
   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
   says without expression;
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not a loser.
   
                       DARGUS
             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
             flying for TWA and got busted for
             carrying drugs. You were carrying
             them for a pilot husband of yours. He
             did time and you got off. But that
             ended your career with the big
             airlines. Cut to thirteen years
             later. You're forty-four years of
             age. You're flying for the shittiest
             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
             Mexican airline that there is. Where
             you make a whopping twelve-thousand
             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
             lot to show for a twenty year career.
             And to top it off, you're going to
             jail. Now true, the judge, even with
             your prior, will probably only give
             you a year or two. But this doesn't
             seem like the time of life you got
             years to throw away.
                   (pause)
             Now, we don't like trying losers like
             they're criminals. But in the absence
             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
             wasn't this money given to you by an
             American living in Mexico by the name
             of Cedric Walker?
   
   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
   
   Nicolet joins back in.
   
                       NICOLET
             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
             the hell it was he worked for out
             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
             the same person you were supposed to
             deliver this money to?
   
   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
   
   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
   it.
   
                       DARGUS
             I'd like your permission to open this
             again. So we'll know exactly how much
             money we're talkin' about here.
   
   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
   it on the desk.
   
                       JACKIE
             Help yourself.
   
                       DARGUS
             While you're at it, let me see what
             else is in there. You mind?
   
   She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.
   
                       JACKIE
             My pocketbook.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's in it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Beauty products.
   
   Nicolet takes the manila envelope.
   
                       NICOLET
             I'll count the money.
   
   Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
   packets in it.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's this?
   
                       JACKIE
             That's my diet shit.
   
   Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.
   
                       DARGUS
             Let's see what else is in there.
   
   Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
   His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, Miss Brown?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah?
   
   Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
   half-inch or so of white powder inside.
   
                       NICOLET
             And what would this be, Sweet and
             Low?
   
                       JACKIE
             What the fuck is that shit?
   
                       NICOLET
             I know what it looks like.
   
                       JACKIE
             You planted that shit on me.
   
   Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, that shit ain't mine.
   
                       NICOLET
                   (to Dargus)
             It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
             how 'bout Posession with the Intent
             to Distribute?
   
                       DARGUS
             Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
             all the cash, I think I could go with
             Conspiracy to Traffic.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
             about that fuckin' shit.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
             have a seat and tell us who might
             know something about this fuckin'
             shit.
   
   Jackie just looks at the two grinning Cheshire cats as
   the balance of power rolls over on her.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. TORRANCE MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
   
   A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the
   Torrance Court House.
   
   
   INT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
   
   Jackie, now wearing County Jail blues, sits next to
   another BLACK WOMAN. Their hands cuffed together.
   
   The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF
   unlocks the gate that encloses the prisoners. Then
   explains in a you-better-do-exactly-what-I-say manner,
   how they're going to leave the bus.
   
   
   EXT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
   
   MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues
   and handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.
   
   The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the
   court house.
   
   
   INT. HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - DAY
   
   Dargus and Nicolet confer with the PUBLIC DEFENDER, an
   attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit.
   
                       DARGUS
             If she'll cooperate with us, we'll
             turn possession with intent into
             plain ol' Possession, and she can
             bond outta here for one thousand
             bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll
             go for the Intent and request a
             twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.
   
   
   INT. COURTROOM - DAY
   
   Jackie and the Public Defender. Jackie, in her county
   blues; Public Defender in her nice suit.
   
                       JACKIE
             You tell those guys they'll have to
             do one helluva lot better than that
             before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             Well, that's the State's offer. If
             you plead to possession and tell
             L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your
             bond will be set at one-thousand
             dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will
             request one at twenty- five thousand
             based on your prior record and risk
             of flight. If you don't post it or
             don't know anyone who can, you'll
             spend six to eight weeks in County
             before your arraignment comes up.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who's side are you on?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             I beg your pardon?
   
                       JACKIE
             What if I plead guilty?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             And cooperate? You might get
             probation.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I don't cooperate?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             With the prior? You could get
             anywhere from a year to five
             depending on the judge. You want to
             think about it? You got two minutes
             before we're up.
   
   
   COURT IN SESSION
   
   It's a full schedule in court today. Jackie sits with a
   bunch of other females wearing county blues in the
   defendant's area (where the jury sits during a jury
   trial)
   
   Dargus and Nicolet sit in the courtroom.
   
   The JUDGE reads the next case.
   
                       JUDGE
             Brown. Case number 700324.
   
   Jackie rises amongst the other defendants.
   
   The P.D. rises.
   
   Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.
   
                       JUDGE
             The charge is possession of Narcotics
             with the Intent to Distribute. How
             does your client plead?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             She wishes to stand mute, your honor.
   
                       JUDGE
             Very well...
                   (to Dargus)
             ... Detective Dargus - You're the
             arresting officer in his case,
             correct?
   
                       DARGUS
             That's correct, your honor.
   
                       JUDGE
             You have a recommendation for bail?
   
                       DARGUS
             Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
             defendant's prior conviction and the
             extreme possibility of flight due to
             her occupation, the State requests a
             bond of no less than twenty-five
             thousand.
   
   The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...
   
                       JUDGE
             I'll set bond at ten thousand and set
             the date of August 14th for the
             arraignment.
   
                       JACKIE
             When is that, your honor?
   
                       JUDGE
             That's six weeks from now, Miss
             Brown. We'll continue this matter
             then. Owens, case 72242.
   
   Jackie sits down.
   
   Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle
   together.
   
   Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking
   pisses her off.
   
   
   DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
   
   We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a
   perspective from the back of the courtroom.
   
   We see Jackie in the defendant's area.
   
   We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way
   out of the courtroom.
   
   
   ORDELL
   
   Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any
   expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out
   of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.

   "MAX CHERRY"
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
   
   The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush
   behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges,
   zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.
   
   He looks up and stops dead.
   
   Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of
   Max's desk.
   
                       ORDELL
             Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you
             wash your hands.
   
   Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his
   desk.
   
                       MAX
             Comfortable?
   
                       ORDELL
             The door was opened, so I just came
             right in.
   
                       MAX
             I can see that. Why?
   
                       ORDELL
             I got some more business for ya.
   
                       MAX
             Oh, yeah? What did he do?
   
                       ORDELL (O.S.)
             She is an airline stewardess. Got
             caught coming back from Mexico with
             some blow. They set her bond this
             afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
             I was thinkin', you could use the ten
             thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
             move it over on to the stewardess.
   
                       MAX
             The bond for possession is only a
             thousand.
   
                       ORDELL
             They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
             it Possession with Intent. A black
             woman in her forties gets busted with
             less than two ounces on her, they
             call that shit Intent. Same shit
             happened to a movie star. It's
             Possession.
   
                       MAX
             It still sounds high.
   
                       ORDELL
             She had, I believe it was... fifty
             grand on her, too. There was a cop at
             the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
             wanted her bond set at twenty-five
             thousand, saying there was a risk of
             flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
             all.
   
                       MAX
             Before we start talking about
             stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of
             the way first.
   
   Sitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not
   quite.
   
                       ORDELL
             Somebody already did.
   
                       MAX
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             You didn't hear?
   
                       MAX
             Hear what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Somebody with a grudge blew
             Beaumont's brains out - hey, that
             rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.
   
                       MAX
             Did the police contact you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Very first motherfuckin' thing they
             did. They see I put up a big money
             bond on my boy, they start thinking
             with that where-there's-smoke-there's
             fire logic. They roust my ass outta
             bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
             Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
             to death. She thought they were gonna
             take my ass away for sure.
   
                       MAX
             The stewardess. Do you know her last
             name?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (smiles)
             Brown, Jackie Brown.
   
                       MAX
             What does she do for you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Who says she does anything for me?
             She's my friend. When my friends get
             into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
   
                       MAX
             Beaumont worked for you.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's what the police thought. I
             told them I'm unemployed, how could I
             have anybody work for me? Now I bail
             out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
             police on me again, huh? Wanting to
             know was she doing things for me, was
             she bringing me that money!
   
                       MAX
             Was she?
   
                       ORDELL
             Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
             client relationship? The lawyer can't
             tell nothing he hears?
   
                       MAX
             You're not my client until you get
             busted and I bond you out.
   
                       ORDELL
             If there's no - what do you call it -
             confidentiality between us? Why would
             I tell you anything?
   
                       MAX
             Cause you want me to know what a
             slick guy you are. You got
             stewardesses bringing you fifty
             grand.
   
                       ORDELL
             Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
             grand?
   
                       MAX
             You want me to speculate on what you
             do. I'd say you're in the drug
             business, except the money's moving
             in the wrong direction. Whatever
             you're into, you seem to be getting
             away with it, so more power to you.
             Okay you want another bond, and you
             want to move over the ten thousand
             you put down on Beaumont to the
             stewardess. That means paperwork. I
             have to get a death certificate,
             present it to the court, fill out a
             receipt for return of bond
             collateral, then type up another
             application. An indemnity agreement -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Jackie aint got time for all that
             shit -
   
                       MAX
             - I'm telling you what I have to do.
             What you have to do, in case you
             forgot, is come up with premium of a
             thousand bucks.
   
                       ORDELL
             I got it. I just don't got it on me.
   
                       MAX
             Well, come back when you do, and I'll
             bond out the stewardess.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, you know I'm good for it.
             Thousand bucks ain't shit.
   
                       MAX
             If I don't see it in front of me,
             you're right. It ain't shit.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, you need to look at this with a
             little compassion. Jackie ain't no
             criminal. She ain't used to this
             kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
             don't give a fuck - but for the
             average citizen, coupla nights in
             County fuck with your mind.
   
                       MAX
             Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
             don't have a tab.
   
                       ORDELL
             Just listen for a second. We got a
             forty-year-old, gainfully employed
             black woman, falsely accused -
   
                       MAX
             Falsely accused? She didn't come back
             from Mexico with cocaine on her?
   
                       ORDELL
             Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
             that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
             - it was just her shit to get high
             with.
   
                       MAX
             Is white guilt supposed to make me
             forget I'm running a business?
   
   Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.
   
                       ORDELL
             Okay, man. I got your money. But
             don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
             favor.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
   
   It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is
   driving to the County Jail with a client, a young
   Hispanic woman of twenty named ANITA.
   
                       MAX
             Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation
             officer. Karen's a good kid, but
             she's mad at you, because you lied to
             her. This business about your
             grandmother's funeral
   
                       ANITA
             I went. I did. I took my mother and
             little brother.
   
                       MAX
             But you didn't ask permission. You
             broke a trust. If you had asked,
             Karen probably would have let you.
             I'm sure she would.
   
                       ANITA
             I know. That's why I went.
   
                       MAX
             But then you told her you were home.
   
                       ANITA
             Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I
             could go.
   
   Max gives up.
   
                       MAX
             I don't know. Maybe it's a language
             problem.
                   (getting stern)
             Anita, you ever cause this much
             heartache over something that could
             easily be avoided, I'll never write
             you again. You understand?
   
                       ANITA
             I understand.
   
                       MAX
             I mean it. I don't care how many
             times your mother calls or how much
             she cries.
   
   Like an exasperated teenager.
   
                       ANITA
             I understand.
   
                       MAX
             Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
   
                       ANITA
             Yes, Max, I understand.
   
   
   INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT
   
   POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE
   
   Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed
   behind her back.
   
                       MAX
             Dropping off and picking up. Dropping
             of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
             Jackie.
   
   We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max
   undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take
   her away.
   
                       ANITA
             So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
   
                       MAX
             I'll call her.
   
                       ANITA
             Won't forget?
   
                       MAX
             I won't forget.
   
   She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her
   away.
   
                       ANITA
             Thanks, Max. See you later.
   
   Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len
   Deighton paperback and begins to read.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   MAX
   
   Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S
   voice.
   
                       SHERIFF (O.S.)
             Max! Here she comes.
   
   Max puts his book down and see -
   
   Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS.
   She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small
   envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When
   Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone
   with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this
   Jackie Brown's a knockout.
   
   As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail
   slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes.
   
   He approaches, handing her his card.
   
                       MAX
             Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm
             your bail bondsman.
   
   She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             I can give you a lift home if you'd
             like?
   
                       JACKIE
             Okay.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT
   
   Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you really a bail bondsman?
   
                       MAX
             Who do you think I am?
   
   She doesn't answer.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             I gave you my card there.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can I see your I.D.?
   
                       MAX
             You're serious?
   
   She waits.
   
   Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her,
   then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her
   to see.
   
   
   MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF
   CALIFORNIA
   
                       JACKIE
             Who put up my bond? Ordell?
   
                       MAX
             In cash.
   
   She looks straight ahead.
   
   Max shifts into drive.
   
   Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY
   comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window
   Max's .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy
   his pass in exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then
   puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He
   drives on.
   
   
   MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)
   
                       JACKIE
             Can we stop for cigarettes?
   
                       MAX
             Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't think so.
   
                       MAX
             It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
   
                       JACKIE
             Couldn't we just stop at a seven-
             eleven?
   
                       MAX
             I thought you might want a drink?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'd love one, but not there.
   
                       MAX
             We could stop at the Hilton by the
             airport.
   
                       JACKIE
             Is it dark?
   
                       MAX
             It's kind of a sports bar
   
                       JACKIE
             That doesn't sound dark.
   
                       MAX
             Why does it need to be dark?
   
                       JACKIE
             'Cause I look like I just got outta
             jail, that's why. You droppin' me off
             at home, right? There's a place by
             me.
   
                       MAX
             Great.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
   
   A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick
   inn.
   
   
   INT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
   
   CLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out.
   
   Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
   the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
   join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
   return.
   
   The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
   dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
   Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
   lives (about ten minutes from LAX)
   
   The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
   and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
   years before it became a black bar.
   
   A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B.
   
   Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
   a bar candle in a red glass thing.
   
   Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
   white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
   Max.
   
                       MAX
             No thanks, I quit three years ago.
   
   As she lights her cigarette.
   
                       JACKIE
             You gain weight?
   
                       MAX
             Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back
             on.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why I don't quit. If I can't
             fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch
             of a time gettin' my brand.
   
                       MAX
             What's your brand?
   
                       JACKIE
             Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
             They're hard to find here. I was
             locked up with the last two getting
             legal advice from a woman who was in
             for bustin' her boyfriend's head open
             with a baseball bat.
   
                       MAX
             Was she helpful?
   
                       JACKIE
             She was more helpful than the fuckin'
             Public Defender.
                   (she takes a sip of wine)
             I don't know - I guess what I need is
             a lawyer, find out what my options
             are.
   
                       MAX
             You know, I figured out the other day
             I've written something like' fifteen
             thousand bonds since I've been in the
             business. I'd say about eighty
             percent of them were at least drug
             related. If you want, I can help you
             look at your options.
   
   Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.
   
                       JACKIE
             You're not tired of it?
   
                       MAX
                   (smiles)
             I am, as a matter of fact.
   
   A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What have they told you?
   
                       JACKIE
             So far I've been told I can cooperate
             and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
             stand mute and get as much as five
             years. Does that sound right?
   
                       MAX
             I'd say if you're tried and found
             guilty you won't get more than a year
             and a day. That's State time. Prison.
   
                       JACKIE
                   (under her breath)
             Shit.
   
                       MAX
             But they won't want to take you to
             trial. They'll offer you simple
             Possession, a few months of County
             time, and a year or two probation.
                   (pointing to her drink)
             How 'bout another?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
   Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
   ROWEN for two more.
   
                       MAX
             You know who put the dope in your
             bag?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, but that's not what this was
             about. They were fuckin waitin' for
             my ass. They knew I had that money,
             they even knew the amount. The one
             who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
             Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
             "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
             here. What would you say?" But all
             they could do was threaten me and
             hand me over to Customs, and I could
             tell they didn't want to do that.
   
                       MAX
             They wanted you to tell them what you
             know.
   
                       JACKIE
             I had 'em too. I burnt those two
             Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
             Then their asses lucked out and found
             that coke.
   
                       MAX
             What did they want to know?
   
                       JACKIE
             Who gave me the money and who I was
             giving it to. And some guy they found
             in a trunk with his head blown off.
             Said it was him who told them 'bout
             me.
   
   The Waitress comes with the drinks.
   
                       ROWEN
             Can I get you two some popcorn?
   
                       MAX
             No, thanks.
   
   Rowen exits.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             That would be Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's him. How do you know 'em?
   
                       MAX
             I wrote him on Monday. They found him
             dead on Tuesday.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell pick up his bond?
   
                       MAX
             Same as you. Ten thousand.
   
                       JACKIE
             The federal agent kinda half hinted
             Ordell might of done Beaumont.
   
                       MAX
             You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
             but you didn't mention the Federal.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't?
   
                       MAX
             No, you didn't. What branch?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,
             and Firearms.
   
   Max puts it together.
   
                       MAX
             He's the one who wants you.
   
                       JACKIE
             It was the other guy who busted me.
   
                       MAX
             'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
             hell bonding out of federal court. He
             doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
             you to tell him what you know. He
             uses you to get a line on Ordell,
             make a case, then take him federal.
             You know what Ordell's into?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
             aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
             smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
             leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
             be interested in.
   
   Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
   her mind and makes a decision.
   
                       JACKIE
             I used to bring over ten thousand at
             a time. That's the legal limit, so I
             never brought more than that.
   
                       MAX
             How many trips did you make?
   
                       JACKIE
             With ten thousand? Nine.
   
                       MAX
             He's got that kinda money?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
             bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
             what do you call it when you got
             money, but don't have cash?
   
                       MAX
             Cash poor?
   
                       JACKIE
             That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
             me till I finally said okay. I'll
             bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
             twelve envelope. I got paid five
             hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
             Walker, in Mexico gave me the
             envelope.
   
                       MAX
             If you knew bringing anything over
             ten thousand was against the law, why
             not pack a hundred grand?
   
   Jackie gets exasperated.
   
                       JACKIE
             Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
             and not hit you in the face if the
             bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
             problem. I gotta figure out a way to
             either keep my job or get out of
             trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
             leave the country I'm out of a job.
             And if I don't got a job, I can't
             hire a lawyer.
   
                       MAX
             Ask A.T.F. They might give you
             permission.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, if I cooperate.
   
                       MAX
             Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
             gonna have to give 'em something.
   
                       JACKIE
             But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
             name - I don't really know shit about
             what he does or how he does it - That
             don't give me much to bargain with.
   
                       MAX
             Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
             Show a willingness to be helpful. You
             want to stay out of jail, don't you?
   
   Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What'dya think?
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             I think maybe I have more options
             than I thought.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP: ORDELL
   
   Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street
   from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny
   Cash is playing inside his car.
   
   
   EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT
   
   ORDELL'S POV
   
   Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
   and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
   off.
   
   
   ORDELL
   
   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
   
   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
   moment, then Jackie opens the door.
   
                       ORDELL
             How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was expecting you. Come in.
   
   Jackie holds the door open for him.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
   the living room.
   
                       ORDELL
             You got some booze?
   
   Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
   frightened.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got some vodka in the freezer.
   
                       ORDELL
             Got some o.j.?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, then, why don't you be a good
             hostess and make me a screwdriver?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
   Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
   hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
   doesn't turn on the light.
   
                       ORDELL
             You gonna thank me?
   
   Taking a glass from the cupboard.
   
                       JACKIE
             For what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Who you think got your ass outta
             jail?
   
   Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes
   and taking out vodka.
   
                       JACKIE
             The same guy who put me in, thanks a
             lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
             our business.
   
   Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
   takes out orange juice, then closes the door.
   
                       JACKIE
             It wasn't mine.
   
   Ordell has to stop and think.
   
   Jackie makes screwdriver.
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
             Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
             Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
             there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
             shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
             apologize. I 'magine they asked you a
             shitload of questions about it, huh?
             All that money, want to know where
             you got it?
   
   Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
   handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'magine they asked who you givin' it
             to, too.
   
                       JACKIE
             They asked.
   
                       ORDELL
             And what was your answer?
   
                       JACKIE
             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
   
                       ORDELL
             You positive about that? You weren't
             nervous and let something slip by
             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
             just gotta know.
   
   Jackie says to his face;
   
                       JACKIE
             You're not asking the right
             questions.
   
   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.
   
                       JACKIE
             Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       ORDELL
             I knew it.
   
                       JACKIE
             And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
   
   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah?
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't tell 'em anything.
   
   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL
             My name come up?
   
   Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
   
   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
   gloved hands on her shoulders.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You say anything about me?
   
   Jackie shakes her head "no."
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
   
   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
   his, but still shows no fear.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             This fella Beaumont, they say what
             happened to him?
   
                       JACKIE
             They told me.
   
   At this moment the film becomes a:
   
   
   SPLIT SCREEN
   
   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
   driving home in his Seville.
   
   
   MAX IN CAR
   
   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
   "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
   COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
   
   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
   Torrance.
   
   
   ORDELL AND JACKIE
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
             what he might say to keep from doin
             some time. I'magine from time-to-time
             they asked you a whole shitload of
             questions. And you didn't give 'em no
             answer?
   
   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
   
   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
   of her throat.
   
                       ORDELL
             You scared of me?
   
   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
   leaving his. Reaches over the seat
   
                       ORDELL
             You got a reason to be nervous with
             me?
   
   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
   
   Ordell hears a CLICK.
   
   Can't believe it.
   
   
   MAX IN CAR
   
   Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...
   
   
   THE GLOVE BOX
   
   The gun is gone.
   
                       MAX
             Where is it?
   
   
   A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH
   
                       ORDELL
             Is that what I think it is?
   
                       JACKIE
             What do you think it is?
   
   
   CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH
   
                       ORDELL
             I think it's a gun pressing against
             my dick.
   
                       JACKIE
             You thought right... Now take your
             hands from around my throat, nigga.
   
   Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.
   
   END OF SPLIT SCREEN
   
   Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
   pushes him against the wall.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the hell you doin'?
   
                       JACKIE
             Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
   
   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
   pocket
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
             with you. I just carry that. You been
             listenin' to them cops too much.
   
                       JACKIE
             The cops didn't try and strangle my
             ass.
   
                       ORDELL
             Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
             you.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
             gonna unload both these
             motherfuckers, you don't do what I
             tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
   
                       ORDELL
             Baby, I ain't come here -
   
   She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
   
                       JACKIE
             I said, you understand what I'm
             saying
   
                       ORDELL
             I understand woman, damn!
   
                       JACKIE
             Go sit over in that chair.
   
   Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
   Ordell still tries bullshit...
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm tellin' you, those cops been
             fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
             black against black, that's how they
             do.
   
                       JACKIE
             Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
             down.
   
   Ordell sits.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Put both hands behind our head.
   
   Ordell does...
   
                       ORDELL
             This shits gettin silly now...
   
   Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.
   
                       JACKIE
             I gotta tell you to shut up one more
             time, I'm gonna shut you up.
   
   Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
   hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
   
   A coffee table lays between them.
   
   Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
   
                       ORDELL
             I just came here to talk.
   
                       JACKIE
             Way I see it, me and you only got one
             thing to talk about. What you willing
             to do for me?
   
   Ordell looks at her a moment and says;
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
   
   Jackie shakes her head "no!"
   
                       JACKIE
             Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
             later they're gonna get around to
             offering me a plea deal, and you know
             that. That's why you came here to
             kill me.
   
                       ORDELL
             - Baby, I didn't -
   
                       JACKIE
             - It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
             let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
             And if I don't, I go to jail.
   
   Ordell, very interested.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah?
   
                       JACKIE
             One hundred thousand put in an escrow
             account in my name, if I'm convicted
             up to a year, or put on probation. If
             I have to do more than a year, you
             pay another hundred thousand.
   
   Ordell just takes in what the woman said.
   
                       ORDELL
             I got a problem...
   
                       JACKIE
             All your money's in Mexico.
   
   Ordell has to smile at the woman.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah.
   
                       JACKIE
             I been thinkin about that, too, and I
             got me a idea.
   
                                               TIME CUT:
   
   
   DOORWAY
   
   Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
   into FRAME, and talks with him.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
             tell you if it's on.
   
                       ORDELL (O.S.)
             Talk to you tomorrow.
   
   Ordell leaves.
   
   Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   OVER BLACK
   
   We hear a knock-knock on the door.
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   SAME SHOT DORWAY
   
   Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
   visitor;
   
                       JACKIE
             You want your gun, don't you? Come
             in. I'll go get it.
   
   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
   
   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
   
   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
   of sad smile.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
             asked to borrow it you'd say no.
             You'd have to. Would you like some
             coffee?
   
   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
   completely, leaving only curiosity.
   
                       MAX
             If you're having some.
   
                       JACKIE
             I am. Have a seat.
   
   Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
   at the dining table off of the kitchen.
   
                       MAX
             You get a chance to use it?
   
                       JACKIE
             I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
             went bad when I was in jail.
   
                       MAX
             Black's fine.
   
   She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
   coffee in it.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You want to hang on to it awhile? It
             wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
   
   Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks, but I have my own now.
   
                       MAX
             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun?
   
   She turns off the water.
   
                       JACKIE
             What, I couldn't hear you?
   
                       MAX
             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun.
   
   Pouring water into the coffee machine.
   
                       JACKIE
             Let's just say I got one, okay?
   
   She turns on the coffeemaker.
   
                       MAX
             Somebody loan it to you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Jackie leaves the kitchen.
   
   Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Want to hear some music?
   
                       MAX
             Sure.
   
   Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
   leaned up against the wall on the floor.
   
                       JACKIE
             I couldn't wait till I got home last
             night and wash my hair.
   
                       MAX
             It looks nice.
   
   She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
   album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
   turntable.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You never got into the whole CD
             revolution?
   
                       JACKIE
             I got a few. But I can't afford to
             start all over again. I got too much
             time and money invested in my
             records.
   
   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
   from the early seventies.
   
                       MAX
             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
             records.
   
   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't buy new stuff that often.
   
   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
   cigarette and stands.
   
   Max listens to the soul song.
   
                       MAX
             This is pretty.
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MAX
             Who is this?
   
                       JACKIE
             The Delfonics.
   
                       MAX
             '76?
   
                       JACKIE
             '74, I think.
   
                       MAX
             It's nice.
   
   They listen for a moment.
   
                       JACKIE
             I called in sick this morning. As far
             as the airline knows, I'm still
             available.
   
                       MAX
             Are you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
             with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
             what you suggested. Offer to help and
             see what happens.
   
                       MAX
             What I meant was have a lawyer do the
             negotiating for you.
   
                       JACKIE
             I want to talk to them first. I know
             more now about Ordell's money.
   
                       MAX
             Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
             who wants you, that'll only interest
             him up to a point.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
             million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
             safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
   
                       MAX
             How'd you find that out?
   
                       JACKIE
             He told me last night.
   
                       MAX
             He called you?
   
                       JACKIE
             He came by.
   
                       MAX
             What?... What'd you do?
   
                       JACKIE
             We talked.
   
   Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
   but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             He had his doubts at first. But he's
             always trusted me an wants more than
             anything to believe he still can.
   
                       MAX
             Why?
   
                       JACKIE
             He needs me. Without me all that
             money is just gonna sit over there in
             Cabo. Sugar?
   
                       MAX
             No thanks. There's gotta be other
             ways to get it out.
   
   She pours the coffee.
   
                       JACKIE
             Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
             used. He can't trust his other
             people. They're crooks. He can try
             bringing I in himself, but Ordell
             sure don't want to go through no
             Customs line. Either he recruits
             another Cabo stewardess, or he
             continues to trust me. I made him
             feel he still can.
   
   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
   sits down.
   
                       MAX
             How do you get it out?
   
                       JACKIE
             Same way I been don', but first they
             got to let me go back to work.
   
                       MAX
             You're gonna offer to set him up?
   
                       JACKIE
             If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
             'em.
   
                       MAX
             It's very possible Ordell's killed
             somebody.
   
                       JACKIE
             I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
             doin' that probation thing again.
   
   Max watches her a moment
   
   Jackie takes a drink of coffee.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             How do you feel about getting old?
   
                       MAX
             You're not old. You look great.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm asking how you feel. Does it
             bother you?
   
                       MAX
             It's not really something I think
             about.
   
                       JACKIE
             Really?
   
                       MAX
             Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
             hair. It started falling out ten
             years ago. So I did something about
             it.
   
                       JACKIE
             How'd you feel about it?
   
                       MAX
             I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
             done it, I did it to feel better
             about myself, and I do. When I look
             in the mirror it looks like me.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's different with men.
   
                       MAX
             You know, I can't really feel too
             sorry for you in that department.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             In fact, I'd make a bet that except
             possibly for an Afro - you look
             exactly the same as you did at twenty
             nine.
   
   Jackie smiles into her coffee.
   
                       JACKIE
             My ass ain't the same.
   
                       MAX
             Bigger?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Max smiles.
   
                       MAX
             Nothin wrong with that.
   
   Jackie's smile grows bigger.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Does something else worry you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I just feel like I'm always starting
             over. You said how many bonds you
             wrote?
   
                       MAX
             Fifteen thousand.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I've flown seven million miles.
             And I've been waitin' on people
             almost twenty years. The best job I
             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
             which is about the worst job you can
             get in this industry. I make about
             sixteen thousand, with retirement
             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
             now with this arrest hanging over my
             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
             gotta start all over again, but I got
             nothin to start over with. I'll be
             stuck with whatever I can get. And
             that scares me more than Ordell.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
   
   A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the
   big building... ten heads for the office of Mark Dargus.
   
   He reaches the closed door... raps on it.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Come in.
   
   Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown
   sitting in the office talking.
   
                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
             Great, you're here.
   
                       NICOLET
             Hey, Jackie.
   
   Jackie waves.
   
   Dargus stands up and says to Jackie;
   
                       DARGUS
             Let me have a word outside with Agent
             Nicolet for a moment?
   
                       JACKIE
             Take your time.
   
                       DARGUS
             Thanks.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well just be a minute.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can I smoke?
   
                       DARGUS
             Go ahead.
   
   The two detectives step outside and close the door on
   Jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's going on?
   
                       DARGUS
             She wants to make a deal.
   
                       NICOLET
             She sound scared?
   
                       DARGUS
             She almost sounds scared.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's she want?
   
                       DARGUS
             She wants to go back to work.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's she willing to give us?
   
                       DARGUS
             She hasn't one into specifics yet,
             she's been waiting for you.
   
                       NICOLET
             She knows it's my case?
   
                       DARGUS
             She ain't said it, but she's not
             stupid, she knows it's you who wants
             her.
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.
   
   Dargus and Nicolet come back inside.
   
                       NICOLET
             Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell
             me, what can we do for you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I need permission to leave the
             country so I keep my job.
   
                       NICOLET
             We can look into that.
   
                       JACKIE
             I need it tomorrow. If I don't show
             up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
   
                       NICOLET
             You know what we want.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I'm working, I can help you.
   
                       DARGUS
             Help us do what?
   
                       JACKIE
             Help you get Ordell Robbie.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, so now you know him?
   
                       JACKIE
             You never asked me if I did or not.
   
                       DARGUS
             But now you're telling us now you do.
   
                       JACKIE
             'Course I do - I deliver money for
             him.
   
                       NICOLET
             No shit. You know how he makes hi
             money?
   
                       JACKIE
             He sells guns.
   
                       NICOLET
             You ever see him sell guns?
   
                       JACKIE
             No.
   
                       NICOLET
             Then how do you know he sells guns?
   
                       JACKIE
             He told me. Besides, why else would
             an A.T.F. man be after him?
   
                       NICOLET
             How can you help us?
   
                       JACKIE
             Short of wearing a wire, I'll do
             everything I can to help you throw
             his ass in jail. And in exchange for
             my help, I need permission to leave
             the country and immunity.
   
                       DARGUS
             You don't want much, do you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Can you do it or not?
   
   The two cops look at each other.
   
                       DARGUS
                   (to Nicolet)
             It's your call.
   
   Nicolet looks at Jackie.
   
                       NICOLE
             It's possible.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   TITLE CARD:
   
   "LOUIS GARA & MELANIE"
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   FADE UP ON ON TV
   
   Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
   proclaiming he's the "mad dog." The film is an Italian
   Policier from the seventies.
   
   Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
   hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up
   a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit.
   Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts
   and a loose top.
   
   The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through
   it carrying shopping bags.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're back.
   
                       MELANIE
             'Ola!
   
   We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new
   "look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black
   jeans.
   
   Melanie notices the change.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got
             some new clothes.
   
                       ORDELL
             We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy
             running around lookin' like a bum on
             the street.
   
                       LOUIS
             I didn't look like a bum.
   
                       ORDELL
             But you did have a Salvation Army-
             thing going.
   
   Ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the
   air.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Goddam, girl. You gettin' high
             already. It's only two o'clock.
   
   Melanie smiles.
   
                       MELANIE
             It's that late?
   
   Louis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback.
   
                       ORDELL
             Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too
             much of that shit. That shit robs you
             of your ambition.
   
                       MELANIE
             Not if your ambition is to get high
             and watch TV.
   
   Melanie and Louis laugh.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       ORDELL
             You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,
             ain't ya.
                   (he moves towards the
                   phone - to Melanie)
             Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
   
   He picks it up.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hello.
                   (pause)
             Hey, Jackie...
                   (throwing a hard look at
                   Melanie)
   
   No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
   
                       MELANIE
             I was gonna tell you...
   
   Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
   
   Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
   all the while smiling like a shark.
   
   Louis smiles to himself.
   
   Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
   
   Ordell's on the phone.
   
                       ORDELL
             No, not on the phone, let's meet
             somewhere. But you gotta make sure
             they ain't followin' you...
   
   Louis has the bong in front of him.
   
   Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.
   
                       LOUIS
             Is it ready to go?
   
                       MELANIE
             Yeah, there's another hit left.
   
   Louis takes it.
   
   Ordell's on the phone.
   
   
   INT. COCKATOO INN
   
   Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
   both sides.
   
                       JACKIE
             The Cockatoo Inn.
   
                       ORDELL
             The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
             Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
             brick...
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, wait, you mean that place that
             has the big sign with a rooster on
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's a cockatoo.
   
   Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.
   
                       MELANIE
             You okay?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
             smoke or laugh now it seems without
             coughing.
   
                       MELANIE
             Coughing opens up the capillaries.
             When you cough, you're getting air -
             in this case smoke - to parts of the
             lung that don't normally get used.
             Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
             dad coughs when he smokes all the
             time.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to Louis)
             Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
             So since you like gettin' high so
             much, why don't you stay here with
             Melanie, get high, and watch
             cartoons?
   
   Louis with a smile.
   
                       LOUIS
             Way ahead of you.
   
   Melanie laughs.
   
   Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
   till he finds a channel with cartoons.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you just watch this for the next
             three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
             when I'm through with all my
             business, I'll get high. I get high
             at night. Walk me to the door, space
             girl.
   
   Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
   door,
   
   Ordell says to her in the doorway;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hope you don't mind keeping him
             company.
   
                       MELANIE
             No problem.
   
                       ORDELL
             Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
             they're new.
   
   Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
   look.
   
   Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
             hang with Mel.
   
   Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
   around and looks at Louis.
   
                       MELANIE
             Want a Metrix?
   
                       LOUIS
             What's a Metrix?
   
   She crosses to the kitchen.
   
                       MELANIE
             It's like this major meal in a shake
             you drink instead of having a big
             meal.
   
                       LOUIS
             It's a diet thing?
   
                       MELANIE
             No, it's what body builders drink to
             beef up.
   
                       LOUIS
             No thanks.
   
   She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
   shake.
   
   He looks around and spots something interesting.
   
   
   TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
   
   In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
   sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
   setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
   style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
   face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
   somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
   disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
   
   Louis picks up the photo frame.
   
                       LOUIS
             How old were you here?
   
   She looks and sees what he's talking about.
   
                       MELANIE
             Which one?
   
                       LOUIS
             The roller disco one.
   
                       MELANIE
             Fourteen.
   
   Louis walks over.
   
                       LOUIS
             You're fourteen years old here?
   
                       MELANIE
             Yeah.
   
                       LOUIS
             I thought you were sixteen.
   
                       MELANIE
             I was pretty much the same height now
             as I was then.
   
                       LOUIS
             Were you a disco girl?
   
                       MELANIE
             Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
             I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
             discos.
   
                       LOUIS
             So where did you go?
   
                       MELANIE
             The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
             a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
             girl. I hated disco.
   
   She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
   till she hits Stop!
   
   Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
   looks at the picture.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             That was taken at a place called
             "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were
             you in L.A. back then?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             Where were you?
   
                       LOUIS
             Detroit.
   
                       MELANIE
             With Ordell?
   
                       LOUIS
             We had done time together already.
   
   Melanie drinks her Metrix.
   
                       MELANIE
             Were you a disco guy?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             C'mon, don't lie.
   
                       LOUIS
             I don't like dancing.
   
                       MELANIE
             Did you ever go I one?
   
                       LOUIS
             I went to a few just to meet women.
             But I don't like to dance, and it's
             so fuckin; loud. During that whole
             scene I just drank in bars.
                   (he points to the cut
                   picture)
             Who didn't make the cut?
   
                       MELANIE
             That's a picture of me in Japan.
   
                       LOUIS
             You been to Japan?
   
                       MELANIE
             I lived there for about nine months.
   
                       LOUIS
             You lived in Japan, when?
   
                       MELANIE
             About five years ago.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who's arm is that?
   
                       MELANIE
             That's the guy I lived with... his
             name was... Hir.Hirosh.
   
                       LOUIS
             Must of made quite an impression.
   
                       MEALINE
             I never got to know him, really. I
             couldn't speak Japanese, and his
             English was terrible. But I couldn't
             say anything, because his English was
             better than my Japanese.
   
                       LOUIS
             That sounds like a problem.
   
                       MELANIE
             Not really. We didn't have much to
             say to each other anyway. I never got
             to know him that well, but I knew
             enough to know I wasn't missing much.
             I keep that, because of all the
             fuckin' time I was there, that's the
             only picture I got of me in Japan.
                   (she points beyond her
                   shoulder)
             That's Japan.
   
   Melanie looks up at Louis.
   
                       MELANIE
             Wanna fuck?
   
                       LOUIS
             Sure.

   LOUIS
   
   Lies on the couch on his back and Melanie sits on top of
   him. They're going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys.
   Almost on the fade up, Louis cums.
   
                       MELANIE
             That was fun.
   
   She hops off and OUT OF FRAME.
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, that really hit the spot.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Now that's over, let's get to know
             each other.
   
   
   INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
   
   CLOSEUP a rack of CDs all beginning with "D" are flipped
   through, till it stops on one CD, "The Best of the
   DELFONICS."
   
   Max is standing in he soul music section o a music store.
   He lifts out the CD and turns it over.
   
   It has the song Jackie played this morning.
   
   He smiles and takes the CD up to the register.
   
   CLOSEUP the COCKATOO INN neon sign, unlit during the day.
   
   
   INT. THE COCKATOO INN - DAY
   
   Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
   middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
   drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
   jukebox. He sits next to her.
   
                       ORDELL
             I gotta remember this place. This is
             all right. Two minutes from your
             crib, ten minutes from your work. Not
             bad...
   
   A black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell.
   
                       FLOYD
             What's your drink, brother?
   
                       ORDELL
             Screwdriver.
   
                       FLOYD
                   (to Jackie)
             How you doin'?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm fine.
   
                       FLOYD
             Yes, you are.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
   Floyd makes Ordell's drink.
   
                       ORDELL
             I bet you come here on a Saturday
             night, you need nigga repellent keep
             'em off your ass.
   
                       JACKIE
             I do okay.
   
                       ORDELL
             You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I
             bet you do a damn sight better than
             okay. You think anybody followed you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't think so, but it don't really
             matter. They know I'm meeting you.
   
                       ORDELL
             How the fuck they know that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them.
   
   Floyd comes back with Ordell's screwdriver.
   
                       FLOYD
             Three twenty-five.
   
   Ordell digs in his pocket and gives Floyd a five.
   
                       ORDELL
             Keep it.
   
                       FLOYD
             Thank you, sir.
   
   Floyd leaves.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to Jackie)
             You told em? You told em it's me?
   
                       JACKIE
             They already know it's you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta
             confirm it!
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, the only way I can get
             permission to fly is if I agree to
             help them. Which is what I have to
             appear to be doing. So I give them
             something they already know. You.
   
                       ORDELL
             Didja tell 'em anything else?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them you got a half a million
             dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
             bring it here.
   
   Ordell freaks.
   
                       ORDELL
             You told them that?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's true, isn't it?
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck's that got to do with
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             They know I'm delivering for you. I
             mention the half-million - they don't
             give a fuck about that - They want
             you with guns. So I say, well, if you
             want proof he's getting paid for
             selling them, let me bring the money
             in.
   
                       ORDELL
             What did they say?
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes.
   
   Ordell smiles.
   
   They both slap palms.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY
   
   CLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.
   
   Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
   back, taking bong hits.
   
   As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;
   
                       MELANI
             ... so first he tries to get into the
             cocaine business but realizes right
             away that shit's too competitive.
             Piss the wrong person off, you get
             shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
             over to guns. You can sell guns
             wherever there's a demand. No one
             gives a shit. He acts like he's this
             big international arms dealer, when,
             come on, the only people he ever sold
             to were dopers.
   
   Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
   the coffee table to Melanie.
   
                       LOUIS
             He seems to be making out.
   
   Referring to the bong.
   
                       MELANIE
             Is it dead?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah.
   
   She starts preparing a bowl.
   
                       MELANIE
             Well, so far he is. But you have to
             admit he's not too bright.
   
                       LOUIS
             I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
   
   Melanie still preparing her bowl.
   
                       MELANIE
             He moves his lips when he reads, what
             does that tell ya. Let's say he's
             streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
             still a fuck-up.
   
   She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
   while holding in the smoke, says;
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             He killed a man worked for him the
             other night.
   
                       LOUIS
             So what are you trying to tell me? I
             should get out of here?
   
   Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
   shark smile.
   
                       MELANIE
             That's not what I'm saying at all.
             (pause) You know where he went?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             He went to meet that stewardess.
   
                       LOUIS
             Does that bother you?
   
   Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.
   
                       MELANIE
             Please.
   
                       LOUIS
             You live with him.
   
                       MELANIE
             I live here. He drops in and out. He
             tell you about that half-million
             dollars he's got in Mexico?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh?
   
                       MELANIE
             Course he did, he tells everybody
             who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
             with this stewardess. He's scheming
             how he can get it over here.
   
                       LOUIS
             And your point is?
   
                       MELANIE
             Let him and that stewardess get that
             money over here...
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh?
   
                       MELANI
             ... and just take it from him.
   
   
   INT. COCKATOO INN - DAY
   
   Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.
   
                       JACKI
             ... I make two deliveries. The first
             one with ten thousand, like a dry
             run. They watch it. See how it works.
             Then we do a second delivery, when I
             bring in the half mill.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
             ain't goin anywhere near that money.
   
                       JACKIE
             You don't have to. I told 'em you're
             real careful. You never pick up money
             yourself. You always send someone,
             and I never know who it is.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's a good idea.
   
                       JACKIE
             If you just listen, you'll see it's a
             damn good idea. The first time I do
             it they're lurking about. They see me
             hand the ten thousand to someone.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't know. One of your friends.
   
                       ORDELL
             A woman.
   
                       JACKIE
             If you want.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, I think a woman.
   
                       JACKIE
             The next trip, when I come with all
             the money, it'll look like I hand it
             to the same one I did before...
   
                       ORDELL
             But you don't?
   
                       JACKIE
             No, I give it to someone else first.
   
                       ORDELL
             And they follow the wrong one
             thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's the idea.
   
                       ORDELL
             So we need two people, two women.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can you cover that?
   
                       ORDELL
             I got the woman covered. Where you
             thinkin' about doin' this?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
             the food court.
   
                       ORDELL
             I suppose you see a piece of this for
             yourself?
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, it's my plan. We're in this
             together.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
             need me a partner.
   
                       JACKIE
             I ain't your partner, I'm your
             manager. I'm managing to get your
             money out of Mexico, into America, in
             your hands, and I'm managing to do
             all this under the nose of the cops.
             That makes me your manager, and
             managers get fifteen percent.
   
                       ORDELL
             Managers get ten percent.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's an agent. Manager's get
             fifteen percent.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'll give ya ten.
   
                       JACKIE
             Plus the same deal as before.
   
                       ORDELL
             I can do that.
   
   They clink their glasses together.
   
   
   CLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK
   
   It flips to 11:00 P.M.
   
   It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
   dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
   fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
   
   She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
   takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by
   the bed... she sees that her answering machine is
   flashing. She hits play.
   
   We begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never
   seeing Jackie again.
   
   The machine voice says;
   
                       MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
             You have on message. Sent at 8:06
             P.M.
   
   Max's voice comes out of the machine.
   
                       MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just
             calling to find out how everything
             went today with A.T.F. If you want to
             call me, my home number is 555-6788,
             or you can reach me at my office,
             which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on
             the card I gave you when we first met
             - I don't know if you still have that
             - but it's on it - Oh, let me give
             you my beeper number. It's 555-7839.
             Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope
             everything's well. Bye-bye.
   
                       MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
             End of message.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.
   
   A SUBTITLE reads:
   
   "DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN
   THE WORLD"
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the
   week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's
   not like it is on the weekend.
   
   The international food court, where fast-food versions of
   international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
   Amo Mall shoppers.
   
   Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She
   drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of
   Broadway shopping bags sit on the table.
   
   We join in mid-conversation.
   
                       JACKIE
             The money's in a Broadway shopping
             bag. I get some food, and sit down
             here in the food court. Then your
             girl comes - you got somebody yet?
   
                       ORDELL
             Uh-huh.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who?
   
                       ORDELL
             What'd you care?
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, it's my ass facin' the
             penitentiary. You send some hard-
             headed roc whore, and she fucks
             things up.
   
                       ORDELL
             I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The
             woman's cool, I promise.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY
   
   We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen
   theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early
   seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema,
   having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among
   them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL
   
   In the food court.
   
   Ordell rises from the table.
   
   Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.
   
                       JACKIE
             Don't forget your bag.
   
   He takes it.
   
   We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he
   stops...
   
   ... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.
   
   Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view.
   "What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"
   
   As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food
   court.
   
                       MAX
             walks into the food court. He stands
             looking a all the international fast
             food choices in front of him. As he
             tries to decide, he hears from behind
             him;
   
                       JACKIE (O.S.)
             Max.
   
   Max turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced
   tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him.
   
   Max smiles back.
   
                       MAX
             Well, hello.
   
                       JACKIE
             Surprise.
   
   He approaches her table.
   
                       MAX
             I walked right past you.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, ignoring me. What're you up
             to?
   
                       MAX
             Catching a movie.
   
                       JACKIE
             What'd ya see?
   
                       MAX
             "American Prseident"
   
                       JACKIE
             How was it?
   
                       MAX
             Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening
             are goin steady.
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, are you? Does she know that?
   
                       MAX
             No...
                   (sitting down at the
                   table)
             ... I don't believe she's ever heard
             of me. But that doesn't mean we're
             not going steady.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL
   
   Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at
   Jackie's table.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to himself)
             What's up with this shit.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       MAX
             I think falling in live with movie
             stars is something that happens to a
             man as he gets older.
   
                       JACKIE
             Does it happen to all men?
   
                       MAX
             Well, I'd never be so bold as to
             speak for all men, but as or myself
             and a few of my friends, that's
             definitely the case. There's a lot of
             actresses out there you like, and
             there's some you have crushes on. But
             there's always one who you love. And
             with her it's sorta like going
             steady.
   
                       JACKIE
             And Annette's it for you?
   
                       MAX
             For now. These relationships never
             last too long.
   
   With a smile on her face;
   
                       JACKIE
             That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
             even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
             star.
   
   Max smiles.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who was your girl before Annette?
   
                       MAX
             Sandra Bullock. You know her?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
             bus in "Speed." She's cute.
   
                       MAX
             She's adorable. But I had to end it.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why?
   
                       MAX
             I'm old enough to be her father.
   
                       JACKIE
             How old's Annette?
   
                       MAX
             I don't care.
   
   Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.
   
                       MAX
             What're you, a bag lady?
   
                       JACKIE
             I go back to work tomorrow.
   
                       MAX
             You talk them into it?
   
                       JACKIE
             They seem to like the idea.
   
                       MAX
             Bring the money in and they follow
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
             Put the money in a shopping bag and
             hand it to someone I meet here.
   
                       MAX
             You don't actually do it that way?
   
                       JACKIE
             He always just picked it up at my
             place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
             want to stage it. You know, make it
             look more intriguing, like we know
             what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
             up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
             follow the shopping bag.
   
                       MAX
             Make the delivery somewhere in the
             mall.
   
                       JACKIE
             Right around here, in the food court.
   
                       MAX
             Sit down, leave the bag under the
             table?
   
   Jackie nods her head "yes."
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Will Ordell go for that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm helping him bring his money into
             America. He loves the idea. You just
             missed him.
   
                       MAX
             He was here?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
             That's why all the bags.
   
                       MAX
             I called you last night.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, I got your message. Ray
             wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
             talk about the sting we're plotting.
             That's what he calls it. A sting.
             He's being real nice to me.
   
                       MAX
             You think he's got a thing for you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
             something like he wants the money for
             himself.
   
                       MAX
             I don't follow your logic. What does
             his being nice to you have to do with
             him wanting Ordell's money?
   
                       JACKIE
             He's setting me up to make a
             proposition.
   
                       MAX
             I see.
   
                       JACKIE
             You don't propose something like that
             unless you're pretty sure the other
             person's into it.
   
                       MAX
             Has he hinted around?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really. But I knew this narcotics
             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
             the whole package never gets back to
             the station. His exact words.
   
                       MAX
             You know some interesting people.
   
                       JACKIE
             We weren't bullshittin' either,
             'cause later he was suspended and
             forced to retire.
   
                       MAX
             Has Nicolet told you any colorful
             stories like that?
   
   She shakes her head "no."
   
                       JACKIE
             He tries to act cool.
   
                       MAX
             No harm in that. He's a young guy
             havin' fun being a cop. I know the
             type, trust me on this. He's more
             interested in Ordell than the money.
             If he's gonna do anything suspect,
             it'll be cutting corners to get the
             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
             with the money. It's evidence.
   
                       JACKIE
             What about you Max?
   
                       MAX
             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
   
                       JACKIE
             No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
             were somebody else.
   
                       MAX
             If I saw a way to walk off with a
             shopping bag full of money, would I
             take it?
   
                       JACKIE
             You know where it came from. It's not
             like it's anybody's life savings. It
             wouldn't even be missed.
   
                       MAX
             A half-a-million dollars will always
             be missed.
   
                       JACKIE
             You're avoiding the question.
   
                       MAX
             Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
             Especially now, since I'm getting out
             of the bail bonds business.
   
   Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
   doesn't say anything.
   
   Max continues.
   
                       MAX
             I have to stand behind all my active
             bonds, but I'm not writing any new
             ones.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why?
   
                       MAX
             A lot of reasons. But the main one
             would be I'm tired of it.
   
                       JACKIE
             When did you decide?
   
                       MAX
             It's been a long time coming. I
             finally made up my mind - I guess it
             was Thursday.
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   A RELEASE FORM
   
   With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
   WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
   her, handing her his business card.
   
                       MAX
             Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
             bondsman.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             The day you got me out of jail?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
             guy. I hear he's staying at this
             house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
             come home.
   
                       JACKIE
             Wait a minute. After we were together
             you went and snuck into a guy's
             house?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
   
   FLASH ON
   
   Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
   goodbye.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             I dropped you off...
   
   Max finding no gun in his glove box.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             Went to my office, found out you took
             my gun...
   
   Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
   and a stun gun.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             Got another gun and a stun gun...
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       MAX
             And went to this guy's house in El
             Monte, and I waited for him.
   
                       JACKIE
             What do you do when he comes home?
   
                       MAX
             Shoot him with the stun gun. While
             he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
             'em to County.
   
                       JACKIE
             You do that?
   
                       MAX
             That's my job.
   
                       JACKIE
             Did you do it that night?
   
                       MAX
             He never came home. But I'm sitting
             on the couch, in the dark, holding my
             stun gun and the whole house smells
             of mildew - So after a couple hours I
             think, "What am I doing here?
             Nineteen years of this shit? So I
             made up my mind, that's it.
   
                       JACKIE
             And is that it?
   
                       MAX
             More or less.
   
   Jackie takes a pause before saying;
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not sure you answered my
             question.
   
                       MAX
             Which one?
   
                       JACKIE
             If you had a chance, unemployed now,
             to walk off with a half-million
             dollars, would you take it?
   
                       MAX
             I believe I said I'd be tempted.
   
   Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.
   
                       MAX
             Don't even think about it. You could
             get yourself killed go to prison...
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             What if I've figured a way?
   
   Hold for a few beats, then...
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK.
   
   
   TITLE CARD:
   
   "MONEY EXCHANGE 10,000"
   
   Over this card, we hear an airplane landing.
   
                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Back at work, standing at the exit of her plane. All the
   passengers are filtering out. She says goodbye.
   
                       JACKIE
             Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye
             bye... Bye bye... Goodbye
   
   
   INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
   
   Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
   LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
   her.
   
   Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.
   
                       NICOLET
             We gotta stop meeting this way.
   
   Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's
   Honda.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
   
   The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
   She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the
   passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the
   flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila
   envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is
   very different from the first time they met. The three
   now almost act like friends.
   
                       DARGUS
             How was your flight?
   
                       JACKIE
             Fine.
   
                       DARGUS
             Bet you're happy to be working again.
   
                       NICOLET
             This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,
             Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money
             exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,
             July 4th 1997. The location is the
             parking structure at LAX.
   
                       JACKIE
             What are you doing?
   
   Pointing to a small mike on his lapel.
   
                       NICOLET
             I'm recording this.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were going to let this
             one through.
   
                       DARGUS
             We are. Don't worry about it.
   
                       NICOLET
             Every step of this goes in my report.
                   (back to report voice)
             I am now taking a manila envelope
             from the subject's flight bag.
   
   He opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             The envelope contains currency... all
             the same denomination, one-hundred-
             dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
   
                       DARGUS
             What time do you have to be there?
   
                       JACKIE
             Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's her name?
   
                       JACKIE
             He wouldn't say. You gonna follow
             her?
   
                       DARGUS
             She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
   
                       JACKIE
             But you're not going to stop her?
   
   Nicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up.
   
                       NICOLET
             The envelope contains ten thousand
             dollars. The subject will be
             delivering the currency in a...
   
                       JACKIE
             A Broadway shopping bag.
   
   She holds it up.
   
                       NICOLET
             A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag
             with handles and brown lettering.
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   The huge Del Amo Mall.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   The Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of
   the week.
   
   Max rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually
   strolls through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar
   called "BUSTA CAP" across from the food court. Walking up
   to the counter;
   
                       MAX
             Caf mocha.
   
                       BUSTA CAP GIRL
             You want whipped cream on that?
   
                       MAX
             No, thanks.
   
   Max checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food
   court and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself.
   
                                               FLASH ON:
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Jackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t-
   shirt and panties).
   
                       JACKIE
             Think of it as money that shouldn't
             even be here. I mean does anybody
             have a right to it?
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Max in his office on the phone.
   
                       MAX
             The feds. It's evidence.
   
                       JACKIE
             It may be evidence once they get
             their hands on it, but right now it's
             only money.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AT THE MALL
   
   He ponders his words as he watches her from a distance.
   
   
   INT. FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   Jackie sits at a table by herself, eating Japanese food
   from Teriyaki Donut and drinking an iced tea. As she eats
   she hears;
   
                       YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Is this seat taken?
   
   Jackie looks up and sees a skinny YOUNG GIRL, black,
   quite pretty, no older than twenty.
   
   She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
   beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway
   shopping bag hanging from her arm.
   
                       JACKIE
             Have a seat.
   
   The Young Girl does.
   
   Jackie looks at her tray of food.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             You're hungry?
   
                       YOUNG GIRL
             Yes'm.
   
   It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.
   
                       JACKIE
             Put your bag on the floor, okay?
             Under the table, right next to mine.
   
   The Young Girl who hasn't looked right at Jackie since
   sitting down, bends sideways to glance under the table.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Then when I leave, well, you know.
             What's your name?
   
   She looks up...
   
                       YOUNG GIRL
             Sherona?
   
   ... then back down at her tray.
   
                       JACKIE
             Go ahead, start eating.
   
   Sheronda starts eating, head down, hunching close to the
   tray.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Would it bother you if I smoked?
   
   Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to
   side.
   
   Jackie takes out a pack of Davidoffs and lights one up
   with her yellow Bic. As she does this she observes
   Sheronda eating.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Sheronda, can I ask you a question?
             Are you and Ordell married?
   
   Without raising her head.
   
                       SHERONDA
             He say we like the same thing as
             married.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you live together?
   
   Sheronda hesitates, then says without raising her head.
   
                       SHERONDA
             Most of the times.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not every day?
   
   Sheronda looks up at her...
   
                       SHERONDA
             Sometimes every day, for a while.
   
                       JACKIE
             Then you don't see him for a few
             days?
   
   ... She looks back down.
   
                       SHERONDA
             Yes'm.
   
                       JACKIE
             You know what's in the bag you're
             taking?
   
                       SHERONDA
             He say is a surprise.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking
             to you.
   
   Jackie picks up Sheronda's bag and leaves.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - BUSTA CAP - DAY
   
   Max drinking his caf mocha sans whipped cream, watches
   Jackie leave the Young Girl and with Broadway bag in
   hand, walk out of the food court.
   
   Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
   sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
   Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
   they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
   talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
   serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,
   nods her head again, and then walks off.
   
   As he watches her walk away from the cops...
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   JACKIE AND MAX ON PHONE
   
                       JACKIE
             You said it yourself. Ray wants
             Ordell, he don't give a shit about
             the money. Money won't convict him,
             guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in
             their lap, they take it. If they know
             they got it, they'll look for it...
             but if they don't...
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AT MALL
   
   Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the
   young girl eating in the food court.
   
   Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work
   her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
   to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
   older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
   her the ashtray Jackie was using.
   
   Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up
   from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway
   shopping bag and walks out of the food court.
   
   Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a
   little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.
   
   Max turns back on the older woman all alone.
   
   She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
   carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag. The
   woman heads out of the mall.
   
   Max follows her.
   
   The older woman walks past us. She heads straight for the
   exit.
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY
   
   Max follows the woman outside.
   
   She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan
   Mercury sedan. She drives of...

   number.

             You're rationalizing.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's what you do to go through with
             the shit you start. You rationalize.
             I can do this, Max, I know I can. But
             I can't do it without you.

   Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives

   EXT. STORAGE FACLITY - DAY
   
   Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A
   VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is
   pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             Check this out.
   
   He turns on the flashlight.
   
   He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
   filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
   rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.

                       ORDELL
             Over half-million dollars worth of
             merchandise.
   
   Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start
   unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo.
   
                       LOUIS
             Can I ask you about Melanie?
   
                       ORDELL
             Sure.
   
                       LOUIS
             What's your relationship?
   
                       ORDELL
             She one of the women I got set up. I
             got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
             Simone a small house in Compton, and
             about four blocks away I got me this
             nineteen-year-old country girl named
             Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
             bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
             country as a chicken coop. Took her
             to my house in Compton, told her it
             was Hollywood.
   
                       LOUIS
             She believed you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
             Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
             ever been, anyway.
   
   They both laugh together.
   
                       LOUIS
             Do you trust Melanie?
   
   Ordell stops unloading.
   
                       ORDELL
             If this is about you fucked Melanie,
             I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
             I leave you alone with a bitch like
             Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
             twenty minutes after I'm out the
             door. So say "thank you" and I'll
             tell you, "you're welcome."
   
                       LOUIS
             That's not what I meant when I asked
             did you trust her.
   
   Ordell looks at him.
   
                       ORDELL
             She tryin' to work your ass against
             me, ain't she?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yep.
   
                       ORDELL
             You didn't even hafta say it. I know
             the woman.
   
                       LOUIS
             Well, why the fuck keep her around?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (smiling)
             'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.
             She can't do me no harm. Fact she
             think she can play you against me
             shows how little she knows. You could
             teach that bitch for days how it is
             'tween me an you, she never
             understand a damn word.
   
                       LOUIS
             Why do you let someone know your
             business you can't trust?
   
                       ORDELL
             I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
   
                       LOUIS
             What does that mean?
   
                       ORDELL
             You can't trust Melanie. But you can
             always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
   
   Louis starts unloading.
   
                       LOUIS
             I still don't understand why you keep
             her around.
   
                       ORDELL
             I told you, man.
                   (smiling)
             She my fine little surfer gal.

   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Jackie's finger presses a small black
   button next to the
   handwritten name, "M. RALSTON."
   
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX
   
                       MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   (coming out of it)
             What?
   
   
   JACKIE
   
   Bends down to talk in the speaker.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's Jackie.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
   
   Jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door.
   
   She rings the doorbell.
   
   The door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on
   the other side. Melanie, dressed in a t-shirt, cut offs,
   doesn't say a word - just turns around and walks away.
   
   Once Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the
   apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie;
   
                       ORDEL
             ... Now she's gonna pout...
   
   He turns his attention to Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.
   
   Jackie steps inside.
   
   She sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch.
   
   Ordell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the
   other room to hear;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             She gonna hafta find her sandals...
             find her bag... find her
             sunglasses... take twenty damn
             minutes get her ass out the door.
                   (to Jackie)
             Jackie - his is Louis, Louis -
             Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
             in the other room is Melanie.
   
   Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses,
   sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in
   her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without
   saying nothin' to nobody.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You have a nice time, hear?
   
   The door SLAMS behind her.
   
   Ordell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Drink?
   
                       JACKIE
             I need to talk to you alone.
   
   
   EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY
   
   Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't want no more fuckin'
             surprises. We do this the way I laid
             it out, or we don't do it at all.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the hell you talkin' bout?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sheronda passin' the money onto
             someone else, that's what the hell
             I'm talkin' 'bout.
   
                       ORDELL
             How do you know she did that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was there, I saw her do it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, you weren't supposed to be
             there.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
             figured you'd try an' pull some shit
             like this.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
             no shit. It's my money, I can do
             whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not when it's my ass on the line you
             don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
   
   Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.
   
                       ORDELL
             Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
             ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
             was my friend, Simone. She's the one
             gonna be receiving the money, so I
             just wanted her to see how it works.
             She'll be here any minute. Nice
             woman, you'll like her.
   
   Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
   living room;
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, call Simone and tell her to
             get her tail over here. We're waitin'
             on her ass.
   
   Louis gets up to make the call.
   
   Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
   screwdriver.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
             can't tempt you?
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
   
   Ordell and Jackie sit on stools around the kitchen
   counter/bar. Louis sits with them on the phone, silent.
   
                       JACKIE
             Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the
             airport and mark the bills.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, I don't like that part.
   
                       JACKIE
             It washes off. I tell them we're
             doing it the same way as before.
             They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
             idea of leaving her for a fall.
   
                       ORDELL
             She won't have no problems 'cause she
             don't know nothin'.
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you sure she don' know about the
             money?
   
                       ORDELL
             She don't know shit about the money.
   
                       JACKIE
             What does she think she's gettin?
   
                       ORDELL
             I told her this is a game us rich
             folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a
             scavenger hunt. She didn't know what
             that was neither.
                   (to Louis)
             No answer?
   
   Louis shakes his head.
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hang it up, she's on her way. You
             gotta listen to this. This involves
             you.
   
   Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             No, you gonna give her a
             Robinson's/May bag this time?
   
                       JACKIE
             Right, the one Simone gives me.
             Simone and I'll make the switch at
             Robinson's/May. She knows what I look
             like?
   
                       ORDELL
             She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone
             goes to the dress department with her
             Robinson's/May bag.
   
                       JACKIE
             Designer clothes.
   
                       ORDELL
             She waits for you to go in the place
             where you try things on.
   
                       JACKIE
             The fitting room. There's a sign over
             the door.
   
                       LOUIS
             Why we doin' I there?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
             me. We can't risk switching bags out
             in the open or even in the dining
             area. That's why it has to be a
             woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
             fitting room.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you come out with her
             Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
             Simone peeks out, waits for my man
             Louis here to give her a signal
             nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
             store, gets in her car - mission
             accomplished.
   
                       JACKIE
             Where you gonna be during all this?
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar
             In downtown L.A. till my man over
             here calls me and gives me the O.K.
             sign.
   
   Jackie's pager goes off. She looks at it.
   
                       JACKIE
             I gotta go.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY
   
   Ordell walks Jackie to the elevator.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who's paging you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
   
                       ORDELL
             That works on my nerves, you bein' so
             buddy-buddy with him.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now
             once I deliver I'll have to trust
             you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, I've been trusting you all this
             time, haven't I? We agreed on ten
             percent of what you bring in and
             that's what you gonna get.
   
   They reach the elevator. She presses the button.
   
                       JACKIE
             And a hundred thousand if I go to
             jail.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't
             gonna screw you. You haven't told me
             where I put it for you.
   
   The elevator arrives. Jackie steps in.
   
                       JACKIE
             Give it to the bail bondsman, Max
             Cherry. He'll take care of it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Max Cherry? You and him friends now?
             You tell him about this shit?
   
                       JACKIE
             He won't know where the money came
             from. Only that it's money.
   
   ... the elevator shuts... As it shuts Ordell yells;...
   
                       ORDELL
             Don't you know all them bail bondsmen
             are crooks...
   
   ... the door shuts.
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   He doesn't like the last piece of new information.
   
   
   EXT. THE STRAND - DAY
   
   The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa
   Beach. Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to
   her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called,
   "Sally Leroy's."
   
   
   INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY
   
   Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different
   beer signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis
   Presley, James Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding
   monster waves all over the place.
   
   The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.
   
   
   BEGINNING OF SHOT
   
   The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
   into the place and going up to the bar...
   
   A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
   workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you have a phone?
   
                       WANDA
             Yeah, it's in the back.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks.
   
   ... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
   MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
   older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
   like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
   As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
   head of hair comes into the f.g....
   
   The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
   on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
   Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.
   
   END OF SHOT
   
   Jackie hears behind her;
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Hey!
   
   Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing
   behind her.
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, hi.
   
                       MELANIE
             Buy ya a beer?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm waiting for the phone.
   
                       MELANIE
             Good luck. That guy's been in there
             since I got here.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I guess I better look for
             another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
   
   Jackie turns to leave.
   
                       MELANIE
             I know what you and Ordell got goin'.
             You sit down and have a beer with me.
             I'll tell you a secret.
   
   Jackie looks at her a moment.
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
                       MELANIE
             Great...
                   (calling to the
                   bartender)
             ... Wanda!
   
   Wanda approaches.
   
                       WANDA
             What?
   
                       MELANIE
             This lady is thirsty.
   
                       WANDA
             What do you want?
   
                       MELANIE
             What's on tap?
   
                       WANDA
             Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and
             Killian's Red.
   
                       JACKIE
             Killian's.
   
                       MELANIE
             Better get me another Sam's.
                   (to Jackie)
             Join me in a Jaeger shot?
   

                       JACKIE
             Uh-uh.
             
                       MELANIE
             Gimme one anyway.
   
                       WANDA
             You got it.
             
   Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The
   MUSIC is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie
   moves her head to it during the conversation.
   
                       JACKIE
             How long you been with Ordell?
   
                       MELANIE
             This time? Almost a year. I've known
             him forever.
   
                       JACKIE
             What were you two fighting about?
   
                       MELANIE
             He told me to go outside.
                   (imitating Ordell's
                   voice)
             "You may leave us now." It's all part
             of his pathetic attempt to be "the
             man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
   
   Jackie nods "yes."
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about
             Ordell.
   
                       JACKIE
             That coke was yours, wasn't it?
   
   Melanie makes a face to show pain.
   
                       MELANIE
             Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about
             that. I hope they don't come down on
             you on my account. Ordell shoulda
             told you it was in your bag.
   
   Wanda brings the drinks.
   
                       WANDA
             Seven dollars.
   
   Melanie digs in her purse for the money.
   
                       JACKIE
             He said he didn't know about it.
   
                       MELANIE
                   (digging in her purse)
             You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess
             you have to trust him.
                   (pulls out a ten)
             I'd have second thoughts on that, but
             then I know 'em.
   
   Melanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then
   continues.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             He killed a guy who works for him the
             other day.
   
                       JACKIE
             Beaumont Livingston?
   
                       MELANIE
             You already knew that?
   
                       JACKIE
             Kinda.
   
                       MELANIE
             So tell me. Having all that money in
             your flight bag - Is it tempting?
   
   Jackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to
             carry in ten thousand dollars, that
             would be the last motherfuckin' time
             he saw me. The next trip you're gonna
             have over half-a-million. If you
             thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure
             as hell wouldn't blame you.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             You think I'm kidding?
   
                       JACKIE
             Dreaming.
   
                       MELANIE
             You know how easy it would be? He
             won't be anywhere near that mall.
             Pull one more switch, up front.
             That's it. half-a-million dollars.
             Need help?
   
                       JACKIE
                   (smiling)
             Keep it between us girls?
   
                       MELANIE
             What's that fucker ever done for us?
   
                       JACKIE
                   (getting off the
                   barstool)
             I don't think so, but thanks for the
             beer.
   
   Jackie leaves.
   
   
   CLOSEUP MELANIE
   
   Watches her go.
   
                       MELANIE
                   (softly under her breath)
             Chicken shit.
   
   
   INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
   
   Jackie and Nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak
   dinner. Nicolet drinks beer, Jackie drinks white wine.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell has a white guy working for
             him named Louis.
   
                       NICOLET
             You two meet?
   
                       JACKIE
             This afternoon before I came here. He
             was with Ordell at an apartment in
             Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he
             lives there, but I can find out.
   
                       NICOLET
             You talk to him?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really.
   
                       NICOLET
             His full name is Louis Gara. He just
             got out from serving four years in
             Susanville.
   
                       JACKIE
             What for?
   
                       NICOLET
             Bank robbery? Do you know what he
             does for Ordell?
   
                       JACKIE
             I imagine shit needs to be done.
   
                       NICOLET
             We've been following Mr. Gara, and
             he's definitely working for Ordell.
   
                                               FLASH ON:
   
   
   NICOLET AND DARGUS
   
   In a car, parked, on surveillance.
   
   
   COPS POV
   
   Louis with the van, at the storage facility.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             They served two years together almost
             twenty years ago in Soledad. But he
             doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.
             Ordell's got him staying at a house
             in.
   
   
   MUG SHOT SIMONE
   
   The older woman in the mall.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             ... Compton with a fifty-six-year-
             old petty thief - woman named Simone
             Hawkins.
   
   
   BACK TO BAR
   
                       NICOLET
             Ever meet her, or they talk about
             her?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not yet.
   
                       NICOLET
             Who's the other one?
   
                       JACKIE
             White girl named Melanie Ralston.
             Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's her story?
   
                       JACKIE
             It was her coke I got busted with.
             She knows everything, but she's not
             part of it, and she's pissed cause
             she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't
             even let her stay at the meeting. She
             tried to talk me into ripping off
             Ordell.
   
                       NICOLET
             And splittin' with her?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm sure that was the idea.
   
                       NICOLET
             What did you say?
   
                       JACKIE
             I smiled and walked away. She also
             told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
   
                       NICOLET
             She told you that?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             Was she there?
   
                       JACKIE
             She didn't say.
   
                       NICOLET
             But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well, this sounds like a lady I'd
             like to have a word with. So
             everything's set for tomorrow?
   
                       JACKIE
             Right. Everything's the same, except
             one change...
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
   white wine.
   
   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
   
   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
   what she wants them to think.
   
   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
   an all-important competition.
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them Ordell's changed the
             amount he's bringing in.
   
                       MAX
             Do you think they bought it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
             Ordell's real nervous. They love
             thinking he's scared of them.
   
                       MAX
             You know, a good cop won't let you
             know he knows you're fulla shit.
   
                       JACKIE
             All he needed was a reasonable
             explanation.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET
   
   MEDIUM JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             Right. Everything's the same except
             one change. Ordell thinks it's just
             too hot right now to bring in all his
             money. He knows you're watching him,
             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
             stash where it is, but he wants to
             bring in fifty thousand for bail in
             case he needs it.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX
   
                       MAX
             It'll be more than that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
   
                       MAX
             But you still have to show him the
             money at the airport.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, you know I'm not going to show
             him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
             thousand.
   
                       MAX
             Where's the rest of it?
   
                       JACKIE
             In the bag underneath.
   
                       MAX
             What if he checks it?
   
                       JACKIE
             He won't - I mean, he didn't the last
             time. He'll be expecting fifty
             thousand and there it is - on top.
   
                       MAX
             You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.
             Walker put the money in, and I didn't
             know nothing about it. Like the coke.
   
                       MAX
             Then you're out and you get nothing.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I
             tried.
   
                       MAX
             You're gonna have surveillance all
             over you.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why you don't make a move till
             I come out of the fitting room.
   
                       MAX
             In a dress.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, a suit. There's one I had my
             eye on.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Excuse me.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone
   
                       ORDELL
             It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
             in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout
             - everything's the same - except for
             one change. That bitch you saw in the
             mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,
             cause she split on me.
                   (pause)
             Me an Louis went over to her place
             ,she's gone. She's gone and all her
             shit's gone and so's my ten thousand
             dollars.
                   (pause)
             It ain't nothin' to worry about,
             girl. Everything's just like we
             discussed. Except when you do the
             switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna
             be Melanie.
   
   Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
   Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
   watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.
   
   
   ON TV
   
   Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
   pursued by police cars.
   
   They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
   Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
   foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
   gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.

   Cabo, flying towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind
   it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black

   and ties I all down tight. Then places a fat envelope
   with fifty thousand right on top.

   Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle,
   and is stopped by a PASSENGER.

             Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink
             and you spend half the fuckin' flight
             in the can. Soon as we land I'm
             making a formal complaint.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why, because I called you an asshole.
   
                       PASSENGER
             You didn't call me that.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't? Oh, well, you're an

   Waiting for her is Ray Nicolet.
   
                       NICOLET
             We have to stop meeting like this.
   
   They fall into step towards her car.
   
                       JACKIE
             You said that the last time.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well, it's true, isn't it? After his
             is buttoned up we could meet
             someplace else. What do you think?
   
                       JACKIE
             We could, if I'm not in jail.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, that's taken care of. I called
             the State Attorney's Office. You were

   JACKIE'S POV
   
   Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back
   at Jackie.
   
                       NICOLET
             Free as a bird. I still expect you to
             finish the job, though. How much do
             you have this time?
   
   Jackie starts walking again
   
                       JACKIE
             Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
             pretty sure he's gonna need it for
             bail.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
   
   Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight
   bag in his lap.
   
   He unzips it.
   
   He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.
   
   Jackie watches all of this.
   
                       NICOLET
             That's fifty thousand, huh? It
             doesn't look like that much.
   
                       JACKIE
             I was told ten thousand in each pack.
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't count it?
   
                       JACKIE
             I never have. It's not my money.
   
   He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through
   the folds of a skirt.
   
                       NICOLET
             He might have slipped some coke in
             here. Did you check?
   
   Jackie, cool.
   
                       JACKIE
             Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
             that again.
   
   Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged
   into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over
   to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five
   rubber-banded bond packets of loot.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Ever been tempted?
   
                       NICOLET
             What? To put one of these in my
             pocket?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             If I did, I'd have to give you one,
             wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
             want. No one knows how much there is
             except us, right?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes. All those things are true.
   
                       NICOLET
             After all, it don't belong to nobody,
             right?
   
                       JACKIE
             That would be one point of view.
   
                       NICOLET
             Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
             that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
             evidence, it belongs to us. You are
             now officially out of trouble. Don't
             do nothing stupid, now.
   
                       JACKIE
             How can I do anything if I'm being
             watched every second?
   
                       NICOLET
             I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
             the trouble of pointing it out to
             you.
                   (holding up the money)
             Put this in your shopping bag. It's
             what I expect to find when I look in
             Sheronda's. Comprende?

   Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
   retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.

   goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines
   the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
   
   Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
   fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
   thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
   envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
   the rest of the bag with beach towels.
   
   Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
   carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
   confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
   the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.

             Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
             on.
   
   Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
   sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
   
   Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.
   
                       JACKIE
             This looks pretty good on me.
   
                       AMY
             Are you kidding, it looks great. You
             wear this to a business meeting,
             you're the badass in the room. But
             you can go out dancing in this too.
             It's a total power suit.
   
   Jackie studies her reflection.
   
                       JACKIE
             I think I'm gonna just get this for
             today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
             you mind ringing this up while I
             change out of it?
   
                       AMY
             Not a problem.
   
                       JACKIE

   Jackie walks into the fitting room.
   
   
   INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY
   
   She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
   cubicles on her right, enters the last one.
   
   She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
   her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.
   
   A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
   looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
   next to her.
   
   Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.
   
                       MEALNIE (O.S.)
             Jackie?
   
                       JACKIE
             Hi, Melanie.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Are you getting that black suit?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, do you like it?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             It looks good on you.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you got something for me?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             You betcha.
   
   A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
   comes sliding underneath the stall.
   
   Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
   books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.
   
   She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
   and lies it on top of the bag.
   
   As she does all this Melanie continues talking.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             We coulda worked this. You know that,
             dontcha? You would've made out a lot
             better than you're going to, believe
             me.
   
   Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
   stall.
   
   Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.
   
                       JACKIE
             I put a little cherry on top. You're
             right. What the hell he ever do for
             us?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
                   (quietly)
             Thanks.
   
                       JACKIE
             Now be careful with that bag. You
             don't want it ripping open on you in
             the middle of the store.
   
   We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
   
   Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
   of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
   sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
   
   Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
   She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
   Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.
   
   
   INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
   
   Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
   frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
   counter where Amy waits for her.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
             the suit - get out of that damn
             uniform.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, that's not a problem.
   
   As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
   the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
   RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
   as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
   
   She leaves. We follow her...
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   ... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
   main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
   Jackie is completely gone.
   
   She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
   to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
   twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
   she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
   tears.
   
   As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
             took the money.
   
   The CAMERA stops twirling.
   
   Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come
   running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her,
   a frantic Jackie yells;
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Melanie burst in the dressing room
             and took the money!

                       MELANIE
             Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
   
                       LOUIS
             We shoulda been there already and we
             woulda been if it hadn't been for
             your fuckin' around!
   
   They go inside Robinson's/May...
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
   
   ... We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose
   them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins,
   but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking
   in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes
   floor.
   
                       AM
             ... You wear this to a business
             meeting, you're the badass in the
             room...
   
   We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
   watching Jackie.
   
                       MELANIE
             That's a nice outfit on her. I'm
             gonna go over and look at this Michi
             Moon display.
   
                       LOUIS
             Just stay right fuckin' here, all
             right?
   
                       MELANIE
             Are you sweating?
   
   Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
   dampness.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Job a little too much for you?
   
   Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.
   
   Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
   a natural-born smart ass to change.
   
                       MELANIE
             I'll be over here. You're too
             conspicuous.
   
   Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
   inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
   him.
   
   He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
   time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
   
                       LOUIS
                   (under his breath)
             Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
   
   He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
   much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
   something that stops him cold.
   
   
   MAX CHERRY
   
   Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
   fitting room.
   
   He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
   
   Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
   staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
   Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
   to do what he was doing.
   
   He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
   any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
   Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
   register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
   there are doing customer stuff.
   
   Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
   and head down a different aisle.
   
   He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
   fight is said tense and low.
   
                       LOUIS
             What are you doin'?
   
                       MELANIE
             I'm getting out of here. What do you
             think?
   
                       LOUIS
             Lemme have the bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Fuck you. I can carry it.
   
   She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
   and pulls her around.
   
                       LOUIS
             Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
   
                       MELANIE
             Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
             fuckin' bag?
   
                       LOUIS
             Gimme that bag before I knock you out
             and take it.
   
   Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
   that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
   the bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
             wrong with you?
   
   He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
   them.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm carrying it.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
             pill, for christ sake.
   
   Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
   through gritted teeth;
   
                       LOUIS
             Fuck you with your chill pill.
   
   In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;
   
                       MELANIE
             Remember where we came in?
   
   Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
                   (like a teacher on Romper
                   Room)
             Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
             in through Bullocks. I know where it
             is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
   
   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
   smirk, follows behind.
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
   
   Melanie follows close behind.
   
   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
   see he has a searching look on his face.
   
                       MELANIE
             You have no idea where you parked, do
             you?
   
   Louis doesn't answer.
   
   Melanie laughs.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Jesus, but if you two aren't the
             biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
             life... How did you ever rob a bank?
             When you robbed banks, did you have
             to look for your car then too? No
             wonder you went to jail.
   
   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
   up.
   
   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, down the end.
   
                       MELANIE
             You sure?
   
   They walk it; it's not it.
   
   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
   next one.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Is it this aisle or the next one
             over?
   
                       LOUIS
             This one.
   
                       MELANIE
             You sure?
   
   In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
   
                       LOUIS
             Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
             telling you, keep your mouth shut.
   
   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
   
                       LOUIS
             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
             word.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, Lou-is.
   
   That did it!
   
   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
   her... BAM... in the belly.
   
   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
   
   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
   
   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
   
   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
   HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
   
                       LOUIS
             See, just where I fuckin' said it
             was!
   
   He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
   
   We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
   cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
   and yells through the passenger window;
   
                       LOUIS
             Hey, look. I found it!
   
   He drives away.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
   in the parking lot.
   
   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TIME: 4:04"
   
   Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
   Del Amo Mall.
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
   
   Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
   Robinson's/May store.
   
   He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
   the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
   
                       SALESGIRL
             Can I show you something?
   
                       MAX
             Not right now. I'm just killing time
             waiting for my wife. But thanks,
             anyway.
   
                       SALESGIRL
             Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
             don't be shy.
   
                       MAX
             Thanks, I won't.
   
   She goes off.
   
   He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
   out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
   
   Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
   
   Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
   his breath;
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (low)
             And away we go.
   
   Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
   a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
   
   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
   Clothes.
   
   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
   on a rack.
   
   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
   
   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
   
   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
   
   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
   
   Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
   the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
   his before he can see a reaction.
   
   Max continues his fake browsing.
   
   He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
   Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
   
   She and Louis disappear.
   
   He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
   Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
   cash, then leaves stopping to say;
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
   
   She's gone.
   
   Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
   
   It's Max's turn.
   
   As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
   he says to himself;
   
                       MAX
             Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
             years dealing with people who take
             incredible risks. You walk over to
             that counter, you're gonna find out
             what it's like.
   
   Max takes a few moments...
   
   ... then walks over to Amy.
   
                       MAX
             Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
             left a bag of beach towels in the
             fitting room?
   
                       AMY
             Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
             get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
             think they're in the last stall.
   
                       MAX
             Thanks.
   
   Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
   the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
   
   He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
   towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
   Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
   
                       MAX
             Got 'em, thanks.
   
                       AMY
             Sure thing.
   
   Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
   parking lot.
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
   
   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
   He made it. It worked.
   
   Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
   his half-a-million bucks and drives away.
   
   
   INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY
   
   Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
   and watching a stripper strip.
   
                       BARTENDER
             There a Ordell here?
   
                       ORDELL
             That's me.
   
   The bartender hands him the phone.
   
                       BARTENDER
             Don't talks all day.
   
   Ordell takes the receiver.
   
   
   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
   
   A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on
   Ordell's tiny cellular.
   
                       LOUIS
             It's Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (now into phone)
             Did you get it?
   
                       LOUIS
             I got it. Listen, there's something
             else I have to tell you.
   
                       ORDELL
             When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
             You count the money?
   
                       LOUIS
             I haven't even looked at it yet, it's
             still in the shopping bag.
   
                       ORDELL
             Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
                   (pause)
             Louis.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's what I got to talk to you
             about. You see, Melanie was giving me
             a hard time -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Not now, pick me up.
   
   Louis hears the phone disconnect.
   
   
   EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR - DAY
   
   The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
   in, the car takes off.
   
   
   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
   
   Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
   backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
   lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.
   
                       ORDELL
             You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
             they got all them car dealerships.
             We're gonna leave this heap in a
             parking lot and get one the cops
             don't know about.
                   (pause)
             Hey, where's Melanie?
   
                       LOUIS
             That's what I gotta tell you. She
             bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
             with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
             carry the bag. Started running her
             fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
             right away when we came out where the
             car was parked, so she got on me
             about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
             is it that one?" She was totally
             fuckin' with my nerves.
   
                       ORDELL
             So what, you left her there.
   
                       LOUIS
             I shot her.
   
   Ordell just looks at him.
   
                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
             I expect she's dead.
   
   Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;
   
                       ORDELL
             You shot Melanie?
   
                       LOUIS
             Twice. In the parking lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Couldn't talk to her?
   
                       LOUIS
             You know how she is.
   
                       ORDELL
             You couldn't just hit her?
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe... but at that moment... I
             dunno...
   
                       ORDELL
             You shot her twice?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you're sure she's dead.
   
                       LOUIS
             Pretty sure.
   
                       ORDELL
             Where did you shoot her?
   
                       LOUIS
             In the chest and stomach.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, if you had to do it, you had to
             do it. What we don't want is that
             bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
             that woman.
   
   Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
   pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
   top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
   looks inside the bag for the longest time.
   
   Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (quiet)
             Louis?
   
                       LOUIS
                   (not looking at him)
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             Where's the rest of it?
             
                       LOUIS
                   (looking at him)
             How much it there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
   
                       LOUIS
             You said five hundred and fifty!
   
                       ORDELL
                   (calm)
             So you light, ain't you. You light
             about a half-a-million.
   
                       LOUIS
             Look, that's the bag she came out
             with. She never even put her hand in
             it, and neither did I.
   
                       ORDELL
             Came outta where?
   
                       LOUIS
             The fitting room. It went down
             exactly the way it was supposed to.
   
                       ORDELL
             How long was she in there?
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe a minute. She came right out.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
   
                       LOUIS
             Look, I swear to fucking god, she
             came out with that bag and I took it
             from her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then what?
   
                       LOUIS
             We went to the parking lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Where you shot her.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's right.
   
                       ORDELL
             You sure she ain't somewhere with a
             half-a-million dollars I worked my
             ass off to earn?
   
   Louis looks at Ordell;
   
                       LOUIS
                   (quietly)
             Fuck you for asking me that.
   
                       ORDELL
             Pull the car over.
   
   Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             What'd you shoot her with?
   
                       LOUIS
             It's in there.
   
   Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
   smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.
   
                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
             What's that gonna tell you" If I was
             really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
             two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
             trusted me.
   
   Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   He thinks.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and
   saying with a smile;
   
                       JACKIE
             Gotcha, nigga.
   
                                               DISSOLVE BACK
                                               TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the
   Beretta.
   
                       ORDELL
             Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
   
                       LOUIS
             If she's got it, why didn't she take
             it all?
   
                       ORDELL
             'fore I blow that bitch's brains out,
             I'll ask her.
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe the Feds got it.
   
                       ORDELL
             If there were nothin; in here but
             towels, maybe she didn't get a chance
             to take it from her suitcase and
             A.T.F. got it. But, she put these
             fuckin' books in here to trick our
             ass.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's why I never checked it. The
             bag felt right.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then she throws forty thousand in
             here, to rub the shit in my face,
             know what I'm saying? She wants me to
             know she ripped me off.
   
                       LOUIS
             I don't know. Either she has it or
             the Feds.
   
                       ORDELL
             Or...
                   (pause)
             ... she gave it to somebody else
             first, before Melanie went in the
             dressing room.
   
   It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers
   something.
   
                       LOUIS
             Jesus Christ.
   
                       ORDELL
             What?
   
                       LOUIS
             You know who I saw in the dress
             department?
   
                       ORDELL
             Tell me.
   
                       LOUIS
             I didn't really think anything of it.
             No - I did wonder what he was doing
             there, but didn't think it had
             anything to do with us. You know like
             maybe he was there with his wife or
             girlfriend.
   
                       ORDELL
             You gonna tell me who it was?
   
                       LOUIS
             Max Cherry.
   
   Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then
   looks back.
   
                       ORDELL
             You see Max Cherry in the dress
             department. We're about to be handed
             half-a-million dollars - Man, look at
             me when I'm talking to you! And you
             don't think nothing of him being
             there!
   
                       LOUIS
             Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
             each other?
   
                       ORDELL
             Hell, yes, they know each other. He
             bonded her out of county.
   
                       LOUIS
             How am I supposed to know that?
   
                       ORDELL
             You know the motherfucker's a bail
             bondsman, don't ya? You know every
             last one of them motherfuckers is
             crooked as hell?
   
                       LOUIS
             Why should I think anything's weird,
             if I don't know nothin' about them
             knowing each other?
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, I don't want to hear your
             fuckin' excuses!
   
   Louis gets mad.
   
                       LOUIS
             I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,
             I'm givin' you reasons.
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
             lost all the goddam money I got in
             the world! Let me tell you the
             reason, motherfucker! The reason is,
             your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
   
   Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
   Ordell;
   
                       LOUIS
                   (hard)
             You best back off.
   
   We hear a BAM.
   
   Louis jerks.
   
   Ordell shot him.
   
   Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
   staring at Ordell.
   
   Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
   Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.
   
   This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
   He slumps over - his life gone.
   
   Ordell looks at him.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck happened to you, man?
             Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.
   
   Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving
   Louis' dead body there.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   MEDIUM NICOLET
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't tell me you were gonna do
             some shopping.
   
   
   INT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) - DAY
   
   Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a
   chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers
   of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of
   coffee in he other.
   
   Ray stands.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought I did.
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't. I would think with all
             this on your mind, you'd wait till
             after.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got there early. I've had my eye on
             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
             got there early. The idea was to try
             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
             did, get them to wrap it up, and
             change back into my uniform. That's
             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
             with fifty thousand, and go home.
   
                       NICOLET
             But you didn't do that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
             swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
             it.
                   (pause)
             And someone killed her for it.
   
   Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.
   
                       NICOLET
             Where's the bag she gave you?
   
                       JACKIE
             She didn't give me one. I told you
             before, Melanie wasn't part of the
             plan. Ordell must of told her to do
             it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
             bag, and takes off. What am I
             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
             my fucking underwear. I had to get
             dressed before I could do anything.
             So I put this back on 'cause could
             put this on faster than I could my
             uniform.
   
                       NICOLET
             You took the time to pay the
             saleswoman.
   
                       JACKIE
             I had to. I was frantic. I didn't
             know what to do.
   
                       NICOLET
             What did you do after that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I went looking for you. I went
             straight to the bookstore, 'cause
             that's where you were last time, but
             you weren't there. How the hell else
             am I supposed to let anybody know
             what happened? You didn't tell me how
             to do that, did you? I knew I was
             under surveillance, so when I
             couldn't spot anybody, I started
             yelling.
   
                       NICOLET
             There was a guy with Melanie?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not in the fitting room.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT
   
   Pretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             We had our agent on you. She sees a
             blonde come out of the fitting room
             carrying a Robinson's/May bag and
             tussle with a tough-looking white
             guy. The white guy takes the shopping
             bag and they go.
   
   
   BACK TO OFFICE
   
                       NICOLET
             This guy with Melanie, that was Louis
             Gara?
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't see him. I was in my
             underwear. If it was a white guy, it
             was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
   
                       NICOLET
             It's possible. You're saying you
             don't have any idea what happened to
             that fifty thousand?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have no idea.
   
                       NICOLET
             You'd take a polygraph on it?
   
                       JACKIE
             If it'll make you happy.
   
                       NICOLET
             I sure hope you haven't done anything
             dumb Jackie.
   
   Dargus comes to the doorway...
   
                       DARGUS
                   (to Nicolet)
             Can I have a word with you?
   
                       NICOLET
             Sure.
   
   They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the
   room, smoking.
   
   They both come back in.
   
   Nicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner
   saying nothing.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
             dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
             lost Ordell.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were watching him.
   
                       NICOLET
             We were, and we lost him. He walked
             into a strip bar sometime around
             three thirty and never came out. The
             bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
             and-a-half from where Louis was found
             dead. It looks like Louis's friend
             shot him twice at point blank range.
   
                       JACKIE
             So what happens now?
   
                       NICOLET
             We pick up Ordell. We've got three
             murders we can link him to. We have
             the storage unit where he keeps his
             guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
             warrant to go in and get him. And we
             have you.
   
                       JACKIE
             What about me?
   
                       NICOLET
             What about you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you think I took some of that
             money?
   
                       NICOLET
             I have no evidence of your taking
             anything. You didn't pay for your
             snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
             was glad to see that. You've been
             helping us out, you gave us Melanie
             and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
             marked bills stuffed in her shorts
             when they found her, which goes a
             long way backing up your story.
   
   Jackie listens.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             I'll settle for Ordell with the
             marked bills.
   
                       NICOLET
             If you have something else going on
             you haven't told me about, it's
             between you and Ordell. All I gotta
             say is, you better hope we find him
             before he finds you.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   On the phone.
   
                       ORDEL
             ... I can't leave here today... Mr.
             Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I
             get my money... You wouldn't have
             that fuckin' boat weren't for me.
             Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my
             friends are... Mr. Walker?
   
   
   INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - DAY
   
   Ordell turn to a glassy-eyed black female junkie nodding
   on the couch named RAYNELLE. The filthy apartment we're
   in belongs to her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Can you believe that shit?
             Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate
             nigger. Do things for people and
             that's how they treat you. Goddamn
             girl, how can you live like this?
   
   He dials another number.
   
                       RAYNELLE
                   (stoned)
             Like what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Girl, this shit is repugnant.

             Let me speak to Max Cherry.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Winston behind his desk, on the phone.
   
                       WINSTON
             He ain't here right now.
   
                       ORDELL
             He leave town?
   
                       WINSTON
             He's around.
   
                       ORDELL
             Give me his home number.
   
                       WINSTON
             I'll give you his beeper.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A YOUNG BLACK COMEDIAN ON TV
   
   Def Comedy Jam plays on TV, a black comedian does a nasty
   stand-up routine.
   
   
   INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell and Raynelle sit on the couch watching Def Comedy
   Jam; neither one is laughing. Raynelle's too stoned.
   Ordell's too tense. The phone rings, he jumps on it
   
                       ORDELL
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on
   the edge of the desk listening.
   
                       MAX
             I've been looking for you.
   
   Ordell's up and off the couch pacing.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know who this is?
   
                       MAX
             Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the
             ten thousand you put up. Isn't that
             why you called.
   
   Ordell doesn't say anything.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             The bond collateral on Beaumont
             Livingston you moved over to cover
             Miss Brown, remember?
   
                       ORDELL
             She got off, huh?
   
                       MAX
             They decided to no-file. Tell me
             where you are and I'll bring you your
             money.
   
   Ordell doesn't say anything.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You still there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Looky here, I know you helped her and
             I know you know what I want Jackie
             can tell me any story come in that
             pretty head of hers. Long as at the
             end of that story, she hands over my
             money. She do that, we're still
             friends. Now, she don't wanna be my
             friend no more, tell her to think
             about ol' Louis. And if she tries to
             turn me in, I'll name her ass as my
             accessory. We'll go upstate together.
             Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that
             shit's a promise, understand what I'm
             sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll
             call you back.
   
   Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One
   of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs.
   
   Max looks at Winston.
   
                       MAX
             You're right, that was Ordell. You
             have time, you think you could find
             out for me where he's staying?
   
                       WINSTON
             Cops can't locate him, huh?
   
                       MAX
             They don't have your winning
             personality.
   
                       WINSTON
             Sure thing. I don't have to know what
             I'm doing, long as you know.
   
                       MAX
             I think I do. Is that good enough?
   
   
   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
   rooms.
   
   
   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
   
   Jackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and
   panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.
   
   She answers the phone.
   
                       JACKIE
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT
   
   Max on the phone in his office, alone.
   
                       MAX
             I know where he is.
   
   This gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the
   TV set and zaps the sound.
   
                       JACKIE
             How'd you find out?
   
                       MAX
             All Winston had to do was ask around.
             Ordell's living in Long Beach with a
             woman junkie.
   
                       JACKIE
             How does Winston find him if A.T.F.
             and all the local Police can't?
   
                       MAX
             People talk to Winston. He's street,
             same as them, they trust him. They
             get busted, they know somebody who
             can bond them out. I thought I might
             drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
             surprised to see me.
   
                       JACKIE
             He's liable to shoot you.
   
                       MAX
             On the phone I told him I have the
             ten thousand he put up for your bond.
             I could bring the money and the
             papers for him to sign. Walk out and
             call the Sheriff's department.
   
   Jackie gets off the bed.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray wants him.
   
                       MAX
             Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
             suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
             him in, he's gonna name you as an
             accessory.
   
   Jackie lights up a Davidoff.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
             case. I'm their witness. They
             wouldn't have a case without me. If
             it's his word against mine, who are
             they gonna believe?
   
                       MAX
             It's not that simple.
   
   Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins
   pacing back and forth.
   
                       JACKIE
             It never was, so I'm not gonna start
             worrying about it now. Look, Ray more
             or less believes my story, and he
             more or less doesn't care. All he
             really gives a shit about is getting
             Ordell.
   
                       MAX
             So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
   
                       JACKIE
             Get Ordell to come to your office.
   
                       MAX
             Set him up.
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MAX
             Tell him you want to see him?
   
                       JACKIE
             Tell him I want to give him his
             money.
   
                       MAX
             Why?
   
                       JACKIE
             I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
             him. He'll like that.
   
                       MAX
             What do you tell Nicolet?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell called and wants to meet me
             and I'm scared.
   
                       MAX
             We get Ordell to come to my office.
             Nicolet - is he already there, or
             does he come busting in while we're
             chatting?
   
   Jackie takes a drag.
   
                       JACKIE
             He's already there.
   
                       MAX
             What if he hears something he's not
             supposed to?
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, we don't let that happen, now
             do we?
   
   
   EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds
   on the door.
   
   Ordell throws open the door.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck you doin' knockin on
             the door like the goddamn police? You
             lookin' to get shot?
   
                       MAX
             I thought you might be asleep.
   
                       ORDELL
             You keep fuckin' with me, you're
             gonna be asleep forever.
   
   He looks past Max.
   
                       MAX
             I'm alone.
   
                       ORDELL
             Git your ass in here.
   
   Max enters, Ordell slams the door.
   
   As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into
   his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.
   
                       ORDELL
             You better freeze, motherfucker!
   
   Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.
   
                       MAX
             You want your money? Your bond
             refund?
   
   He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills
   wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who
   catches it with his free hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's all?
   
                       MAX
             I have a bond receipt for you to
             sign.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
             about. You talk to her?
   
                       MAX
             She wants to give you your money. If
             she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
             ramming the door right now.
   
                       ORDELL
             How'd you find me?
   
                       MAX
             Winston found you.
   
                       ORDELL
             How the fuck did he find me?
   
                       MAX
             That's what Winston does. He finds
             people who don't want to be found.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, bully for that nigga. You say
             she wants to give me the money, huh?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, give it to me then.
   
                       MAX
             She wants to give it to you herself
             and collect her ten percent. She also
             wants to explain why she had to hold
             on to it.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'd like to hear that too. Turn
             around and put your hands on your
             head.
   
   Max does this, Ordell pats him down.
   
                       MAX
             Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
             already tried to get Jackie to go in
             with her, split the half million
             amongst themselves. What she did was
             take quite a risk to see you get your
             money.
   
                       ORDELL
             Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
   
                       MAX
             All I did was walk out with it.
   
                       ORDELL
             And you did that to protect my
             interest?
   
                       MAX
             In a way, yes.
   
                       ORDELL
             My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
             dumbass. Go sit over there on the
             couch.
   
   Max does.
   
                       MAX
             This place stinks.
   
                       ORDELL
             You get used to it after a while. Now
             tell me where my money's at.
   
                       MAX
             My office.
   
                       ORDELL
             And where's Jackie?
   
                       MAX
             She's been there since Thursday
             night.
   
                       ORDELL
             She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
             home?
   
                       MAX
             She was afraid.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (laughs)
             That I gotta see.
   
                       MAX
             She still is. She doesn't want to get
             shot before she can tell you what
             happened.
   
                       ORDELL
             Have her bring the money here.
   
                       MAX
             It's in the safe. She can't get at
             it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Call her, tell her the combination.
   
                       MAX
             I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
             She won't leave there till you have
             your money and you're gone.
   
                       ORDELL
             You expect me to just walk in there?
   
                       MAX
             If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
             in custody right now. When you said
             you'd name her as an accessory she
             believed you. That scares her more
             than anything.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's why she's givin' up my money
             huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
             I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
             knew how to handle her. She was my
             blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
             fuckin' told Louis he could've just
             given her a punch in the mouth, he
             didn't need to shoot her. She's at
             your office.
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             By herself. That big mandingo nigga
             Winston ain't there, is he?
   
                       MAX
             She's all alone.
   
                       ORDELL
             I call your office, she better answer
             the phone.
   
                       MAX
             She will.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Jackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's
   desk.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.
   
   She hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again...
   
   
   INT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   A STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a
   beeper "beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a
   dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a TV
   screen: Tom Snyder is interviewing a guest on his show
   ... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter-
   filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a
   sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his reclining chair.
   The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard
   offscreen.
   
   
   EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.
   
                       ORDELL
             All the time I've known her, I never
             heard her sound scared like that.
             Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
             I'm driving, gimme the keys.
   
   Max hands him the keys. They climb in.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to
   her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.
   
   
   INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
   
   Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays
   the radio, he likes the song and turns it up.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off
   the lights. The office goes dark. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
   slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat,
   sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
   Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
   illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a
   drag. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   His face is ice, the music is LOUD.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;
   
                       MAX
             It's the next street.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know where it is.
   
                       MAX
             Turn left.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know where to turn.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the
   window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and
   sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned
   off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             My money's in that office, right?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             She starts givin' me some bullshit
             about it ain't there. It's somewhere
             else and we can go get it.
                   (he holds up his Beretta)
             I'm shootin' you in the head right
             then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
             her in the kneecap, find out where my
             godamn money is. I go walkin' in
             there and that nigga Winston or
             anybody else is in there, you're the
             first man shot, understand what I'm
             sayin'?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, is there anything you want to
             tell me before we get out of this
             car?
   
                       MAX
             No.
   
                       ORDELL
             You sure?
   
                       MAX
             Yes.
   
                       ORDELL
             You better be, motherfucker.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
   in his pants.
   
                       ORDELL
             Get ahead of me and open the door.
   
   Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
   opens the door.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Step inside easy.
   
   Max does.
   
   Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
   
   Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
             in the goddamn dark for?
   
   Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
   bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
   light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
   out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
   
   Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
   Then Jackie says;
   
                       JACKIE
             Mark...
                   (raising her voice)
             ... he's got a gun!
   
   Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
   Beretta in his pants...
   
   ... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
   times in the chest...
   
   ... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
   lands at Max's feet.
   
   Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
   of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
   
   Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
   Ordell's body.
   
   Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
   looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
   over to the body.
   
   Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
   holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
   out of the bathroom.
   
                       DARGUS
             He's dead.
   
   Dargus looks up at Max;
   
                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
             Does he have the marked bills on him?
   
   Max still shaken;
   
                       MAX
             In his inside coat pocket.
   
   Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
   the forty-thousand marked dollars.
   
   Max looks at Jackie.
   
   She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
   just light up another Davidoff.
   
   Dargus looks up at Max;
   
                       DARGUS
             Why were you with him?
   
                       MAX
             I went to give him his refund, so he
             wouldn't have to come here.
   
                       DARGUS
             How'd you know where he was?
   
                       MAX
             I found out.
   
                       DARGUS
             And you didn't tell the Police?
   
                       MAX
             I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
             wanted him.
   
   Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.
   
                       JACKIE
             Remember when Ray said you hoped
             you'd get him before he got me?
   
   Dargus looks up and nods his head.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Well, you did. Thank you.
   
   She takes a drag on her Davidoff.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
   morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.
   
   A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TEN DAYS LATER"
   
   Max hears someone go;
   
                       JACKIE (O.S.)
             Knock knock.
   
   Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the
   doorway. She smiles at him.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Hey.
   
   MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Mark... he's got a gun!
   
   Dargus shoots Ordell, Ordell drops.
   
   
   BACK TO OFFICE
   
   Max smiles back.
   
                       MAX
             Hey, you.
   
   Jackie walks toward him.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got your package. It was fun
             getting a half-a-million dollars in
             the mail.
   
                       MAX
             Less ten percent.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
             out, since there wasn't no note.
   
   She sits in the chair in front of his desk.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
   
                       MAX
             I hesitated taking that much.
   
                       JACKIE
             You worked for it - if you're sure that's all
             you want.
   
                       MAX
             I'm sure.
   
   Pause between them.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm leaving, I have my things in my
             car. Why don't you walk out with me?
             I want to show you something.
   
   Max hesitates.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.
   
   He smiles and gets up from the desk.
   
   As she stands, Jackie says;
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he
             pissed he missed all the excitement.
   
                       MAX
             What's he doing?
   
                       JACKIE
             He's on to a new thing. He's after a
             guy who owns a gun shop he says is
             "woefully and wantonly" selling
             assault rifles to minors. He says
             he's gonna take him down if it's the
             last thing he does.
   
                       MAX
             Did you tell him you were leaving?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told him I might.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
   convertible.
   
                       MAX
             That's Ordell's.
   
                       JACKIE
             They've confiscated all his other
             stuff. But this one's sorta left
             over. The registration's in the glove
             box, the keys were under the seat...
             What's a matter" haven't you ever
             borrowed someone's car?
   
                       MAX
             Not after they're dead.
   
   She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
   at him across the black Mercedes.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't use you, Max.
   
                       MAX
             I didn't say you did.
   
                       JACKIE
             I never lied to you.
   
                       MAX
             I know.
   
                       JACKIE
             We're partners.
   
                       MAX
             I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't
             blame anybody for anything I do.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you blame yourself for helping me?
   
   He shakes his head 'no.'
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             'd feel a whole lot better if you
             took some more money.
   
                       MAX
                   (smiling)
             You'll get over that.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Where're you going?
   
                       JACKIE
             Spain.
   
                       MAX
             Madrid or Barcelona?
   
                       JACKIE
             Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
   
   He shakes his head 'no.'
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I hear they don't eat dinner till
             midnight.
   
   Max doesn't say anything.
   
                       JACKIE
             Wanna go?
   
                       MAX
             Thanks, but you have a good time.
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure I can't twist your arm?
   
                       MAX
             Thank you for saying that, but no. My
             business.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were tired of your
             business?
   
                       MAX
             I'm just tired in general.
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you scared of me?
   
   Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.
   
                       MAX
             A little bit.
   
   Jackie smiles back.
   
                       JACKIE
             Come over here.
   
   Max does.
   
   They give each other a long, tender kiss.
   
   She breaks it.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I'll send you a postcard, partner.

   We hear the rhythm of funky seventies SOUL MUSIC.
   
   Then SHE steps into FRAME.
   
   She is JACKIE BROWN, a stewardess dressed in her CABO AIR
   uniform. (A little shuttle airline that flies from Los
   Angeles to Cabo San Lucas. Approximate flight time: forty
   five minutes)
   
   Jackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her
   through the airport. The CREDITS APEAR and DISAPPEAR in
   front of her.
   
   Jackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid
   forties, though she looks like she's in her mid-thirties.
   
   The people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps
   off.
   
   She breezes through Customs and we follow her with a
   STEDICAM as she strides through the airport... She gets
   to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment
   comes back out sans flight bag picks up the microphone.

   A chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all
   holding different automatic weapons, BLASTING away.

   Play over this image.
   
   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (to camera)
             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
             its makers as being tough as the
             toughest customer.
   
   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
   VOICE begins talking over the video.
   
                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)
             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
             spray gun outta South Miami.
   
   After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.
   
                       BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
             for two hundred and sell 'em for
             eight.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
   ROBBIE.
   
   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
   
   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
   
   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
   body language and his thought process.
   
   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
   correction facility, in the real world his timing is
   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
   but attempt to sing anyway.
   
   The third person watching the video is the person who
   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
   from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
   and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
   
   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
   paying no attention to the video.
   
                       ORDELL
             This TEC-9? They advertise it as
             being the most popular gun in
             American crime. Can you believe that
             shit? It actually says that on the
             little booklet that comes with it.
             "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
             like they're proud of that shit.
   
   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
   
   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Check out this body-builder chick...
             Now see what she got. That's a Styer
             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
             Listen.
   
   Ordell punches up the volume.
   
   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
   
   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
             Austria. My customers don't know shit
             about it, so there ain't no demand.
                   (to Melanie)
             Baby, I could use some more ice.
   
   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
   from him and moves to the kitchen.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             But put that bad boy in a flick,
             every motherfucker out there want
             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
             they don't want one, they want two,
             cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
             What they don't know, and that movie
             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
             and steer a customer towards a 9-
             millimeter. Damn near the same
             weapon, don't have half the jammin'
             problems. But some niggas out there,
             you can't tell them anything. They
             want a .45. The killer had a .45,
             they want a .45.
   
   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
   sits where she was.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Thanks, Baby.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who's your partner?
   
   Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
   "Movieline Inside" magazine.
   
                       ORDELL
             Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in
             Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to
             him, gets it to my customers. On all
             my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't
             have a pot to piss in or a window to
             throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,
             motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He
             got himself a yacht, with all kinds
             of high tech navigational shit on it.
                   (back to video)
             AK-47, the very best there is.
   
   GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
   camera and describes the AK-47.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             When you absolutely, positively,
             gotta kill every motherfucker in the
             room, accept no substitute. That
             there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
             fifty and double my money.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       ORDELL(CONT'D)
             Get that for me, will ya baby?
   
                       MELANIE
             You know it's for you.
   
   Ordell just stares at her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Girl, you better not make me go over
             there and put my feet to ya.
   
   Louis keeps staring at he screen.
   
   Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
   the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
   says:
   
                       MELANIE
             Hello.
   
   Puts the phone down and says;
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             It's for you.
   
   Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
   chair, reclining back all the way.
   
   Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the
   phone.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (into phone)
             Yeah.
                   (pause)
             Hey, Junebug, what's up
   
   Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,
   watching the video.
   
   Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
   her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;
   
                       MELANIE
                   (referring to the tape)
             It's boring, isn't it?
   
                       LOUIS
             I can sit through it once.
   
                       MELANIE
             He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
   
                       MELANIE
             He's just repeating shit he
             overheard. He ain't any more a gun
             expert than I am.
   
   Holding up her pipe.
   
                       MELANIE
             Want a hit?
   
                       LOUIS
             Sure.
   
   Louis takes a hit off the pipe.
   
                       MELANIE
             When did you get out of jail?
   
                       LOUIS
             Four days ago.
   
                       MELANIE
             Where at?
   
                       LOUIS
             Susanville.
   
                       MELANIE
             How long?
   
                       LOUIS
             Two months shy of four years.
   
                       MELANIE
             Four years?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MELANIE
             What for?
   
                       LOUIS
             Bank robbery.
   
                       MELANIE
             Really, I'm impressed.
   
   Louis takes a drink of whiskey.
   
                       MELANIE
             Four years that's a long fuckin time.
   
   Louis nods his head in agreement.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
   Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of
   Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
             See, what did I tell you? Man in New
             York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and
             Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want
             it? It's the gun that nigga on "New
             York Undercover" uses. Because of
             that nigga, I can sell it to this
             nigga for twelve-fifty.
   
                       LOUIS
             What's your cost?
   
                       ORDELL
             As low as two.
   
                       LOUIS
             Are you serious?
   
                       ORDELL
             That's what I been tellin' you. Start
             adding these motherfuckin' figures
             up, and you tell me this ain't a
             business to be in.
   
   The phone rings again.
   
   Ordell looks at Melanie.
   
   Melanie looks at Ordell.
   
   They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up
   and gets the phone.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I got me five M-60 machine guns.
             These came straight from the Gulf
             War. I sold me three of them so far,
             twenty grand a piece.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's good money.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna
             make me a million dollars out of
             this. I already got me a half-a-
             million sittin' in Mexico. When I do
             this last delivery, I'm gonna make me
             another half-million.
   
                       LOUIS
             Then what?
   
                       ORDELL
             I get out. Spend the rest of my life
             spending.
   
   Melanie sits back down in he chair.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Who is it?
   
                       MELANIE
             It's Beaumont.
   
   
   KITCHEN
   
   Ordell, drink in hand, picks up the receiver.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (into phone)
             Beaumont¢Ordell. What's the problem?
                   (pause)
             What the fuck you doin' in jail?
                   (pause)
             What the fuck you doin' that for?
                   (pause)
             Ain't you got better sense than to be
             drivin' drunk carrying a goddam
             pistol?
   
   He listens to Beaumont on the other line - it's obvious
   Beaumont's starting to freak out. Ordell changes his
   tone.
   
                   ORDELL (CONT'D)
             - Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.
             Number one, you need to chill out,
             nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit
             ain't as bad as you think it is.
                   (pause)
             Course you're scared. That's what
             these motherfuckers get paid for
             scarin' the shit outta ya. That's
             their job. And my job is to get you
             the fuck home so let me tell you what
             is gonna happen... May I speak?...
             Thank you... You gonna spend the
             night in jail; it's too late to get
             you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna
             take you into court. I'm gonna be
             there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm
             gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut
             you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll
             be back home, I promise.
                   (pause)
             So just calm your ass down, and I'll
             see you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
             You owe me a helluva lot more than
             one, nigga.
                   (laughs)
             See you.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
   California. The name of the business is spelled out on
   the window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red
   cherry.
   
   Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.
   
   Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Inside Cherry Bail Bonds, looking out through the picture
   window. We can read the name on the glass backwards.
   Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
   building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.
   
   An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
   can be heard.
   
   Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang
   back."
   
                       MALE VOICE (O.S.)
             ... the judge doesn't give a fuck
             about that. He's ready to habitualize
             you. Is that what you want - you
             wanna look at ten years?
   
   The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a
   regular-Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind
   his desk talking on the phone. His eyes raise as he sees
   Ordell approach him.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll
             get you out, I promise. But it means
             I gotta pick you up tonight.
   
   Ordell motion to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
   motions for Ordell to take a seat.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Reggie, there ain't no two ways about
             it. You're spending the night in
             jail, but I already told you I'll get
             you out tomorrow. Now where are you?
                   (pause)
             You're at your mother's house, aren't
             you?
   
   Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).
   
   He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
   around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
   grinning.
   
   Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
   small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
   non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
   rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Okay. Just stay put till I come for
             you.
                   (pause)
             Reggie, do yourself a really big
             favor and be there when I get there.
   
   He hangs up the phone.
   
   Ordell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and
   smoking.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             How can I help you?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (indicating the Viceroy)
             Where would you like me to put my
             ash?
   
   Max looks at him for a moment.
   
                       MAX
             Use that coffee cup on the desk.
   
   Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
   bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.
   
                       ORDELL
             And I need me a bond for ten
             thousand.
   
   Max throws a look past Ordell to Louis.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Oh, that's just my white friend,
             Louis. He's got nothing to do with my
             business. We just hangin together.
             We're on our way to a cocktail
             lounge.
   
   From across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's
   direction.
   
   Max looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (returning to the photo)
             Who's that big Mandingo nigga you
             gotcha arm around?
   
   Max looks at him a moment and says;
   
                       MAX
             That's Winston. He works here.
   
                       ORDELL
             He's a big one. You two tight?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             It was our idea to take the picture,
             wasn't it?
   
   Max looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says;
   
                       MAX
             So, you want a ten-thousand dollar
             bond. What've you got for collateral?
   
                       ORDELL
             Gonna have to put up cash.
   
                       MAX
             You have it with you?
   
   Ordell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty
   chair next to him.
   
                       ORDELL
             It's in my bag.
   
                       MAX
             You have cash. What do you need me
             for?
   
                       ORDELL
             C'mon, you know how they do. Black
             man comes in with ten thousand, they
             wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they
             gonna wanna know where I got it.
             Second, they gonna keep a big chunk
             of it - start talkin' that court cost
             shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go
             through you.
   
                       MAX
             Cost you a thousand for the bond.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know that.
   
   Louis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other
   room drinking coffee.
   
                       MAX
             Who's it for? A relative?
   
                       ORDELL
             Fella named Beaumont. They have him
             up at county. It started out drunk
             driving, but they wrote it up
             "possession of a concealed weapon."
             Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
   
                       MAX
             Ten thousand sounds high.
   
                       ORDELL
             They ran his name and got a hit. He's
             been in before. Besides, Beaumont's
             from Kentucky, and I think they're
             prejudiced against black men from the
             South out here.
   
                       MAX
             He takes off and I gotta go to
             Kentucky to bring him back, you pay
             the expenses.
   
                       ORDELL
             You think you could do that?
   
   Max taking papers out of the drawer...
   
                       MAX
             I've done it.
   
   ... picking up the pen...
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What's his full name?
   
                       ORDELL
             Beaumont. That's the only name I
             know.
   
   Max looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious
   question.
   
   Max picks up the phone.
   
                       MAX
                   (on phone)
             Records office.
   
   Max on hold, looks at Ordell.
   
   Ordell smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (back on the line)
             Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry
             Bail Bonds. Who's this?
                   (pause)
             Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to
             look up the booking card and rough
             arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
                   (pause)
             That's all I have. I believe it's a
             surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.
   
   Louis enters the area, standing over Ordell.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm going to wait in the car.
   
                       ORDELL
             Sure.
                   (to Max)
             We almost done, ain't we?
   
                       MAX
             Getting there.
   
                       ORDELL
             You go wait in the car. Wait a
             minute.
   
   Ordell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of
   keys on it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
   
                       LOUIS
             Which one is for the car?
   
   Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki
   comes back on the line.
   
   Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (holding a key)
             This one's for the ignition...
                   (holding a little black
                   box)
             ... but you gotta hit this thing to
             shut the alarm off and unlock the
             door.
   
                       LOUIS
             What do I do?
   
                       ORDELL
             You ain't got to do nothing. Just
             point at it and push the button.
             You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
             means the alarm's off and the doors
             are open.
   
                       LOUIS
             Okay.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now play the volume as loud as you
             want but don't touch my levels. I got
             them set just the way I want 'em.
   
   Louis nods and goes out.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's
   black Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The
   car goes BLEEP.
   
   He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs
   inside.
   
   
   INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
   
   Max hangs up the phone.
   
                       MAX
                   (to Ordell)
             Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       ORDELL
             Livingston, huh?
   
                       MAX
             On his prior, he served nine months,
             and he's working on four years'
             probation.
   
                       ORDELL
             You don't say.
   
                       MAX
             Do you know what he's on probation
             for?
   
                       ORDELL
             Haven't a clue.
   
                       MAX
             Possession of unregistered machine
             guns.
   
                       ORDELL
             Will they consider this a violation
             of his probation?
   
                       MAX
             They do consider this a violation of
             his probation. Your boy's looking at
             ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, he won't like that. Beaumont
             don't got a doin' time disposition.
   
                       MAX
             I need your name and address.
   
                       ORDELL
             Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-I-

             90222.
   
                       MAX
             House or apartment?
   
                       ORDELL
             House.
   
                       MAX
             Now I need you to count your money.
   
   Ordell hands him the Lakers bag. Max takes the money out
   putting it on the desk.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hope you don't mind me askin' where
             you keepin' my money till I get it
             back. In your drawer?
   
   Max begins counting it.
   
                       MAX
             Across the street a Great Western. It
             goes in a trust account. You'll need
             to fill out an Application for
             Appearance Bond, an Indemnity
             Agreement, a Contingent Promissory
             Note. That's the one, if Beaumont
             skips and I go after him, you pay the
             expenses.
   
                       ORDELL
             Beaumont ain't going nowhere.
                   (he takes a pen out of
                   his pocket)
             Where do I sign?
   
   Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front
   of Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell
   reads the first agreement then says;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (reading the form)
             Hey, Max.
   
                       MAX
                   (still counting money)
             Yes.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (still reading form)
             I was wondering. What if before the
             court date gets here, Beaumont gets
             hit by a bus or something and dies.
                   (he puts the form down
                   and looks at Max)
             I get my money back, don't I?
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A BLACK FINGER
   
   Pressing a BLACK BUTTON next to the name, "BEAUMONT
   LIVINGSTON".
   
   
   INT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   BEAUMONT LIVINGSTON, wearing no shirt, sweatpants, and
   smoking a fatty answers the intercom, which buzzes
   loudly. We can hear JAY LENO interviewing a CELEBRITY on
   TV OFFSCREEN.
   
                       BEAUMONT
                   (into the speaker)
             Who is it?
   
   
   EXT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
   Hollywood apartment.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
   speaker.
   
                       ORDELL
             It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
             up.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Beaumont's finger pressing the entry
   button.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - The doorknob on the security gate,
   BUZZING. Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.
   
   Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his
   fingers. He sees Ordell approach.
   
   Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a
   big smile across his face.
   
                       ORDELL
             Look at you and your free ass. Come
             over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.
   
   Ordell and Beaumont embrace.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
             man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
             you... thank you... thank you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who was there for your ass?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             You were there for me.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             You.

   Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
   hard.
   
                       ORDELL
             You goddam right!
   
   Beaumont laughs.
   
                       ORDELL
             You see,ïit works like this. You get
             your ass in trouble, I get your ass
             out. That's my job. And I don't mind
             tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
             Ordell. They talkin' like they
             serious 'bout me doin' that machine
             gun time.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
             fright in your ass.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             If that's what they want to do,
             they're doin' it.
   
                       ORDELL
             How old is that machine gun shit?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Three years.
   
                       ORDELL
             Three years. That crime's old, man.
             They ain't got room in prison for all
             the motherfuckers out there killin'
             people. How they gonna find room for
             you?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             That's not what they're tellin' me.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's why they call it "fuckin' with
             ya." Now you wanna hear how we
             retaliate?
   
   Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
             Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let
             me tell you a little bit about my
             lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and
             this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my
             own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,
             he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And
             like Johnie Cochran, dude hates
             fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man
             lives to fuck with the police. So as
             a favor, I had him look at your case.
             Stacin told me you aint got shit to
             worry about. They just fuckin' wit
             ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on
             their ass, make 'em -
             (he bumps fist with Beaumont)
             ... Stop fuckin' wit ya!
   
   Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you
             know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was
             kinda hopin you could come with me.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What'd ya mean?
   
                       ORDELL
             Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
             does a nigga a favor - then BAM -
             hits a nigga up for a favor in
             return. But I'm afraid I gotta be
             that kinda nigga.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             I need a favor.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             That requires me goin out tonight?
   
                       ORDELL
             A bit.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
             goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,
             man. I'm home, I'm high -
   

                       ORDELL
             Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
             spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
             your ass home.
                   (changes tone)
             Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
             and you can help me.
   
   This has the desired effect.
   
                                               TIME CUT:
   
   
   WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
   
   Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
   Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
   with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
   STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What's the problem?
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
             situation. Remember I sold those
             three M-60 machine guns outta the
             five I got?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
             This group of Koreans in Koreatown
             have started a Neighborhood Watch
             kinda thing. And they want a few
             weapons so the neighborhood niggas
             know they mean business. So I'm gonna
             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
             Only problem, I aint never dealt with
             these Koreans before. Now I aint
             worried. Asians are by and large real
             dependable. They don't want no
             trouble. You might argue about price,
             but you aint gotta worry about them
             shootin' you in the back. But I got
             me kind of a rule. Never do business
             with nobody you ain't never done
             business with before without backup.
             That's why I need you, backup.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
             nowhere -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Let me finish. Can I finish?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Go ahead.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   TRUNK
   
   The trunk of a car is opened.
   
   Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
   action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
   of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
   a playing piece.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now you're gonn be in the trunk
             holding onto the shotgun. And I'm
             going to tell them I'm opening up my
             trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up
             the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
             boy.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
             anybody.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck I tell you. You don't
             hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
             gun. They'll get the idea.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
             be in there - ten minutes.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
             no minutes. Why don't I just ride
             with you?
   
                       ORDELL
             You can't ride with me. The surprise
             effect is ninety percent of it.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
             gittin' in that trunk.
   
                       ORDELL
             I can't believe you do me this way.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I ain't doin' you no way. I just
             ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
             problem with small places.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, my ass has got a problem
             spending ten thousand dollars of my
             own goddam money to get ungrateful,
             peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
             do it -
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Look, man, I know I owe you -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Well, if you owe me, git your ass
             in the trunk.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
             be locked in the trunk of no car.
   
                       ORDELL
             You think I wanted to spend ten
             thousand dollars on your ass?
   
   Beaumont starts to speak -
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Answer the question, nigga. Do you
             think I wanted to spend the thousand
             dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Course you didn't.
   
                       ORDELL
             But the only way to help you was to
             do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
             how 'bout this? After we're through
             fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
             you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
             My treat.
   
   Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
             smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
             side of red beans and rice.
             Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
   
   Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Now exactly how long I gotta be in
             this motherfucker.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   TRUNK
   
   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
   is SLAMMED closed.
   
   
   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
   
   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
   inside the dash.
   
   The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
   
   Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.
   
   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
   mouthing the words.
   
   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
   
   ... then stops.
   
   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
   goes black.
   
   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
   
   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
   the glovebox.
   
   The cab goes black.
   
   
   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
   
   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
   nowhere.
   
   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
   trunk and says;
   
                       ORDELL
             Don't worry. It's just me.
   
   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
   shotgun.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I was wondering. Did any federal
             people come visit you in jail and I
             should be watching my ass?
   
   Beaumont doesn't say anything.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You wouldn't tell me if they did and
             I wouldn't blame you.
   
   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
   
   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
   
   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
   
   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B
   song come back on, but VERY LOW.
   
   Ordell drives the Olds away.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping
   from one channel to another with a remote control,
   drinking cocktails from a can.
   
   The phone rings. He answers it.
   
                       LOUIS
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) - NIGHT
   
   Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the
   Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular
   phone next to his ear.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
   
                       ORDELL
             Whatcha watchin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back
             and forth. They had some black girl
             from some black show on Jay Leno. I
             watched that for a bit, but I kept
             flippin channels cause I didn't know
             who she was.
   
                       ORDELL
             Guess where I am?
   
                       LOUIS
             I dunno.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know you don't know. I said guess.
   
                       LOUIS
             The moon - I dunno
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
             cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
             outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
   
                       LOUIS
             You're outside?
   
                       ORDELL
             Uh-huh.
   
                       LOUIS
             C'mon in.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
             comfortable. I ain't about to walk
             into that roach motel and get
             uncomfortable. You bring your ass out
             here.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm in my underwear.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then put your goddam drawers on, and
             get your ass out here. I got
             somethin' to show you.
   
   
   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
   his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
   in front of the motel.
   
   As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
   comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
   in his seat looking up at Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know what your problem is, Louis?
   
   Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
   pockets.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You think you're a good guy. When you
             go into a deal you don't go in
             prepared to take that motherfucker
             all the way. You go in looking for a
             way out. And it ain't cause you're
             scared neither. It's cause you think
             you're a good guy, and you think
             there's certain things a good guy
             won't do. That's where we're
             different, me and you. Cause me, once
             I decide I want something, aint a
             goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
             me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
             get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
             Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
             removed. Understand what I'm saying?
   
   
   CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK
   
   Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
   his head blown off.
   
   Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
   back to Beaumont.
   
   Ordell closes the trunk.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who was that?
   
                       ORDELL
             That was Beaumont.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who was Beaumont?
   
                       ORDELL
             An employee I had to let go.
   
                       LOUIS
             What did he do?
   
                       ORDELL
             He put himself in a situation where
             he was gonna have to do ten years in
             the penetentiary, that's what he did.
                   (taking out a Viceroy and
                   lighting it up)
             And if you know Beaumont, you know
             there aint no way in hell he can do
             no ten years. And if you know that,
             you know Beaumont's gonna go any
             goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
             from doin' those ten years including
             telling the Federal government
             everything they want to know about my
             ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear
             case of him or me. And you best
             believe it aint gonna be me. You know
             what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
             this with me, you gotta be prepared
             to go all the way. I got me so far
             over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
             in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
             Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one
             more delivery, I'm gonna have me over
             a million. You think I'm gonna let
             this little cheese eatin' nigga here
             fuck that up? Shit, you better think
             again. 'Fore I let this deal get
             fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in
             the head, and ten niggas look just
             like em.
                   (pause)
             Understand what I'm sayin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             So we on the same page then?
   
                       LOUIS
             I follow.
   
   Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine
   smile).
   
   Louis grins.
   
   They both bump fists.

   "JACKIE BROWN"
   
   The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be
   heard underneath this...
   
   
   INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
   
   A SUBTITLE reads:
   
   "LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"
   
   We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage
   at LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the
   opening credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as
   she walks down the row of cars.
   
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             Miss Brown.
   
   She turns towards the voice/camera.
   
   Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her,
   holding open his I.D. case.
   
                       DARGUS
             Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
             L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
             that bag?
   
                       JACKIE
             The usual things. I'm a flight
             attendant with Cabo Air.
   
   Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene.
   
                       NICOLET
             Can I be of some assistance?
   
   As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her
   purse, she says to Ray;
   
                       JACKIE
             I doubt it.
                   (to Dargus)
             Who's your friend?
   
                       DARGUS
             This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
             with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
             Would you mind if we looked in that
             bag?
   
   Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.
   
                       JACKIE
             Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
   
                       DARGUS
             You have the right to say "no." And I
             have the right to make you wait here
             with Ray while I go get a warrant.
             And if I don't want to go through all
             that trouble, I could just take you
             in on suspicion.
   
                       JACKIE
             Suspicion of what?
   
                       NICOLET
             All he wants to do is peek in your
             bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
             anything.
   
   Jackie shrugs and says;
   
                       JACKIE
             Go ahead.
   
   Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on
   his haunches, and starts feeling through her things.
   
   
   CLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG
   
   A soiled blouse, uniform skirt, - then a manila envelope,
   a fat one, nine-by-twelve.
   
   Jackie watches him straighten the clasp...
   
   
   ENVELOPE
   
   Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar
   bills secured with rubberbands.
   
   Nicolet whistles.
   
   Dargus looks up at her.
   
                       DARGUS
             I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
             thousand dollars here. What would you
             say Ray?
   
                       NICOLET
             That looks like fifty thousand
             dollars from here.
   
   
   JACKIE
   
   Not saying anything at the moment.
   
                       DARGUS
             This is your money?
   
                       JACKIE
             If I were to tell you "no it
             isn't..."
   
   Dargus smiles.
   
                       DARGUS
             You should know if you bring in
             anything over ten thousand you have
             to declare it. You forgot or what?
             You could get a two hundred and fifty
             thousand dollar fine, plus two years
             in prison. Now you want to talk to us
             about it, or you want to talk to
             Customs?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not saying another word.
   
                       NICOLET
             Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
             if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
             of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
             Something about that job makes them
             kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
             you want to talk with a bunch of
             suspicious, disagreeable people like
             them, or a couple good-hearted guys
             like Mark and myself.
   
   Nicolet smiles.
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Doesn't smile back.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives.
   Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP
   until noted.
   
   
   INT. DARGUS OFFICE - DAY
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Hey, this is my office. There's no
             smoking.
   
                       JACKIE
             Arrest me.
   
   Nicolet laughs O.S.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             We could, smart ass... or we could
             work out what's known as a
             Substantial Assistance Agreement.
             That is if you're willing to
             cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
             money and who you're giving it to.
   
   Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.)
             You got a good lawyer?
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Can she afford a good one is the
             question. Otherwise she'll be in
             Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
             the Public Defender gets around to
             her.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.)
             Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
             Livingston?
   
   Not a word.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
             'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
             did know you, Beaumont was found in
             the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
             twice. Once in the head and once in
             the chest.
   
   Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
             yesterday. You see, like you,
             Beaumont found himself in some hot
             water. He was looking at ten years he
             was pretty sure he didn't want to do
             and was understandably concerned. Now
             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
   
   Not a word.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             If you don't want to talk to us, I
             guess we'll just have to hand you
             over to Customs.
   
   Jackie puts out her cigarette.
   
                       JACKIE
             Okay, let's go.
   
   She stares down the cops.
   
   
   DARGUS AND NICOLET
   
   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
   first time in the scene.
   
                       DARGUS
             You know, Miss Brown, there's
             basically three types of people that
             we come along in the performance of
             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
             Victims, witnesses, innocent
             bystanders... You ain't any of these.
             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
             sonabitches have dedicated their
             lives to a life outside the law. That
             ain't you either. Where you belong is
             the third category. The category we
             refer to as LOSERS.
   
   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
   says without expression;
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not a loser.
   
                       DARGUS
             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
             flying for TWA and got busted for
             carrying drugs. You were carrying
             them for a pilot husband of yours. He
             did time and you got off. But that
             ended your career with the big
             airlines. Cut to thirteen years
             later. You're forty-four years of
             age. You're flying for the shittiest
             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
             Mexican airline that there is. Where
             you make a whopping twelve-thousand
             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
             lot to show for a twenty year career.
             And to top it off, you're going to
             jail. Now true, the judge, even with
             your prior, will probably only give
             you a year or two. But this doesn't
             seem like the time of life you got
             years to throw away.
                   (pause)
             Now, we don't like trying losers like
             they're criminals. But in the absence
             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
             wasn't this money given to you by an
             American living in Mexico by the name
             of Cedric Walker?
   
   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
   
   Nicolet joins back in.
   
                       NICOLET
             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
             the hell it was he worked for out
             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
             the same person you were supposed to
             deliver this money to?
   
   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
   
   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
   it.
   
                       DARGUS
             I'd like your permission to open this
             again. So we'll know exactly how much
             money we're talkin' about here.
   
   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
   it on the desk.
   
                       JACKIE
             Help yourself.
   
                       DARGUS
             While you're at it, let me see what
             else is in there. You mind?
   
   She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.
   
                       JACKIE
             My pocketbook.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's in it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Beauty products.
   
   Nicolet takes the manila envelope.
   
                       NICOLET
             I'll count the money.
   
   Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
   packets in it.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's this?
   
                       JACKIE
             That's my diet shit.
   
   Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.
   
                       DARGUS
             Let's see what else is in there.
   
   Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
   His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, Miss Brown?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah?
   
   Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
   half-inch or so of white powder inside.
   
                       NICOLET
             And what would this be, Sweet and
             Low?
   
                       JACKIE
             What the fuck is that shit?
   
                       NICOLET
             I know what it looks like.
   
                       JACKIE
             You planted that shit on me.
   
   Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, that shit ain't mine.
   
                       NICOLET
                   (to Dargus)
             It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
             how 'bout Posession with the Intent
             to Distribute?
   
                       DARGUS
             Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
             all the cash, I think I could go with
             Conspiracy to Traffic.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
             about that fuckin' shit.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
             have a seat and tell us who might
             know something about this fuckin'
             shit.
   
   Jackie just looks at the two grinning Cheshire cats as
   the balance of power rolls over on her.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. TORRANCE MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
   
   A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the
   Torrance Court House.
   
   
   INT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
   
   Jackie, now wearing County Jail blues, sits next to
   another BLACK WOMAN. Their hands cuffed together.
   
   The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF
   unlocks the gate that encloses the prisoners. Then
   explains in a you-better-do-exactly-what-I-say manner,
   how they're going to leave the bus.
   
   
   EXT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
   
   MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues
   and handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.
   
   The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the
   court house.
   
   
   INT. HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - DAY
   
   Dargus and Nicolet confer with the PUBLIC DEFENDER, an
   attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit.
   
                       DARGUS
             If she'll cooperate with us, we'll
             turn possession with intent into
             plain ol' Possession, and she can
             bond outta here for one thousand
             bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll
             go for the Intent and request a
             twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.
   
   
   INT. COURTROOM - DAY
   
   Jackie and the Public Defender. Jackie, in her county
   blues; Public Defender in her nice suit.
   
                       JACKIE
             You tell those guys they'll have to
             do one helluva lot better than that
             before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             Well, that's the State's offer. If
             you plead to possession and tell
             L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your
             bond will be set at one-thousand
             dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will
             request one at twenty- five thousand
             based on your prior record and risk
             of flight. If you don't post it or
             don't know anyone who can, you'll
             spend six to eight weeks in County
             before your arraignment comes up.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who's side are you on?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             I beg your pardon?
   
                       JACKIE
             What if I plead guilty?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             And cooperate? You might get
             probation.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I don't cooperate?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             With the prior? You could get
             anywhere from a year to five
             depending on the judge. You want to
             think about it? You got two minutes
             before we're up.
   
   
   COURT IN SESSION
   
   It's a full schedule in court today. Jackie sits with a
   bunch of other females wearing county blues in the
   defendant's area (where the jury sits during a jury
   trial)
   
   Dargus and Nicolet sit in the courtroom.
   
   The JUDGE reads the next case.
   
                       JUDGE
             Brown. Case number 700324.
   
   Jackie rises amongst the other defendants.
   
   The P.D. rises.
   
   Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.
   
                       JUDGE
             The charge is possession of Narcotics
             with the Intent to Distribute. How
             does your client plead?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             She wishes to stand mute, your honor.
   
                       JUDGE
             Very well...
                   (to Dargus)
             ... Detective Dargus - You're the
             arresting officer in his case,
             correct?
   
                       DARGUS
             That's correct, your honor.
   
                       JUDGE
             You have a recommendation for bail?
   
                       DARGUS
             Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
             defendant's prior conviction and the
             extreme possibility of flight due to
             her occupation, the State requests a
             bond of no less than twenty-five
             thousand.
   
   The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...
   
                       JUDGE
             I'll set bond at ten thousand and set
             the date of August 14th for the
             arraignment.
   
                       JACKIE
             When is that, your honor?
   
                       JUDGE
             That's six weeks from now, Miss
             Brown. We'll continue this matter
             then. Owens, case 72242.
   
   Jackie sits down.
   
   Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle
   together.
   
   Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking
   pisses her off.
   
   
   DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
   
   We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a
   perspective from the back of the courtroom.
   
   We see Jackie in the defendant's area.
   
   We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way
   out of the courtroom.
   
   
   ORDELL
   
   Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any
   expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out
   of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.

   INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
   
   The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush
   behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges,
   zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.
   
   He looks up and stops dead.
   
   Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of
   Max's desk.
   
                       ORDELL
             Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you
             wash your hands.
   
   Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his
   desk.
   
                       MAX
             Comfortable?
   
                       ORDELL
             The door was opened, so I just came
             right in.
   
                       MAX
             I can see that. Why?
   
                       ORDELL
             I got some more business for ya.
   
                       MAX
             Oh, yeah? What did he do?
   
                       ORDELL (O.S.)
             She is an airline stewardess. Got
             caught coming back from Mexico with
             some blow. They set her bond this
             afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
             I was thinkin', you could use the ten
             thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
             move it over on to the stewardess.
   
                       MAX
             The bond for possession is only a
             thousand.
   
                       ORDELL
             They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
             it Possession with Intent. A black
             woman in her forties gets busted with
             less than two ounces on her, they
             call that shit Intent. Same shit
             happened to a movie star. It's
             Possession.
   
                       MAX
             It still sounds high.
   
                       ORDELL
             She had, I believe it was... fifty
             grand on her, too. There was a cop at
             the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
             wanted her bond set at twenty-five
             thousand, saying there was a risk of
             flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
             all.
   
                       MAX
             Before we start talking about
             stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of
             the way first.
   
   Sitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not
   quite.
   
                       ORDELL
             Somebody already did.
   
                       MAX
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             You didn't hear?
   
                       MAX
             Hear what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Somebody with a grudge blew
             Beaumont's brains out - hey, that
             rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.
   
                       MAX
             Did the police contact you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Very first motherfuckin' thing they
             did. They see I put up a big money
             bond on my boy, they start thinking
             with that where-there's-smoke-there's
             fire logic. They roust my ass outta
             bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
             Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
             to death. She thought they were gonna
             take my ass away for sure.
   
                       MAX
             The stewardess. Do you know her last
             name?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (smiles)
             Brown, Jackie Brown.
   
                       MAX
             What does she do for you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Who says she does anything for me?
             She's my friend. When my friends get
             into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
   
                       MAX
             Beaumont worked for you.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's what the police thought. I
             told them I'm unemployed, how could I
             have anybody work for me? Now I bail
             out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
             police on me again, huh? Wanting to
             know was she doing things for me, was
             she bringing me that money!
   
                       MAX
             Was she?
   
                       ORDELL
             Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
             client relationship? The lawyer can't
             tell nothing he hears?
   
                       MAX
             You're not my client until you get
             busted and I bond you out.
   
                       ORDELL
             If there's no - what do you call it -
             confidentiality between us? Why would
             I tell you anything?
   
                       MAX
             Cause you want me to know what a
             slick guy you are. You got
             stewardesses bringing you fifty
             grand.
   
                       ORDELL
             Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
             grand?
   
                       MAX
             You want me to speculate on what you
             do. I'd say you're in the drug
             business, except the money's moving
             in the wrong direction. Whatever
             you're into, you seem to be getting
             away with it, so more power to you.
             Okay you want another bond, and you
             want to move over the ten thousand
             you put down on Beaumont to the
             stewardess. That means paperwork. I
             have to get a death certificate,
             present it to the court, fill out a
             receipt for return of bond
             collateral, then type up another
             application. An indemnity agreement -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Jackie aint got time for all that
             shit -
   
                       MAX
             - I'm telling you what I have to do.
             What you have to do, in case you
             forgot, is come up with premium of a
             thousand bucks.
   
                       ORDELL
             I got it. I just don't got it on me.
   
                       MAX
             Well, come back when you do, and I'll
             bond out the stewardess.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, you know I'm good for it.
             Thousand bucks ain't shit.
   
                       MAX
             If I don't see it in front of me,
             you're right. It ain't shit.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, you need to look at this with a
             little compassion. Jackie ain't no
             criminal. She ain't used to this
             kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
             don't give a fuck - but for the
             average citizen, coupla nights in
             County fuck with your mind.
   
                       MAX
             Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
             don't have a tab.
   
                       ORDELL
             Just listen for a second. We got a
             forty-year-old, gainfully employed
             black woman, falsely accused -
   
                       MAX
             Falsely accused? She didn't come back
             from Mexico with cocaine on her?
   
                       ORDELL
             Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
             that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
             - it was just her shit to get high
             with.
   
                       MAX
             Is white guilt supposed to make me
             forget I'm running a business?
   
   Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.
   
                       ORDELL
             Okay, man. I got your money. But
             don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
             favor.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
   
   It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is
   driving to the County Jail with a client, a young
   Hispanic woman of twenty named ANITA.
   
                       MAX
             Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation
             officer. Karen's a good kid, but
             she's mad at you, because you lied to
             her. This business about your
             grandmother's funeral
   
                       ANITA
             I went. I did. I took my mother and
             little brother.
   
                       MAX
             But you didn't ask permission. You
             broke a trust. If you had asked,
             Karen probably would have let you.
             I'm sure she would.
   
                       ANITA
             I know. That's why I went.
   
                       MAX
             But then you told her you were home.
   
                       ANITA
             Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I
             could go.
   
   Max gives up.
   
                       MAX
             I don't know. Maybe it's a language
             problem.
                   (getting stern)
             Anita, you ever cause this much
             heartache over something that could
             easily be avoided, I'll never write
             you again. You understand?
   
                       ANITA
             I understand.
   
                       MAX
             I mean it. I don't care how many
             times your mother calls or how much
             she cries.
   
   Like an exasperated teenager.
   
                       ANITA
             I understand.
   
                       MAX
             Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
   
                       ANITA
             Yes, Max, I understand.
   
   
   INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT
   
   POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE
   
   Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed
   behind her back.
   
                       MAX
             Dropping off and picking up. Dropping
             of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
             Jackie.
   
   We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max
   undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take
   her away.
   
                       ANITA
             So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
   
                       MAX
             I'll call her.
   
                       ANITA
             Won't forget?
   
                       MAX
             I won't forget.
   
   She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her
   away.
   
                       ANITA
             Thanks, Max. See you later.
   
   Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len
   Deighton paperback and begins to read.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK

   MAX
   
   Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S
   voice.
   
                       SHERIFF (O.S.)
             Max! Here she comes.
   
   Max puts his book down and see -
   
   Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS.
   She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small
   envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When
   Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone
   with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this
   Jackie Brown's a knockout.
   
   As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail
   slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes.
   
   He approaches, handing her his card.
   
                       MAX
             Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm
             your bail bondsman.
   
   She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             I can give you a lift home if you'd
             like?
   
                       JACKIE
             Okay.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT
   
   Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you really a bail bondsman?
   
                       MAX
             Who do you think I am?
   
   She doesn't answer.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             I gave you my card there.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can I see your I.D.?
   
                       MAX
             You're serious?
   
   She waits.
   
   Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her,
   then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her
   to see.
   
   
   MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF
   CALIFORNIA
   
                       JACKIE
             Who put up my bond? Ordell?
   
                       MAX
             In cash.
   
   She looks straight ahead.
   
   Max shifts into drive.
   
   Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY
   comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window
   Max's .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy
   his pass in exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then
   puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He
   drives on.
   
   
   MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)
   
                       JACKIE
             Can we stop for cigarettes?
   
                       MAX
             Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't think so.
   
                       MAX
             It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
   
                       JACKIE
             Couldn't we just stop at a seven-
             eleven?
   
                       MAX
             I thought you might want a drink?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'd love one, but not there.
   
                       MAX
             We could stop at the Hilton by the
             airport.
   
                       JACKIE
             Is it dark?
   
                       MAX
             It's kind of a sports bar
   
                       JACKIE
             That doesn't sound dark.
   
                       MAX
             Why does it need to be dark?
   
                       JACKIE
             'Cause I look like I just got outta
             jail, that's why. You droppin' me off
             at home, right? There's a place by
             me.
   
                       MAX
             Great.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
   
   A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick
   inn.
   
   
   INT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
   
   CLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out.
   
   Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
   the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
   join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
   return.
   
   The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
   dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
   Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
   lives (about ten minutes from LAX)
   
   The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
   and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
   years before it became a black bar.
   
   A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B.
   
   Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
   a bar candle in a red glass thing.
   
   Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
   white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
   Max.
   
                       MAX
             No thanks, I quit three years ago.
   
   As she lights her cigarette.
   
                       JACKIE
             You gain weight?
   
                       MAX
             Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back
             on.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why I don't quit. If I can't
             fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch
             of a time gettin' my brand.
   
                       MAX
             What's your brand?
   
                       JACKIE
             Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
             They're hard to find here. I was
             locked up with the last two getting
             legal advice from a woman who was in
             for bustin' her boyfriend's head open
             with a baseball bat.
   
                       MAX
             Was she helpful?
   
                       JACKIE
             She was more helpful than the fuckin'
             Public Defender.
                   (she takes a sip of wine)
             I don't know - I guess what I need is
             a lawyer, find out what my options
             are.
   
                       MAX
             You know, I figured out the other day
             I've written something like' fifteen
             thousand bonds since I've been in the
             business. I'd say about eighty
             percent of them were at least drug
             related. If you want, I can help you
             look at your options.
   
   Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.
   
                       JACKIE
             You're not tired of it?
   
                       MAX
                   (smiles)
             I am, as a matter of fact.
   
   A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What have they told you?
   
                       JACKIE
             So far I've been told I can cooperate
             and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
             stand mute and get as much as five
             years. Does that sound right?
   
                       MAX
             I'd say if you're tried and found
             guilty you won't get more than a year
             and a day. That's State time. Prison.
   
                       JACKIE
                   (under her breath)
             Shit.
   
                       MAX
             But they won't want to take you to
             trial. They'll offer you simple
             Possession, a few months of County
             time, and a year or two probation.
                   (pointing to her drink)
             How 'bout another?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
   Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
   ROWEN for two more.
   
                       MAX
             You know who put the dope in your
             bag?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, but that's not what this was
             about. They were fuckin waitin' for
             my ass. They knew I had that money,
             they even knew the amount. The one
             who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
             Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
             "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
             here. What would you say?" But all
             they could do was threaten me and
             hand me over to Customs, and I could
             tell they didn't want to do that.
   
                       MAX
             They wanted you to tell them what you
             know.
   
                       JACKIE
             I had 'em too. I burnt those two
             Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
             Then their asses lucked out and found
             that coke.
   
                       MAX
             What did they want to know?
   
                       JACKIE
             Who gave me the money and who I was
             giving it to. And some guy they found
             in a trunk with his head blown off.
             Said it was him who told them 'bout
             me.
   
   The Waitress comes with the drinks.
   
                       ROWEN
             Can I get you two some popcorn?
   
                       MAX
             No, thanks.
   
   Rowen exits.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             That would be Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's him. How do you know 'em?
   
                       MAX
             I wrote him on Monday. They found him
             dead on Tuesday.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell pick up his bond?
   
                       MAX
             Same as you. Ten thousand.
   
                       JACKIE
             The federal agent kinda half hinted
             Ordell might of done Beaumont.
   
                       MAX
             You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
             but you didn't mention the Federal.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't?
   
                       MAX
             No, you didn't. What branch?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,
             and Firearms.
   
   Max puts it together.
   
                       MAX
             He's the one who wants you.
   
                       JACKIE
             It was the other guy who busted me.
   
                       MAX
             'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
             hell bonding out of federal court. He
             doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
             you to tell him what you know. He
             uses you to get a line on Ordell,
             make a case, then take him federal.
             You know what Ordell's into?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
             aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
             smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
             leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
             be interested in.
   
   Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
   her mind and makes a decision.
   
                       JACKIE
             I used to bring over ten thousand at
             a time. That's the legal limit, so I
             never brought more than that.
   
                       MAX
             How many trips did you make?
   
                       JACKIE
             With ten thousand? Nine.
   
                       MAX
             He's got that kinda money?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
             bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
             what do you call it when you got
             money, but don't have cash?
   
                       MAX
             Cash poor?
   
                       JACKIE
             That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
             me till I finally said okay. I'll
             bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
             twelve envelope. I got paid five
             hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
             Walker, in Mexico gave me the
             envelope.
   
                       MAX
             If you knew bringing anything over
             ten thousand was against the law, why
             not pack a hundred grand?
   
   Jackie gets exasperated.
   
                       JACKIE
             Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
             and not hit you in the face if the
             bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
             problem. I gotta figure out a way to
             either keep my job or get out of
             trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
             leave the country I'm out of a job.
             And if I don't got a job, I can't
             hire a lawyer.
   
                       MAX
             Ask A.T.F. They might give you
             permission.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, if I cooperate.
   
                       MAX
             Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
             gonna have to give 'em something.
   
                       JACKIE
             But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
             name - I don't really know shit about
             what he does or how he does it - That
             don't give me much to bargain with.
   
                       MAX
             Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
             Show a willingness to be helpful. You
             want to stay out of jail, don't you?
   
   Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What'dya think?
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             I think maybe I have more options
             than I thought.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP: ORDELL
   
   Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street
   from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny
   Cash is playing inside his car.
   
   
   EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT
   
   ORDELL'S POV
   
   Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
   and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
   off.
   
   
   ORDELL
   
   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
   
   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
   moment, then Jackie opens the door.
   
                       ORDELL
             How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was expecting you. Come in.
   
   Jackie holds the door open for him.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
   the living room.
   
                       ORDELL
             You got some booze?
   
   Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
   frightened.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got some vodka in the freezer.
   
                       ORDELL
             Got some o.j.?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, then, why don't you be a good
             hostess and make me a screwdriver?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
   Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
   hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
   doesn't turn on the light.
   
                       ORDELL
             You gonna thank me?
   
   Taking a glass from the cupboard.
   
                       JACKIE
             For what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Who you think got your ass outta
             jail?
   
   Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes
   and taking out vodka.
   
                       JACKIE
             The same guy who put me in, thanks a
             lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
             our business.
   
   Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
   takes out orange juice, then closes the door.
   
                       JACKIE
             It wasn't mine.
   
   Ordell has to stop and think.
   
   Jackie makes screwdriver.
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
             Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
             Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
             there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
             shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
             apologize. I 'magine they asked you a
             shitload of questions about it, huh?
             All that money, want to know where
             you got it?
   
   Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
   handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'magine they asked who you givin' it
             to, too.
   
                       JACKIE
             They asked.
   
                       ORDELL
             And what was your answer?
   
                       JACKIE
             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
   
                       ORDELL
             You positive about that? You weren't
             nervous and let something slip by
             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
             just gotta know.
   
   Jackie says to his face;
   
                       JACKIE
             You're not asking the right
             questions.
   
   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.
   
                       JACKIE
             Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       ORDELL
             I knew it.
   
                       JACKIE
             And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
   
   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah?
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't tell 'em anything.
   
   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL
             My name come up?
   
   Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
   
   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
   gloved hands on her shoulders.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You say anything about me?
   
   Jackie shakes her head "no."
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
   
   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
   his, but still shows no fear.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             This fella Beaumont, they say what
             happened to him?
   
                       JACKIE
             They told me.
   
   At this moment the film becomes a:
   
   
   SPLIT SCREEN
   
   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
   driving home in his Seville.
   
   
   MAX IN CAR
   
   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
   "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
   COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
   
   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
   Torrance.
   
   
   ORDELL AND JACKIE
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
             what he might say to keep from doin
             some time. I'magine from time-to-time
             they asked you a whole shitload of
             questions. And you didn't give 'em no
             answer?
   
   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
   
   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
   of her throat.
   
                       ORDELL
             You scared of me?
   
   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
   leaving his. Reaches over the seat
   
                       ORDELL
             You got a reason to be nervous with
             me?
   
   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
   
   Ordell hears a CLICK.
   
   Can't believe it.
   
   
   MAX IN CAR
   
   Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...
   
   
   THE GLOVE BOX
   
   The gun is gone.
   
                       MAX
             Where is it?
   
   
   A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH
   
                       ORDELL
             Is that what I think it is?
   
                       JACKIE
             What do you think it is?
   
   
   CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH
   
                       ORDELL
             I think it's a gun pressing against
             my dick.
   
                       JACKIE
             You thought right... Now take your
             hands from around my throat, nigga.
   
   Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.
   
   END OF SPLIT SCREEN
   
   Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
   pushes him against the wall.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the hell you doin'?
   
                       JACKIE
             Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
   
   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
   pocket
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
             with you. I just carry that. You been
             listenin' to them cops too much.
   
                       JACKIE
             The cops didn't try and strangle my
             ass.
   
                       ORDELL
             Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
             you.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
             gonna unload both these
             motherfuckers, you don't do what I
             tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
   
                       ORDELL
             Baby, I ain't come here -
   
   She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
   
                       JACKIE
             I said, you understand what I'm
             saying
   
                       ORDELL
             I understand woman, damn!
   
                       JACKIE
             Go sit over in that chair.
   
   Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
   Ordell still tries bullshit...
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm tellin' you, those cops been
             fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
             black against black, that's how they
             do.
   
                       JACKIE
             Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
             down.
   
   Ordell sits.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Put both hands behind our head.
   
   Ordell does...
   
                       ORDELL
             This shits gettin silly now...
   
   Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.
   
                       JACKIE
             I gotta tell you to shut up one more
             time, I'm gonna shut you up.
   
   Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
   hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
   
   A coffee table lays between them.
   
   Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
   
                       ORDELL
             I just came here to talk.
   
                       JACKIE
             Way I see it, me and you only got one
             thing to talk about. What you willing
             to do for me?
   
   Ordell looks at her a moment and says;
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
   
   Jackie shakes her head "no!"
   
                       JACKIE
             Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
             later they're gonna get around to
             offering me a plea deal, and you know
             that. That's why you came here to
             kill me.
   
                       ORDELL
             - Baby, I didn't -
   
                       JACKIE
             - It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
             let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
             And if I don't, I go to jail.
   
   Ordell, very interested.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah?
   
                       JACKIE
             One hundred thousand put in an escrow
             account in my name, if I'm convicted
             up to a year, or put on probation. If
             I have to do more than a year, you
             pay another hundred thousand.
   
   Ordell just takes in what the woman said.
   
                       ORDELL
             I got a problem...
   
                       JACKIE
             All your money's in Mexico.
   
   Ordell has to smile at the woman.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah.
   
                       JACKIE
             I been thinkin about that, too, and I
             got me a idea.
   
                                               TIME CUT:
   
   
   DOORWAY
   
   Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
   into FRAME, and talks with him.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
             tell you if it's on.
   
                       ORDELL (O.S.)
             Talk to you tomorrow.
   
   Ordell leaves.
   
   Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   OVER BLACK
   
   We hear a knock-knock on the door.
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   SAME SHOT DORWAY
   
   Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
   visitor;
   
                       JACKIE
             You want your gun, don't you? Come
             in. I'll go get it.
   
   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
   
   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
   
   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
   of sad smile.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
             asked to borrow it you'd say no.
             You'd have to. Would you like some
             coffee?
   
   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
   completely, leaving only curiosity.
   
                       MAX
             If you're having some.
   
                       JACKIE
             I am. Have a seat.
   
   Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
   at the dining table off of the kitchen.
   
                       MAX
             You get a chance to use it?
   
                       JACKIE
             I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
             went bad when I was in jail.
   
                       MAX
             Black's fine.
   
   She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
   coffee in it.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You want to hang on to it awhile? It
             wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
   
   Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks, but I have my own now.
   
                       MAX
             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun?
   
   She turns off the water.
   
                       JACKIE
             What, I couldn't hear you?
   
                       MAX
             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun.
   
   Pouring water into the coffee machine.
   
                       JACKIE
             Let's just say I got one, okay?
   
   She turns on the coffeemaker.
   
                       MAX
             Somebody loan it to you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Jackie leaves the kitchen.
   
   Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Want to hear some music?
   
                       MAX
             Sure.
   
   Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
   leaned up against the wall on the floor.
   
                       JACKIE
             I couldn't wait till I got home last
             night and wash my hair.
   
                       MAX
             It looks nice.
   
   She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
   album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
   turntable.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You never got into the whole CD
             revolution?
   
                       JACKIE
             I got a few. But I can't afford to
             start all over again. I got too much
             time and money invested in my
             records.
   
   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
   from the early seventies.
   
                       MAX
             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
             records.
   
   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't buy new stuff that often.
   
   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
   cigarette and stands.
   
   Max listens to the soul song.
   
                       MAX
             This is pretty.
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MAX
             Who is this?
   
                       JACKIE
             The Delfonics.
   
                       MAX
             '76?
   
                       JACKIE
             '74, I think.
   
                       MAX
             It's nice.
   
   They listen for a moment.
   
                       JACKIE
             I called in sick this morning. As far
             as the airline knows, I'm still
             available.
   
                       MAX
             Are you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
             with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
             what you suggested. Offer to help and
             see what happens.
   
                       MAX
             What I meant was have a lawyer do the
             negotiating for you.
   
                       JACKIE
             I want to talk to them first. I know
             more now about Ordell's money.
   
                       MAX
             Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
             who wants you, that'll only interest
             him up to a point.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
             million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
             safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
   
                       MAX
             How'd you find that out?
   
                       JACKIE
             He told me last night.
   
                       MAX
             He called you?
   
                       JACKIE
             He came by.
   
                       MAX
             What?... What'd you do?
   
                       JACKIE
             We talked.
   
   Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
   but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             He had his doubts at first. But he's
             always trusted me an wants more than
             anything to believe he still can.
   
                       MAX
             Why?
   
                       JACKIE
             He needs me. Without me all that
             money is just gonna sit over there in
             Cabo. Sugar?
   
                       MAX
             No thanks. There's gotta be other
             ways to get it out.
   
   She pours the coffee.
   
                       JACKIE
             Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
             used. He can't trust his other
             people. They're crooks. He can try
             bringing I in himself, but Ordell
             sure don't want to go through no
             Customs line. Either he recruits
             another Cabo stewardess, or he
             continues to trust me. I made him
             feel he still can.
   
   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
   sits down.
   
                       MAX
             How do you get it out?
   
                       JACKIE
             Same way I been don', but first they
             got to let me go back to work.
   
                       MAX
             You're gonna offer to set him up?
   
                       JACKIE
             If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
             'em.
   
                       MAX
             It's very possible Ordell's killed
             somebody.
   
                       JACKIE
             I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
             doin' that probation thing again.
   
   Max watches her a moment
   
   Jackie takes a drink of coffee.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             How do you feel about getting old?
   
                       MAX
             You're not old. You look great.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm asking how you feel. Does it
             bother you?
   
                       MAX
             It's not really something I think
             about.
   
                       JACKIE
             Really?
   
                       MAX
             Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
             hair. It started falling out ten
             years ago. So I did something about
             it.
   
                       JACKIE
             How'd you feel about it?
   
                       MAX
             I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
             done it, I did it to feel better
             about myself, and I do. When I look
             in the mirror it looks like me.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's different with men.
   
                       MAX
             You know, I can't really feel too
             sorry for you in that department.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             In fact, I'd make a bet that except
             possibly for an Afro - you look
             exactly the same as you did at twenty
             nine.
   
   Jackie smiles into her coffee.
   
                       JACKIE
             My ass ain't the same.
   
                       MAX
             Bigger?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Max smiles.
   
                       MAX
             Nothin wrong with that.
   
   Jackie's smile grows bigger.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Does something else worry you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I just feel like I'm always starting
             over. You said how many bonds you
             wrote?
   
                       MAX
             Fifteen thousand.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I've flown seven million miles.
             And I've been waitin' on people
             almost twenty years. The best job I
             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
             which is about the worst job you can
             get in this industry. I make about
             sixteen thousand, with retirement
             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
             now with this arrest hanging over my
             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
             gotta start all over again, but I got
             nothin to start over with. I'll be
             stuck with whatever I can get. And
             that scares me more than Ordell.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
   
   A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the
   big building... ten heads for the office of Mark Dargus.
   
   He reaches the closed door... raps on it.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Come in.
   
   Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown
   sitting in the office talking.
   
                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
             Great, you're here.
   
                       NICOLET
             Hey, Jackie.
   
   Jackie waves.
   
   Dargus stands up and says to Jackie;
   
                       DARGUS
             Let me have a word outside with Agent
             Nicolet for a moment?
   
                       JACKIE
             Take your time.
   
                       DARGUS
             Thanks.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well just be a minute.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can I smoke?
   
                       DARGUS
             Go ahead.
   
   The two detectives step outside and close the door on
   Jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's going on?
   
                       DARGUS
             She wants to make a deal.
   
                       NICOLET
             She sound scared?
   
                       DARGUS
             She almost sounds scared.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's she want?
   
                       DARGUS
             She wants to go back to work.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's she willing to give us?
   
                       DARGUS
             She hasn't one into specifics yet,
             she's been waiting for you.
   
                       NICOLET
             She knows it's my case?
   
                       DARGUS
             She ain't said it, but she's not
             stupid, she knows it's you who wants
             her.
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.
   
   Dargus and Nicolet come back inside.
   
                       NICOLET
             Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell
             me, what can we do for you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I need permission to leave the
             country so I keep my job.
   
                       NICOLET
             We can look into that.
   
                       JACKIE
             I need it tomorrow. If I don't show
             up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
   
                       NICOLET
             You know what we want.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I'm working, I can help you.
   
                       DARGUS
             Help us do what?
   
                       JACKIE
             Help you get Ordell Robbie.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, so now you know him?
   
                       JACKIE
             You never asked me if I did or not.
   
                       DARGUS
             But now you're telling us now you do.
   
                       JACKIE
             'Course I do - I deliver money for
             him.
   
                       NICOLET
             No shit. You know how he makes hi
             money?
   
                       JACKIE
             He sells guns.
   
                       NICOLET
             You ever see him sell guns?
   
                       JACKIE
             No.
   
                       NICOLET
             Then how do you know he sells guns?
   
                       JACKIE
             He told me. Besides, why else would
             an A.T.F. man be after him?
   
                       NICOLET
             How can you help us?
   
                       JACKIE
             Short of wearing a wire, I'll do
             everything I can to help you throw
             his ass in jail. And in exchange for
             my help, I need permission to leave
             the country and immunity.
   
                       DARGUS
             You don't want much, do you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Can you do it or not?
   
   The two cops look at each other.
   
                       DARGUS
                   (to Nicolet)
             It's your call.
   
   Nicolet looks at Jackie.
   
                       NICOLE
             It's possible.

   "LOUIS GARA & MELANIE"
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   FADE UP ON ON TV
   
   Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
   proclaiming he's the "mad dog." The film is an Italian
   Policier from the seventies.
   
   Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
   hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up
   a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit.
   Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts
   and a loose top.
   
   The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through
   it carrying shopping bags.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're back.
   
                       MELANIE
             'Ola!
   
   We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new
   "look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black
   jeans.
   
   Melanie notices the change.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got
             some new clothes.
   
                       ORDELL
             We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy
             running around lookin' like a bum on
             the street.
   
                       LOUIS
             I didn't look like a bum.
   
                       ORDELL
             But you did have a Salvation Army-
             thing going.
   
   Ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the
   air.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Goddam, girl. You gettin' high
             already. It's only two o'clock.
   
   Melanie smiles.
   
                       MELANIE
             It's that late?
   
   Louis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback.
   
                       ORDELL
             Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too
             much of that shit. That shit robs you
             of your ambition.
   
                       MELANIE
             Not if your ambition is to get high
             and watch TV.
   
   Melanie and Louis laugh.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       ORDELL
             You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,
             ain't ya.
                   (he moves towards the
                   phone - to Melanie)
             Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
   
   He picks it up.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hello.
                   (pause)
             Hey, Jackie...
                   (throwing a hard look at
                   Melanie)
   
   No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
   
                       MELANIE
             I was gonna tell you...
   
   Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
   
   Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
   all the while smiling like a shark.
   
   Louis smiles to himself.
   
   Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
   
   Ordell's on the phone.
   
                       ORDELL
             No, not on the phone, let's meet
             somewhere. But you gotta make sure
             they ain't followin' you...
   
   Louis has the bong in front of him.
   
   Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.
   
                       LOUIS
             Is it ready to go?
   
                       MELANIE
             Yeah, there's another hit left.
   
   Louis takes it.
   
   Ordell's on the phone.
   
   
   INT. COCKATOO INN
   
   Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
   both sides.
   
                       JACKIE
             The Cockatoo Inn.
   
                       ORDELL
             The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
             Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
             brick...
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, wait, you mean that place that
             has the big sign with a rooster on
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's a cockatoo.
   
   Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.
   
                       MELANIE
             You okay?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
             smoke or laugh now it seems without
             coughing.
   
                       MELANIE
             Coughing opens up the capillaries.
             When you cough, you're getting air -
             in this case smoke - to parts of the
             lung that don't normally get used.
             Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
             dad coughs when he smokes all the
             time.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to Louis)
             Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
             So since you like gettin' high so
             much, why don't you stay here with
             Melanie, get high, and watch
             cartoons?
   
   Louis with a smile.
   
                       LOUIS
             Way ahead of you.
   
   Melanie laughs.
   
   Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
   till he finds a channel with cartoons.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you just watch this for the next
             three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
             when I'm through with all my
             business, I'll get high. I get high
             at night. Walk me to the door, space
             girl.
   
   Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
   door,
   
   Ordell says to her in the doorway;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hope you don't mind keeping him
             company.
   
                       MELANIE
             No problem.
   
                       ORDELL
             Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
             they're new.
   
   Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
   look.
   
   Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
             hang with Mel.
   
   Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
   around and looks at Louis.
   
                       MELANIE
             Want a Metrix?
   
                       LOUIS
             What's a Metrix?
   
   She crosses to the kitchen.
   
                       MELANIE
             It's like this major meal in a shake
             you drink instead of having a big
             meal.
   
                       LOUIS
             It's a diet thing?
   
                       MELANIE
             No, it's what body builders drink to
             beef up.
   
                       LOUIS
             No thanks.
   
   She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
   shake.
   
   He looks around and spots something interesting.
   
   
   TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
   
   In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
   sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
   setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
   style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
   face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
   somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
   disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
   
   Louis picks up the photo frame.
   
                       LOUIS
             How old were you here?
   
   She looks and sees what he's talking about.
   
                       MELANIE
             Which one?
   
                       LOUIS
             The roller disco one.
   
                       MELANIE
             Fourteen.
   
   Louis walks over.
   
                       LOUIS
             You're fourteen years old here?
   
                       MELANIE
             Yeah.
   
                       LOUIS
             I thought you were sixteen.
   
                       MELANIE
             I was pretty much the same height now
             as I was then.
   
                       LOUIS
             Were you a disco girl?
   
                       MELANIE
             Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
             I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
             discos.
   
                       LOUIS
             So where did you go?
   
                       MELANIE
             The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
             a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
             girl. I hated disco.
   
   She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
   till she hits Stop!
   
   Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
   looks at the picture.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             That was taken at a place called
             "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were
             you in L.A. back then?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             Where were you?
   
                       LOUIS
             Detroit.
   
                       MELANIE
             With Ordell?
   
                       LOUIS
             We had done time together already.
   
   Melanie drinks her Metrix.
   
                       MELANIE
             Were you a disco guy?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             C'mon, don't lie.
   
                       LOUIS
             I don't like dancing.
   
                       MELANIE
             Did you ever go I one?
   
                       LOUIS
             I went to a few just to meet women.
             But I don't like to dance, and it's
             so fuckin; loud. During that whole
             scene I just drank in bars.
                   (he points to the cut
                   picture)
             Who didn't make the cut?
   
                       MELANIE
             That's a picture of me in Japan.
   
                       LOUIS
             You been to Japan?
   
                       MELANIE
             I lived there for about nine months.
   
                       LOUIS
             You lived in Japan, when?
   
                       MELANIE
             About five years ago.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who's arm is that?
   
                       MELANIE
             That's the guy I lived with... his
             name was... Hir.Hirosh.
   
                       LOUIS
             Must of made quite an impression.
   
                       MEALINE
             I never got to know him, really. I
             couldn't speak Japanese, and his
             English was terrible. But I couldn't
             say anything, because his English was
             better than my Japanese.
   
                       LOUIS
             That sounds like a problem.
   
                       MELANIE
             Not really. We didn't have much to
             say to each other anyway. I never got
             to know him that well, but I knew
             enough to know I wasn't missing much.
             I keep that, because of all the
             fuckin' time I was there, that's the
             only picture I got of me in Japan.
                   (she points beyond her
                   shoulder)
             That's Japan.
   
   Melanie looks up at Louis.
   
                       MELANIE
             Wanna fuck?
   
                       LOUIS
             Sure.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   OVER BLACK
   
   SUBTITLE:
   
   "THREE MINUTES LATER"
   
                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   LOUIS
   
   Lies on the couch on his back and Melanie sits on top of
   him. They're going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys.
   Almost on the fade up, Louis cums.
   
                       MELANIE
             That was fun.
   
   She hops off and OUT OF FRAME.
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, that really hit the spot.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Now that's over, let's get to know
             each other.
   
   
   INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
   
   CLOSEUP a rack of CDs all beginning with "D" are flipped
   through, till it stops on one CD, "The Best of the
   DELFONICS."
   
   Max is standing in he soul music section o a music store.
   He lifts out the CD and turns it over.
   
   It has the song Jackie played this morning.
   
   He smiles and takes the CD up to the register.
   
   CLOSEUP the COCKATOO INN neon sign, unlit during the day.
   
   
   INT. THE COCKATOO INN - DAY
   
   Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
   middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
   drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
   jukebox. He sits next to her.
   
                       ORDELL
             I gotta remember this place. This is
             all right. Two minutes from your
             crib, ten minutes from your work. Not
             bad...
   
   A black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell.
   
                       FLOYD
             What's your drink, brother?
   
                       ORDELL
             Screwdriver.
   
                       FLOYD
                   (to Jackie)
             How you doin'?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm fine.
   
                       FLOYD
             Yes, you are.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
   Floyd makes Ordell's drink.
   
                       ORDELL
             I bet you come here on a Saturday
             night, you need nigga repellent keep
             'em off your ass.
   
                       JACKIE
             I do okay.
   
                       ORDELL
             You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I
             bet you do a damn sight better than
             okay. You think anybody followed you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't think so, but it don't really
             matter. They know I'm meeting you.
   
                       ORDELL
             How the fuck they know that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them.
   
   Floyd comes back with Ordell's screwdriver.
   
                       FLOYD
             Three twenty-five.
   
   Ordell digs in his pocket and gives Floyd a five.
   
                       ORDELL
             Keep it.
   
                       FLOYD
             Thank you, sir.
   
   Floyd leaves.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to Jackie)
             You told em? You told em it's me?
   
                       JACKIE
             They already know it's you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta
             confirm it!
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, the only way I can get
             permission to fly is if I agree to
             help them. Which is what I have to
             appear to be doing. So I give them
             something they already know. You.
   
                       ORDELL
             Didja tell 'em anything else?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them you got a half a million
             dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
             bring it here.
   
   Ordell freaks.
   
                       ORDELL
             You told them that?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's true, isn't it?
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck's that got to do with
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             They know I'm delivering for you. I
             mention the half-million - they don't
             give a fuck about that - They want
             you with guns. So I say, well, if you
             want proof he's getting paid for
             selling them, let me bring the money
             in.
   
                       ORDELL
             What did they say?
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes.
   
   Ordell smiles.
   
   They both slap palms.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY
   
   CLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.
   
   Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
   back, taking bong hits.
   
   As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;
   
                       MELANI
             ... so first he tries to get into the
             cocaine business but realizes right
             away that shit's too competitive.
             Piss the wrong person off, you get
             shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
             over to guns. You can sell guns
             wherever there's a demand. No one
             gives a shit. He acts like he's this
             big international arms dealer, when,
             come on, the only people he ever sold
             to were dopers.
   
   Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
   the coffee table to Melanie.
   
                       LOUIS
             He seems to be making out.
   
   Referring to the bong.
   
                       MELANIE
             Is it dead?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah.
   
   She starts preparing a bowl.
   
                       MELANIE
             Well, so far he is. But you have to
             admit he's not too bright.
   
                       LOUIS
             I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
   
   Melanie still preparing her bowl.
   
                       MELANIE
             He moves his lips when he reads, what
             does that tell ya. Let's say he's
             streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
             still a fuck-up.
   
   She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
   while holding in the smoke, says;
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             He killed a man worked for him the
             other night.
   
                       LOUIS
             So what are you trying to tell me? I
             should get out of here?
   
   Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
   shark smile.
   
                       MELANIE
             That's not what I'm saying at all.
             (pause) You know where he went?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             He went to meet that stewardess.
   
                       LOUIS
             Does that bother you?
   
   Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.
   
                       MELANIE
             Please.
   
                       LOUIS
             You live with him.
   
                       MELANIE
             I live here. He drops in and out. He
             tell you about that half-million
             dollars he's got in Mexico?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh?
   
                       MELANIE
             Course he did, he tells everybody
             who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
             with this stewardess. He's scheming
             how he can get it over here.
   
                       LOUIS
             And your point is?
   
                       MELANIE
             Let him and that stewardess get that
             money over here...
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh?
   
                       MELANI
             ... and just take it from him.
   
   
   INT. COCKATOO INN - DAY
   
   Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.
   
                       JACKI
             ... I make two deliveries. The first
             one with ten thousand, like a dry
             run. They watch it. See how it works.
             Then we do a second delivery, when I
             bring in the half mill.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
             ain't goin anywhere near that money.
   
                       JACKIE
             You don't have to. I told 'em you're
             real careful. You never pick up money
             yourself. You always send someone,
             and I never know who it is.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's a good idea.
   
                       JACKIE
             If you just listen, you'll see it's a
             damn good idea. The first time I do
             it they're lurking about. They see me
             hand the ten thousand to someone.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't know. One of your friends.
   
                       ORDELL
             A woman.
   
                       JACKIE
             If you want.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, I think a woman.
   
                       JACKIE
             The next trip, when I come with all
             the money, it'll look like I hand it
             to the same one I did before...
   
                       ORDELL
             But you don't?
   
                       JACKIE
             No, I give it to someone else first.
   
                       ORDELL
             And they follow the wrong one
             thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's the idea.
   
                       ORDELL
             So we need two people, two women.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can you cover that?
   
                       ORDELL
             I got the woman covered. Where you
             thinkin' about doin' this?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
             the food court.
   
                       ORDELL
             I suppose you see a piece of this for
             yourself?
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, it's my plan. We're in this
             together.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
             need me a partner.
   
                       JACKIE
             I ain't your partner, I'm your
             manager. I'm managing to get your
             money out of Mexico, into America, in
             your hands, and I'm managing to do
             all this under the nose of the cops.
             That makes me your manager, and
             managers get fifteen percent.
   
                       ORDELL
             Managers get ten percent.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's an agent. Manager's get
             fifteen percent.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'll give ya ten.
   
                       JACKIE
             Plus the same deal as before.
   
                       ORDELL
             I can do that.
   
   They clink their glasses together.
   
   
   CLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK
   
   It flips to 11:00 P.M.
   
   It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
   dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
   fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
   
   She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
   takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by
   the bed... she sees that her answering machine is
   flashing. She hits play.
   
   We begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never
   seeing Jackie again.
   
   The machine voice says;
   
                       MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
             You have on message. Sent at 8:06
             P.M.
   
   Max's voice comes out of the machine.
   
                       MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just
             calling to find out how everything
             went today with A.T.F. If you want to
             call me, my home number is 555-6788,
             or you can reach me at my office,
             which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on
             the card I gave you when we first met
             - I don't know if you still have that
             - but it's on it - Oh, let me give
             you my beeper number. It's 555-7839.
             Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope
             everything's well. Bye-bye.
   
                       MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
             End of message.

   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.
   
   A SUBTITLE reads:
   
   "DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN
   THE WORLD"
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the
   week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's
   not like it is on the weekend.
   
   The international food court, where fast-food versions of
   international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
   Amo Mall shoppers.
   
   Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She
   drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of
   Broadway shopping bags sit on the table.
   
   We join in mid-conversation.
   
                       JACKIE
             The money's in a Broadway shopping
             bag. I get some food, and sit down
             here in the food court. Then your
             girl comes - you got somebody yet?
   
                       ORDELL
             Uh-huh.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who?
   
                       ORDELL
             What'd you care?
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, it's my ass facin' the
             penitentiary. You send some hard-
             headed roc whore, and she fucks
             things up.
   
                       ORDELL
             I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The
             woman's cool, I promise.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY
   
   We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen
   theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early
   seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema,
   having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among
   them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL
   
   In the food court.
   
   Ordell rises from the table.
   
   Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.
   
                       JACKIE
             Don't forget your bag.
   
   He takes it.
   
   We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he
   stops...
   
   ... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.
   
   Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view.
   "What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"
   
   As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food
   court.
   
                       MAX
             walks into the food court. He stands
             looking a all the international fast
             food choices in front of him. As he
             tries to decide, he hears from behind
             him;
   
                       JACKIE (O.S.)
             Max.
   
   Max turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced
   tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him.
   
   Max smiles back.
   
                       MAX
             Well, hello.
   
                       JACKIE
             Surprise.
   
   He approaches her table.
   
                       MAX
             I walked right past you.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, ignoring me. What're you up
             to?
   
                       MAX
             Catching a movie.
   
                       JACKIE
             What'd ya see?
   
                       MAX
             "American Prseident"
   
                       JACKIE
             How was it?
   
                       MAX
             Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening
             are goin steady.
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, are you? Does she know that?
   
                       MAX
             No...
                   (sitting down at the
                   table)
             ... I don't believe she's ever heard
             of me. But that doesn't mean we're
             not going steady.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL
   
   Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at
   Jackie's table.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to himself)
             What's up with this shit.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       MAX
             I think falling in live with movie
             stars is something that happens to a
             man as he gets older.
   
                       JACKIE
             Does it happen to all men?
   
                       MAX
             Well, I'd never be so bold as to
             speak for all men, but as or myself
             and a few of my friends, that's
             definitely the case. There's a lot of
             actresses out there you like, and
             there's some you have crushes on. But
             there's always one who you love. And
             with her it's sorta like going
             steady.
   
                       JACKIE
             And Annette's it for you?
   
                       MAX
             For now. These relationships never
             last too long.
   
   With a smile on her face;
   
                       JACKIE
             That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
             even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
             star.
   
   Max smiles.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who was your girl before Annette?
   
                       MAX
             Sandra Bullock. You know her?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
             bus in "Speed." She's cute.
   
                       MAX
             She's adorable. But I had to end it.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why?
   
                       MAX
             I'm old enough to be her father.
   
                       JACKIE
             How old's Annette?
   
                       MAX
             I don't care.
   
   Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.
   
                       MAX
             What're you, a bag lady?
   
                       JACKIE
             I go back to work tomorrow.
   
                       MAX
             You talk them into it?
   
                       JACKIE
             They seem to like the idea.
   
                       MAX
             Bring the money in and they follow
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
             Put the money in a shopping bag and
             hand it to someone I meet here.
   
                       MAX
             You don't actually do it that way?
   
                       JACKIE
             He always just picked it up at my
             place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
             want to stage it. You know, make it
             look more intriguing, like we know
             what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
             up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
             follow the shopping bag.
   
                       MAX
             Make the delivery somewhere in the
             mall.
   
                       JACKIE
             Right around here, in the food court.
   
                       MAX
             Sit down, leave the bag under the
             table?
   
   Jackie nods her head "yes."
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Will Ordell go for that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm helping him bring his money into
             America. He loves the idea. You just
             missed him.
   
                       MAX
             He was here?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
             That's why all the bags.
   
                       MAX
             I called you last night.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, I got your message. Ray
             wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
             talk about the sting we're plotting.
             That's what he calls it. A sting.
             He's being real nice to me.
   
                       MAX
             You think he's got a thing for you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
             something like he wants the money for
             himself.
   
                       MAX
             I don't follow your logic. What does
             his being nice to you have to do with
             him wanting Ordell's money?
   
                       JACKIE
             He's setting me up to make a
             proposition.
   
                       MAX
             I see.
   
                       JACKIE
             You don't propose something like that
             unless you're pretty sure the other
             person's into it.
   
                       MAX
             Has he hinted around?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really. But I knew this narcotics
             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
             the whole package never gets back to
             the station. His exact words.
   
                       MAX
             You know some interesting people.
   
                       JACKIE
             We weren't bullshittin' either,
             'cause later he was suspended and
             forced to retire.
   
                       MAX
             Has Nicolet told you any colorful
             stories like that?
   
   She shakes her head "no."
   
                       JACKIE
             He tries to act cool.
   
                       MAX
             No harm in that. He's a young guy
             havin' fun being a cop. I know the
             type, trust me on this. He's more
             interested in Ordell than the money.
             If he's gonna do anything suspect,
             it'll be cutting corners to get the
             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
             with the money. It's evidence.
   
                       JACKIE
             What about you Max?
   
                       MAX
             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
   
                       JACKIE
             No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
             were somebody else.
   
                       MAX
             If I saw a way to walk off with a
             shopping bag full of money, would I
             take it?
   
                       JACKIE
             You know where it came from. It's not
             like it's anybody's life savings. It
             wouldn't even be missed.
   
                       MAX
             A half-a-million dollars will always
             be missed.
   
                       JACKIE
             You're avoiding the question.
   
                       MAX
             Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
             Especially now, since I'm getting out
             of the bail bonds business.
   
   Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
   doesn't say anything.
   
   Max continues.
   
                       MAX
             I have to stand behind all my active
             bonds, but I'm not writing any new
             ones.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why?
   
                       MAX
             A lot of reasons. But the main one
             would be I'm tired of it.
   
                       JACKIE
             When did you decide?
   
                       MAX
             It's been a long time coming. I
             finally made up my mind - I guess it
             was Thursday.
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   A RELEASE FORM
   
   With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
   WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
   her, handing her his business card.
   
                       MAX
             Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
             bondsman.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             The day you got me out of jail?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
             guy. I hear he's staying at this
             house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
             come home.
   
                       JACKIE
             Wait a minute. After we were together
             you went and snuck into a guy's
             house?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
   
   FLASH ON
   
   Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
   goodbye.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             I dropped you off...
   
   Max finding no gun in his glove box.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             Went to my office, found out you took
             my gun...
   
   Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
   and a stun gun.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             Got another gun and a stun gun...
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       MAX
             And went to this guy's house in El
             Monte, and I waited for him.
   
                       JACKIE
             What do you do when he comes home?
   
                       MAX
             Shoot him with the stun gun. While
             he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
             'em to County.
   
                       JACKIE
             You do that?
   
                       MAX
             That's my job.
   
                       JACKIE
             Did you do it that night?
   
                       MAX
             He never came home. But I'm sitting
             on the couch, in the dark, holding my
             stun gun and the whole house smells
             of mildew - So after a couple hours I
             think, "What am I doing here?
             Nineteen years of this shit? So I
             made up my mind, that's it.
   
                       JACKIE
             And is that it?
   
                       MAX
             More or less.
   
   Jackie takes a pause before saying;
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not sure you answered my
             question.
   
                       MAX
             Which one?
   
                       JACKIE
             If you had a chance, unemployed now,
             to walk off with a half-million
             dollars, would you take it?
   
                       MAX
             I believe I said I'd be tempted.
   
   Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.
   
                       MAX
             Don't even think about it. You could
             get yourself killed go to prison...
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             What if I've figured a way?
   
   Hold for a few beats, then...
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK.
   
   
   TITLE CARD:
   
   "MONEY EXCHANGE 10,000"
   
   Over this card, we hear an airplane landing.
   
                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Back at work, standing at the exit of her plane. All the
   passengers are filtering out. She says goodbye.
   
                       JACKIE
             Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye
             bye... Bye bye... Goodbye
   
   
   INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
   
   Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
   LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
   her.
   
   Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.
   
                       NICOLET
             We gotta stop meeting this way.
   
   Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's
   Honda.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
   
   The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
   She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the
   passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the
   flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila
   envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is
   very different from the first time they met. The three
   now almost act like friends.
   
                       DARGUS
             How was your flight?
   
                       JACKIE
             Fine.
   
                       DARGUS
             Bet you're happy to be working again.
   
                       NICOLET
             This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,
             Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money
             exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,
             July 4th 1997. The location is the
             parking structure at LAX.
   
                       JACKIE
             What are you doing?
   
   Pointing to a small mike on his lapel.
   
                       NICOLET
             I'm recording this.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were going to let this
             one through.
   
                       DARGUS
             We are. Don't worry about it.
   
                       NICOLET
             Every step of this goes in my report.
                   (back to report voice)
             I am now taking a manila envelope
             from the subject's flight bag.
   
   He opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             The envelope contains currency... all
             the same denomination, one-hundred-
             dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
   
                       DARGUS
             What time do you have to be there?
   
                       JACKIE
             Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's her name?
   
                       JACKIE
             He wouldn't say. You gonna follow
             her?
   
                       DARGUS
             She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
   
                       JACKIE
             But you're not going to stop her?
   
   Nicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up.
   
                       NICOLET
             The envelope contains ten thousand
             dollars. The subject will be
             delivering the currency in a...
   
                       JACKIE
             A Broadway shopping bag.
   
   She holds it up.
   
                       NICOLET
             A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag
             with handles and brown lettering.
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   The huge Del Amo Mall.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   The Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of
   the week.
   
   Max rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually
   strolls through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar
   called "BUSTA CAP" across from the food court. Walking up
   to the counter;
   
                       MAX
             Caf mocha.
   
                       BUSTA CAP GIRL
             You want whipped cream on that?
   
                       MAX
             No, thanks.
   
   Max checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food
   court and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself.
   
                                               FLASH ON:
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Jackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t-
   shirt and panties).
   
                       JACKIE
             Think of it as money that shouldn't
             even be here. I mean does anybody
             have a right to it?
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Max in his office on the phone.
   
                       MAX
             The feds. It's evidence.
   
                       JACKIE
             It may be evidence once they get
             their hands on it, but right now it's
             only money.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AT THE MALL
   
   He ponders his words as he watches her from a distance.
   
   
   INT. FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   Jackie sits at a table by herself, eating Japanese food
   from Teriyaki Donut and drinking an iced tea. As she eats
   she hears;
   
                       YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Is this seat taken?
   
   Jackie looks up and sees a skinny YOUNG GIRL, black,
   quite pretty, no older than twenty.
   
   She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
   beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway
   shopping bag hanging from her arm.
   
                       JACKIE
             Have a seat.
   
   The Young Girl does.
   
   Jackie looks at her tray of food.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             You're hungry?
   
                       YOUNG GIRL
             Yes'm.
   
   It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.
   
                       JACKIE
             Put your bag on the floor, okay?
             Under the table, right next to mine.
   
   The Young Girl who hasn't looked right at Jackie since
   sitting down, bends sideways to glance under the table.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Then when I leave, well, you know.
             What's your name?
   
   She looks up...
   
                       YOUNG GIRL
             Sherona?
   
   ... then back down at her tray.
   
                       JACKIE
             Go ahead, start eating.
   
   Sheronda starts eating, head down, hunching close to the
   tray.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Would it bother you if I smoked?
   
   Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to
   side.
   
   Jackie takes out a pack of Davidoffs and lights one up
   with her yellow Bic. As she does this she observes
   Sheronda eating.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Sheronda, can I ask you a question?
             Are you and Ordell married?
   
   Without raising her head.
   
                       SHERONDA
             He say we like the same thing as
             married.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you live together?
   
   Sheronda hesitates, then says without raising her head.
   
                       SHERONDA
             Most of the times.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not every day?
   
   Sheronda looks up at her...
   
                       SHERONDA
             Sometimes every day, for a while.
   
                       JACKIE
             Then you don't see him for a few
             days?
   
   ... She looks back down.
   
                       SHERONDA
             Yes'm.
   
                       JACKIE
             You know what's in the bag you're
             taking?
   
                       SHERONDA
             He say is a surprise.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking
             to you.
   
   Jackie picks up Sheronda's bag and leaves.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - BUSTA CAP - DAY
   
   Max drinking his caf mocha sans whipped cream, watches
   Jackie leave the Young Girl and with Broadway bag in
   hand, walk out of the food court.
   
   Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
   sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
   Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
   they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
   talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
   serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,
   nods her head again, and then walks off.
   
   As he watches her walk away from the cops...
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   JACKIE AND MAX ON PHONE
   
                       JACKIE
             You said it yourself. Ray wants
             Ordell, he don't give a shit about
             the money. Money won't convict him,
             guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in
             their lap, they take it. If they know
             they got it, they'll look for it...
             but if they don't...
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AT MALL
   
   Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the
   young girl eating in the food court.
   
   Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work
   her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
   to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
   older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
   her the ashtray Jackie was using.
   
   Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up
   from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway
   shopping bag and walks out of the food court.
   
   Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a
   little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.
   
   Max turns back on the older woman all alone.
   
   She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
   carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag. The
   woman heads out of the mall.
   
   Max follows her.
   
   The older woman walks past us. She heads straight for the
   exit.
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY
   
   Max follows the woman outside.
   
   She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan
   Mercury sedan. She drives of...
   
   ... but not before Max writes down her license plate
   number.

             You're rationalizing.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's what you do to go through with
             the shit you start. You rationalize.
             I can do this, Max, I know I can. But
             I can't do it without you.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - DAY
   
   Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives
   out of the parking lot.

   He hits 'play' on the dash CD player. The Delfonics fill

   A garage door is lifted open, revealing Ordell and Louis.
   
   
   EXT. STORAGE FACLITY - DAY
   
   Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A
   VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is
   pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             Check this out.
   
   He turns on the flashlight.
   
   He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
   filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
   rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.
   
                       LOUIS
             How much is there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Over half-million dollars worth of
             merchandise.
   
   Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start
   unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo.
   
                       LOUIS
             Can I ask you about Melanie?
   
                       ORDELL
             Sure.
   
                       LOUIS
             What's your relationship?
   
                       ORDELL
             She one of the women I got set up. I
             got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
             Simone a small house in Compton, and
             about four blocks away I got me this
             nineteen-year-old country girl named
             Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
             bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
             country as a chicken coop. Took her
             to my house in Compton, told her it
             was Hollywood.
   
                       LOUIS
             She believed you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
             Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
             ever been, anyway.
   
   They both laugh together.
   
                       LOUIS
             Do you trust Melanie?
   
   Ordell stops unloading.
   
                       ORDELL
             If this is about you fucked Melanie,
             I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
             I leave you alone with a bitch like
             Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
             twenty minutes after I'm out the
             door. So say "thank you" and I'll
             tell you, "you're welcome."
   
                       LOUIS
             That's not what I meant when I asked
             did you trust her.
   
   Ordell looks at him.
   
                       ORDELL
             She tryin' to work your ass against
             me, ain't she?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yep.
   
                       ORDELL
             You didn't even hafta say it. I know
             the woman.
   
                       LOUIS
             Well, why the fuck keep her around?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (smiling)
             'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.
             She can't do me no harm. Fact she
             think she can play you against me
             shows how little she knows. You could
             teach that bitch for days how it is
             'tween me an you, she never
             understand a damn word.
   
                       LOUIS
             Why do you let someone know your
             business you can't trust?
   
                       ORDELL
             I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
   
                       LOUIS
             What does that mean?
   
                       ORDELL
             You can't trust Melanie. But you can
             always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
   
   Louis starts unloading.
   
                       LOUIS
             I still don't understand why you keep
             her around.
   
                       ORDELL
             I told you, man.
                   (smiling)
             She my fine little surfer gal.

             What?
   
   
   JACKIE
   
   Bends down to talk in the speaker.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's Jackie.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
   
   Jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door.
   
   She rings the doorbell.
   
   The door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on
   the other side. Melanie, dressed in a t-shirt, cut offs,
   doesn't say a word - just turns around and walks away.
   
   Once Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the
   apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie;
   
                       ORDEL
             ... Now she's gonna pout...
   
   He turns his attention to Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.
   
   Jackie steps inside.
   
   She sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch.
   
   Ordell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the
   other room to hear;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             She gonna hafta find her sandals...
             find her bag... find her
             sunglasses... take twenty damn
             minutes get her ass out the door.
                   (to Jackie)
             Jackie - his is Louis, Louis -
             Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
             in the other room is Melanie.
   
   Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses,
   sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in
   her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without
   saying nothin' to nobody.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You have a nice time, hear?
   
   The door SLAMS behind her.
   
   Ordell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Drink?
   
                       JACKIE
             I need to talk to you alone.
   
   
   EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY
   
   Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't want no more fuckin'
             surprises. We do this the way I laid
             it out, or we don't do it at all.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the hell you talkin' bout?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sheronda passin' the money onto
             someone else, that's what the hell
             I'm talkin' 'bout.
   
                       ORDELL
             How do you know she did that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was there, I saw her do it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, you weren't supposed to be
             there.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
             figured you'd try an' pull some shit
             like this.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
             no shit. It's my money, I can do
             whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not when it's my ass on the line you
             don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
   
   Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.
   
                       ORDELL
             Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
             ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
             was my friend, Simone. She's the one
             gonna be receiving the money, so I
             just wanted her to see how it works.
             She'll be here any minute. Nice
             woman, you'll like her.
   
   Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
   living room;
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, call Simone and tell her to
             get her tail over here. We're waitin'
             on her ass.
   
   Louis gets up to make the call.
   
   Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
   screwdriver.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
             can't tempt you?
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
   
   Ordell and Jackie sit on stools around the kitchen
   counter/bar. Louis sits with them on the phone, silent.
   
                       JACKIE
             Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the
             airport and mark the bills.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, I don't like that part.
   
                       JACKIE
             It washes off. I tell them we're
             doing it the same way as before.
             They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
             idea of leaving her for a fall.
   
                       ORDELL
             She won't have no problems 'cause she
             don't know nothin'.
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you sure she don' know about the
             money?
   
                       ORDELL
             She don't know shit about the money.
   
                       JACKIE
             What does she think she's gettin?
   
                       ORDELL
             I told her this is a game us rich
             folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a
             scavenger hunt. She didn't know what
             that was neither.
                   (to Louis)
             No answer?
   
   Louis shakes his head.
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hang it up, she's on her way. You
             gotta listen to this. This involves
             you.
   
   Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             No, you gonna give her a
             Robinson's/May bag this time?
   
                       JACKIE
             Right, the one Simone gives me.
             Simone and I'll make the switch at
             Robinson's/May. She knows what I look
             like?
   
                       ORDELL
             She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone
             goes to the dress department with her
             Robinson's/May bag.
   
                       JACKIE
             Designer clothes.
   
                       ORDELL
             She waits for you to go in the place
             where you try things on.
   
                       JACKIE
             The fitting room. There's a sign over
             the door.
   
                       LOUIS
             Why we doin' I there?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
             me. We can't risk switching bags out
             in the open or even in the dining
             area. That's why it has to be a
             woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
             fitting room.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you come out with her
             Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
             Simone peeks out, waits for my man
             Louis here to give her a signal
             nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
             store, gets in her car - mission
             accomplished.
   
                       JACKIE
             Where you gonna be during all this?
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar
             In downtown L.A. till my man over
             here calls me and gives me the O.K.
             sign.
   
   Jackie's pager goes off. She looks at it.
   
                       JACKIE
             I gotta go.

                       ORDELL
             Who's paging you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
   
                       ORDELL
             That works on my nerves, you bein' so
             buddy-buddy with him.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now
             once I deliver I'll have to trust
             you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, I've been trusting you all this
             time, haven't I? We agreed on ten
             percent of what you bring in and
             that's what you gonna get.
   
   They reach the elevator. She presses the button.
   
                       JACKIE
             And a hundred thousand if I go to
             jail.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't
             gonna screw you. You haven't told me
             where I put it for you.
   
   The elevator arrives. Jackie steps in.
   
                       JACKIE
             Give it to the bail bondsman, Max
             Cherry. He'll take care of it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Max Cherry? You and him friends now?
             You tell him about this shit?
   
                       JACKIE
             He won't know where the money came
             from. Only that it's money.
   
   ... the elevator shuts... As it shuts Ordell yells;...
   
                       ORDELL
             Don't you know all them bail bondsmen
             are crooks...
   
   ... the door shuts.
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   He doesn't like the last piece of new information.
   
   
   EXT. THE STRAND - DAY
   
   The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa
   Beach. Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to
   her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called,
   "Sally Leroy's."
   
   
   INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY
   
   Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different
   beer signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis
   Presley, James Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding
   monster waves all over the place.
   
   The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.
   
   
   BEGINNING OF SHOT
   
   The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
   into the place and going up to the bar...
   
   A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
   workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you have a phone?
   
                       WANDA
             Yeah, it's in the back.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks.
   
   ... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
   MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
   older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
   like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
   As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
   head of hair comes into the f.g....
   
   The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
   on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
   Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.
   
   END OF SHOT
   
   Jackie hears behind her;
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Hey!
   
   Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing
   behind her.
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, hi.
   
                       MELANIE
             Buy ya a beer?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm waiting for the phone.
   
                       MELANIE
             Good luck. That guy's been in there
             since I got here.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I guess I better look for
             another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
   
   Jackie turns to leave.
   
                       MELANIE
             I know what you and Ordell got goin'.
             You sit down and have a beer with me.
             I'll tell you a secret.
   
   Jackie looks at her a moment.
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
                       MELANIE
             Great...
                   (calling to the
                   bartender)
             ... Wanda!
   
   Wanda approaches.
   
                       WANDA
             What?
   
                       MELANIE
             This lady is thirsty.
   
                       WANDA
             What do you want?
   
                       MELANIE
             What's on tap?
   
                       WANDA
             Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and
             Killian's Red.
   
                       JACKIE
             Killian's.
   
                       MELANIE
             Better get me another Sam's.
                   (to Jackie)
             Join me in a Jaeger shot?
   

                       JACKIE
             Uh-uh.
             
                       MELANIE
             Gimme one anyway.
   
                       WANDA
             You got it.
             
   Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The
   MUSIC is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie
   moves her head to it during the conversation.
   
                       JACKIE
             How long you been with Ordell?
   
                       MELANIE
             This time? Almost a year. I've known
             him forever.
   
                       JACKIE
             What were you two fighting about?
   
                       MELANIE
             He told me to go outside.
                   (imitating Ordell's
                   voice)
             "You may leave us now." It's all part
             of his pathetic attempt to be "the
             man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
   
   Jackie nods "yes."
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about
             Ordell.
   
                       JACKIE
             That coke was yours, wasn't it?
   
   Melanie makes a face to show pain.
   
                       MELANIE
             Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about
             that. I hope they don't come down on
             you on my account. Ordell shoulda
             told you it was in your bag.
   
   Wanda brings the drinks.
   
                       WANDA
             Seven dollars.
   
   Melanie digs in her purse for the money.
   
                       JACKIE
             He said he didn't know about it.
   
                       MELANIE
                   (digging in her purse)
             You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess
             you have to trust him.
                   (pulls out a ten)
             I'd have second thoughts on that, but
             then I know 'em.
   
   Melanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then
   continues.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             He killed a guy who works for him the
             other day.
   
                       JACKIE
             Beaumont Livingston?
   
                       MELANIE
             You already knew that?
   
                       JACKIE
             Kinda.
   
                       MELANIE
             So tell me. Having all that money in
             your flight bag - Is it tempting?
   
   Jackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to
             carry in ten thousand dollars, that
             would be the last motherfuckin' time
             he saw me. The next trip you're gonna
             have over half-a-million. If you
             thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure
             as hell wouldn't blame you.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             You think I'm kidding?
   
                       JACKIE
             Dreaming.
   
                       MELANIE
             You know how easy it would be? He
             won't be anywhere near that mall.
             Pull one more switch, up front.
             That's it. half-a-million dollars.
             Need help?
   
                       JACKIE
                   (smiling)
             Keep it between us girls?
   
                       MELANIE
             What's that fucker ever done for us?
   
                       JACKIE
                   (getting off the
                   barstool)
             I don't think so, but thanks for the
             beer.
   
   Jackie leaves.
   
   
   CLOSEUP MELANIE
   
   Watches her go.
   
                       MELANIE
                   (softly under her breath)
             Chicken shit.
   
   
   INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
   
   Jackie and Nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak
   dinner. Nicolet drinks beer, Jackie drinks white wine.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell has a white guy working for
             him named Louis.
   
                       NICOLET
             You two meet?
   
                       JACKIE
             This afternoon before I came here. He
             was with Ordell at an apartment in
             Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he
             lives there, but I can find out.
   
                       NICOLET
             You talk to him?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really.
   
                       NICOLET
             His full name is Louis Gara. He just
             got out from serving four years in
             Susanville.
   
                       JACKIE
             What for?
   
                       NICOLET
             Bank robbery? Do you know what he
             does for Ordell?
   
                       JACKIE
             I imagine shit needs to be done.
   
                       NICOLET
             We've been following Mr. Gara, and
             he's definitely working for Ordell.
   
                                               FLASH ON:
   
   
   NICOLET AND DARGUS
   
   In a car, parked, on surveillance.
   
   
   COPS POV
   
   Louis with the van, at the storage facility.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             They served two years together almost
             twenty years ago in Soledad. But he
             doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.
             Ordell's got him staying at a house
             in.
   
   
   MUG SHOT SIMONE
   
   The older woman in the mall.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             ... Compton with a fifty-six-year-
             old petty thief - woman named Simone
             Hawkins.
   
   
   BACK TO BAR
   
                       NICOLET
             Ever meet her, or they talk about
             her?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not yet.
   
                       NICOLET
             Who's the other one?
   
                       JACKIE
             White girl named Melanie Ralston.
             Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's her story?
   
                       JACKIE
             It was her coke I got busted with.
             She knows everything, but she's not
             part of it, and she's pissed cause
             she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't
             even let her stay at the meeting. She
             tried to talk me into ripping off
             Ordell.
   
                       NICOLET
             And splittin' with her?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm sure that was the idea.
   
                       NICOLET
             What did you say?
   
                       JACKIE
             I smiled and walked away. She also
             told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
   
                       NICOLET
             She told you that?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             Was she there?
   
                       JACKIE
             She didn't say.
   
                       NICOLET
             But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well, this sounds like a lady I'd
             like to have a word with. So
             everything's set for tomorrow?
   
                       JACKIE
             Right. Everything's the same, except
             one change...
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
   white wine.
   
   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
   
   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
   what she wants them to think.
   
   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
   an all-important competition.
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them Ordell's changed the
             amount he's bringing in.
   
                       MAX
             Do you think they bought it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
             Ordell's real nervous. They love
             thinking he's scared of them.
   
                       MAX
             You know, a good cop won't let you
             know he knows you're fulla shit.
   
                       JACKIE
             All he needed was a reasonable
             explanation.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET
   
   MEDIUM JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             Right. Everything's the same except
             one change. Ordell thinks it's just
             too hot right now to bring in all his
             money. He knows you're watching him,
             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
             stash where it is, but he wants to
             bring in fifty thousand for bail in
             case he needs it.

   BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX
   
                       MAX
             It'll be more than that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
   
                       MAX
             But you still have to show him the
             money at the airport.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, you know I'm not going to show
             him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
             thousand.
   
                       MAX
             Where's the rest of it?
   
                       JACKIE
             In the bag underneath.
   
                       MAX
             What if he checks it?
   
                       JACKIE
             He won't - I mean, he didn't the last
             time. He'll be expecting fifty
             thousand and there it is - on top.
   
                       MAX
             You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.
             Walker put the money in, and I didn't
             know nothing about it. Like the coke.
   
                       MAX
             Then you're out and you get nothing.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I
             tried.
   
                       MAX
             You're gonna have surveillance all
             over you.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why you don't make a move till
             I come out of the fitting room.
   
                       MAX
             In a dress.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, a suit. There's one I had my
             eye on.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Excuse me.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone
   
                       ORDELL
             It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
             in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout
             - everything's the same - except for
             one change. That bitch you saw in the
             mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,
             cause she split on me.
                   (pause)
             Me an Louis went over to her place
             ,she's gone. She's gone and all her
             shit's gone and so's my ten thousand
             dollars.
                   (pause)
             It ain't nothin' to worry about,
             girl. Everything's just like we
             discussed. Except when you do the
             switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna
             be Melanie.
   
   Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
   Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
   watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.
   
   
   ON TV
   
   Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
   pursued by police cars.
   
   They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
   Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
   foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
   gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
   So knock it of."
   
   Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.
   
   Louis turns back to the television.
   
   
   CLOSEUP MELANIE
   
   Looks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her
   breath;

             Chicken shit.

   tiny figure of a black AIRPLANE appears in the Cabo
   circle. With appropriate SOUND EFFECTS it takes off from
   Cabo, flying towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind
   it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black

   Rearranging her bag. The five hundred thousand inside
   takes up half the space. She tucks lingerie around the
   edges, covers the money with blouses, shoes, and skirts
   and ties I all down tight. Then places a fat envelope
   with fifty thousand right on top.
   
   
   INT. CABIN - AIRPLANE - DAY
   
   Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle,
   and is stopped by a PASSENGER.
   
                       PASSENGER
             Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink
             and you spend half the fuckin' flight
             in the can. Soon as we land I'm
             making a formal complaint.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why, because I called you an asshole.
   
                       PASSENGER
             You didn't call me that.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't? Oh, well, you're an
             asshole.

   Jackie steps into the LAX parking structure, pulling her
   bag on wheels behind her.
   
   Waiting for her is Ray Nicolet.
   
                       NICOLET
             We have to stop meeting like this.
   
   They fall into step towards her car.
   
                       JACKIE
             You said that the last time.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well, it's true, isn't it? After his
             is buttoned up we could meet
             someplace else. What do you think?
   
                       JACKIE
             We could, if I'm not in jail.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, that's taken care of. I called
             the State Attorney's Office. You were
             no-filed this morning in Circuit
             Court.

   This information stops Jackie in her tracks.
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you saying I'm off the hook?
   
   
   JACKIE'S POV
   
   Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back
   at Jackie.
   
                       NICOLET
             Free as a bird. I still expect you to
             finish the job, though. How much do
             you have this time?
   
   Jackie starts walking again
   
                       JACKIE
             Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
             pretty sure he's gonna need it for
             bail.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
   
   Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight
   bag in his lap.
   
   He unzips it.
   
   He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.
   
   Jackie watches all of this.
   
                       NICOLET
             That's fifty thousand, huh? It
             doesn't look like that much.
   
                       JACKIE
             I was told ten thousand in each pack.
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't count it?
   
                       JACKIE
             I never have. It's not my money.
   
   He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through
   the folds of a skirt.
   
                       NICOLET
             He might have slipped some coke in
             here. Did you check?
   
   Jackie, cool.
   
                       JACKIE
             Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
             that again.
   
   Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged
   into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over
   to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five
   rubber-banded bond packets of loot.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Ever been tempted?
   
                       NICOLET
             What? To put one of these in my
             pocket?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             If I did, I'd have to give you one,
             wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
             want. No one knows how much there is
             except us, right?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes. All those things are true.
   
                       NICOLET
             After all, it don't belong to nobody,
             right?
   
                       JACKIE
             That would be one point of view.
   
                       NICOLET
             Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
             that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
             evidence, it belongs to us. You are
             now officially out of trouble. Don't
             do nothing stupid, now.
   
                       JACKIE
             How can I do anything if I'm being
             watched every second?
   
                       NICOLET
             I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
             the trouble of pointing it out to
             you.
                   (holding up the money)
             Put this in your shopping bag. It's
             what I expect to find when I look in
             Sheronda's. Comprende?
   
                       JACKIE
             Si.

             get something to eat.

             Watcha gonna see?

             I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.
   
   Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
   retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, you the one in motherfuckin'
             charge.

             Go in there, snatch her by the hair,
             and drag her big ass out. This is my
             goddam money we're talking about. Get
             your ass out the door.
   
   He hangs up on Louis.

   that, hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where

   the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
   
   Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
   fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
   thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
   envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
   the rest of the bag with beach towels.
   
   Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
   carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
   confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
   the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.

             Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
             on.
   
   Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
   sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
   
   Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.
   
                       JACKIE
             This looks pretty good on me.
   
                       AMY
             Are you kidding, it looks great. You
             wear this to a business meeting,
             you're the badass in the room. But
             you can go out dancing in this too.
             It's a total power suit.
   
   Jackie studies her reflection.
   
                       JACKIE
             I think I'm gonna just get this for
             today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
             you mind ringing this up while I
             change out of it?
   
                       AMY
             Not a problem.

   INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY
   
   She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
   cubicles on her right, enters the last one.
   
   She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
   her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.
   
   A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
   looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
   next to her.
   
   Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.

                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Are you getting that black suit?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, do you like it?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             It looks good on you.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you got something for me?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             You betcha.
   
   A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
   comes sliding underneath the stall.
   
   Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
   books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.
   
   She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
   and lies it on top of the bag.
   
   As she does all this Melanie continues talking.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             We coulda worked this. You know that,
             dontcha? You would've made out a lot
             better than you're going to, believe
             me.
   
   Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
   stall.
   
   Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.
   
                       JACKIE
             I put a little cherry on top. You're
             right. What the hell he ever do for
             us?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
                   (quietly)
             Thanks.
   
                       JACKIE
             Now be careful with that bag. You
             don't want it ripping open on you in
             the middle of the store.
   
   We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
   
   Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
   of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
   sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
   
   Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
   She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
   Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.
   
   
   INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
   
   Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
   frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
   counter where Amy waits for her.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
             the suit - get out of that damn
             uniform.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, that's not a problem.
   
   As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
   the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
   RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
   as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
   
   She leaves. We follow her...
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   ... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
   main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
   Jackie is completely gone.
   
   She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
   to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
   twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
   she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
   tears.
   
   As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
             took the money.
   
   The CAMERA stops twirling.
   
   Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come
   running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her,
   a frantic Jackie yells;
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Melanie burst in the dressing room
             and took the money!
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Louis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in
   Melanie's Toyota.
   
   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TIME: 4:12"
   
   Louis is the first out of the car.
   
                       LOUIS
             Come on, goddammit, we're late!
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   We STEDICAM in front of them, Louis the rapid pacesetter,
   pulling Melanie behind him by the hand. Melanie carries
   the Robinson's/May switch bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
   
                       LOUIS
             We shoulda been there already and we
             woulda been if it hadn't been for
             your fuckin' around!
   
   They go inside Robinson's/May...
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
   
   ... We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose
   them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins,
   but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking
   in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes
   floor.
   
                       AM
             ... You wear this to a business
             meeting, you're the badass in the
             room...
   
   We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
   watching Jackie.
   
                       MELANIE
             That's a nice outfit on her. I'm
             gonna go over and look at this Michi
             Moon display.
   
                       LOUIS
             Just stay right fuckin' here, all
             right?
   
                       MELANIE
             Are you sweating?
   
   Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
   dampness.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Job a little too much for you?
   
   Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.
   
   Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
   a natural-born smart ass to change.
   
                       MELANIE
             I'll be over here. You're too
             conspicuous.
   
   Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
   inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
   him.
   
   He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
   time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
   
                       LOUIS
                   (under his breath)
             Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
   
   He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
   much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
   something that stops him cold.
   
   
   MAX CHERRY
   
   Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
   fitting room.
   
   He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
   
   Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
   staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
   Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
   to do what he was doing.
   
   He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
   any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
   Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
   register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
   there are doing customer stuff.
   
   Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
   and head down a different aisle.
   
   He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
   fight is said tense and low.
   
                       LOUIS
             What are you doin'?
   
                       MELANIE
             I'm getting out of here. What do you
             think?
   
                       LOUIS
             Lemme have the bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Fuck you. I can carry it.
   
   She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
   and pulls her around.
   
                       LOUIS
             Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
   
                       MELANIE
             Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
             fuckin' bag?
   
                       LOUIS
             Gimme that bag before I knock you out
             and take it.
   
   Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
   that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
   the bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
             wrong with you?
   
   He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
   them.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm carrying it.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
             pill, for christ sake.
   
   Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
   through gritted teeth;
   
                       LOUIS
             Fuck you with your chill pill.
   
   In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;
   
                       MELANIE
             Remember where we came in?
   
   Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
                   (like a teacher on Romper
                   Room)
             Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
             in through Bullocks. I know where it
             is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
   
   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
   smirk, follows behind.
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
   
   Melanie follows close behind.
   
   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
   see he has a searching look on his face.
   
                       MELANIE
             You have no idea where you parked, do
             you?
   
   Louis doesn't answer.
   
   Melanie laughs.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Jesus, but if you two aren't the
             biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
             life... How did you ever rob a bank?
             When you robbed banks, did you have
             to look for your car then too? No
             wonder you went to jail.
   
   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
   up.
   
   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, down the end.
   
                       MELANIE
             You sure?
   
   They walk it; it's not it.
   
   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
   next one.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Is it this aisle or the next one
             over?
   
                       LOUIS
             This one.
   
                       MELANIE
             You sure?
   
   In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
   
                       LOUIS
             Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
             telling you, keep your mouth shut.
   
   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
   
                       LOUIS
             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
             word.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, Lou-is.
   
   That did it!
   
   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
   her... BAM... in the belly.
   
   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
   
   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
   
   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
   
   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
   HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
   
                       LOUIS
             See, just where I fuckin' said it
             was!
   
   He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
   
   We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
   cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
   and yells through the passenger window;
   
                       LOUIS
             Hey, look. I found it!
   
   He drives away.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
   in the parking lot.
   
   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TIME: 4:04"
   
   Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
   Del Amo Mall.
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
   
   Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
   Robinson's/May store.
   
   He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
   the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
   
                       SALESGIRL
             Can I show you something?
   
                       MAX
             Not right now. I'm just killing time
             waiting for my wife. But thanks,
             anyway.
   
                       SALESGIRL
             Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
             don't be shy.
   
                       MAX
             Thanks, I won't.
   
   She goes off.
   
   He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
   out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
   
   Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
   
   Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
   his breath;
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (low)
             And away we go.
   
   Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
   a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
   
   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
   Clothes.
   
   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
   on a rack.
   
   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
   
   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
   
   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
   
   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
   
   Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
   the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
   his before he can see a reaction.
   
   Max continues his fake browsing.
   
   He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
   Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
   
   She and Louis disappear.
   
   He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
   Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
   cash, then leaves stopping to say;
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
   
   She's gone.
   
   Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
   
   It's Max's turn.
   
   As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
   he says to himself;
   
                       MAX
             Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
             years dealing with people who take
             incredible risks. You walk over to
             that counter, you're gonna find out
             what it's like.
   
   Max takes a few moments...
   
   ... then walks over to Amy.
   
                       MAX
             Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
             left a bag of beach towels in the
             fitting room?
   
                       AMY
             Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
             get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
             think they're in the last stall.
   
                       MAX
             Thanks.
   
   Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
   the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
   
   He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
   towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
   Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
   
                       MAX
             Got 'em, thanks.
   
                       AMY
             Sure thing.
   
   Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
   parking lot.
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
   
   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
   He made it. It worked.
   
   Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
   his half-a-million bucks and drives away.
   
   
   INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY
   
   Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
   and watching a stripper strip.
   
                       BARTENDER
             There a Ordell here?
   
                       ORDELL
             That's me.
   
   The bartender hands him the phone.
   
                       BARTENDER
             Don't talks all day.
   
   Ordell takes the receiver.
   
   
   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
   
   A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on
   Ordell's tiny cellular.
   
                       LOUIS
             It's Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (now into phone)
             Did you get it?
   
                       LOUIS
             I got it. Listen, there's something
             else I have to tell you.
   
                       ORDELL
             When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
             You count the money?
   
                       LOUIS
             I haven't even looked at it yet, it's
             still in the shopping bag.
   
                       ORDELL
             Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
                   (pause)
             Louis.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's what I got to talk to you
             about. You see, Melanie was giving me
             a hard time -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Not now, pick me up.
   
   Louis hears the phone disconnect.
   
   
   EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR - DAY
   
   The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
   in, the car takes off.
   
   
   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
   
   Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
   backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
   lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.
   
                       ORDELL
             You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
             they got all them car dealerships.
             We're gonna leave this heap in a
             parking lot and get one the cops
             don't know about.
                   (pause)
             Hey, where's Melanie?
   
                       LOUIS
             That's what I gotta tell you. She
             bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
             with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
             carry the bag. Started running her
             fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
             right away when we came out where the
             car was parked, so she got on me
             about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
             is it that one?" She was totally
             fuckin' with my nerves.
   
                       ORDELL
             So what, you left her there.
   
                       LOUIS
             I shot her.
   
   Ordell just looks at him.
   
                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
             I expect she's dead.
   
   Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;
   
                       ORDELL
             You shot Melanie?
   
                       LOUIS
             Twice. In the parking lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Couldn't talk to her?
   
                       LOUIS
             You know how she is.
   
                       ORDELL
             You couldn't just hit her?
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe... but at that moment... I
             dunno...
   
                       ORDELL
             You shot her twice?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you're sure she's dead.
   
                       LOUIS
             Pretty sure.
   
                       ORDELL
             Where did you shoot her?
   
                       LOUIS
             In the chest and stomach.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, if you had to do it, you had to
             do it. What we don't want is that
             bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
             that woman.
   
   Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
   pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
   top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
   looks inside the bag for the longest time.
   
   Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (quiet)
             Louis?
   
                       LOUIS
                   (not looking at him)
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             Where's the rest of it?
             
                       LOUIS
                   (looking at him)
             How much it there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
   
                       LOUIS
             You said five hundred and fifty!
   
                       ORDELL
                   (calm)
             So you light, ain't you. You light
             about a half-a-million.
   
                       LOUIS
             Look, that's the bag she came out
             with. She never even put her hand in
             it, and neither did I.
   
                       ORDELL
             Came outta where?
   
                       LOUIS
             The fitting room. It went down
             exactly the way it was supposed to.
   
                       ORDELL
             How long was she in there?
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe a minute. She came right out.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
   
                       LOUIS
             Look, I swear to fucking god, she
             came out with that bag and I took it
             from her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then what?
   
                       LOUIS
             We went to the parking lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Where you shot her.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's right.
   
                       ORDELL
             You sure she ain't somewhere with a
             half-a-million dollars I worked my
             ass off to earn?
   
   Louis looks at Ordell;
   
                       LOUIS
                   (quietly)
             Fuck you for asking me that.
   
                       ORDELL
             Pull the car over.
   
   Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             What'd you shoot her with?
   
                       LOUIS
             It's in there.
   
   Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
   smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.
   
                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
             What's that gonna tell you" If I was
             really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
             two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
             trusted me.
   
   Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   He thinks.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and
   saying with a smile;
   
                       JACKIE
             Gotcha, nigga.
   
                                               DISSOLVE BACK
                                               TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the
   Beretta.
   
                       ORDELL
             Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
   
                       LOUIS
             If she's got it, why didn't she take
             it all?
   
                       ORDELL
             'fore I blow that bitch's brains out,
             I'll ask her.
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe the Feds got it.
   
                       ORDELL
             If there were nothin; in here but
             towels, maybe she didn't get a chance
             to take it from her suitcase and
             A.T.F. got it. But, she put these
             fuckin' books in here to trick our
             ass.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's why I never checked it. The
             bag felt right.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then she throws forty thousand in
             here, to rub the shit in my face,
             know what I'm saying? She wants me to
             know she ripped me off.
   
                       LOUIS
             I don't know. Either she has it or
             the Feds.
   
                       ORDELL
             Or...
                   (pause)
             ... she gave it to somebody else
             first, before Melanie went in the
             dressing room.
   
   It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers
   something.
   
                       LOUIS
             Jesus Christ.
   
                       ORDELL
             What?
   
                       LOUIS
             You know who I saw in the dress
             department?
   
                       ORDELL
             Tell me.
   
                       LOUIS
             I didn't really think anything of it.
             No - I did wonder what he was doing
             there, but didn't think it had
             anything to do with us. You know like
             maybe he was there with his wife or
             girlfriend.
   
                       ORDELL
             You gonna tell me who it was?
   
                       LOUIS
             Max Cherry.
   
   Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then
   looks back.
   
                       ORDELL
             You see Max Cherry in the dress
             department. We're about to be handed
             half-a-million dollars - Man, look at
             me when I'm talking to you! And you
             don't think nothing of him being
             there!
   
                       LOUIS
             Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
             each other?
   
                       ORDELL
             Hell, yes, they know each other. He
             bonded her out of county.
   
                       LOUIS
             How am I supposed to know that?
   
                       ORDELL
             You know the motherfucker's a bail
             bondsman, don't ya? You know every
             last one of them motherfuckers is
             crooked as hell?
   
                       LOUIS
             Why should I think anything's weird,
             if I don't know nothin' about them
             knowing each other?
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, I don't want to hear your
             fuckin' excuses!
   
   Louis gets mad.
   
                       LOUIS
             I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,
             I'm givin' you reasons.
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
             lost all the goddam money I got in
             the world! Let me tell you the
             reason, motherfucker! The reason is,
             your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
   
   Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
   Ordell;
   
                       LOUIS
                   (hard)
             You best back off.
   
   We hear a BAM.
   
   Louis jerks.
   
   Ordell shot him.
   
   Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
   staring at Ordell.
   
   Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
   Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.
   
   This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
   He slumps over - his life gone.
   
   Ordell looks at him.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck happened to you, man?
             Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.
   
   Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving
   Louis' dead body there.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   MEDIUM NICOLET
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't tell me you were gonna do
             some shopping.
   
   
   INT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) - DAY
   
   Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a
   chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers
   of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of
   coffee in he other.
   
   Ray stands.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought I did.
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't. I would think with all
             this on your mind, you'd wait till
             after.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got there early. I've had my eye on
             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
             got there early. The idea was to try
             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
             did, get them to wrap it up, and
             change back into my uniform. That's
             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
             with fifty thousand, and go home.
   
                       NICOLET
             But you didn't do that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
             swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
             it.
                   (pause)
             And someone killed her for it.
   
   Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.
   
                       NICOLET
             Where's the bag she gave you?
   
                       JACKIE
             She didn't give me one. I told you
             before, Melanie wasn't part of the
             plan. Ordell must of told her to do
             it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
             bag, and takes off. What am I
             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
             my fucking underwear. I had to get
             dressed before I could do anything.
             So I put this back on 'cause could
             put this on faster than I could my
             uniform.
   
                       NICOLET
             You took the time to pay the
             saleswoman.
   
                       JACKIE
             I had to. I was frantic. I didn't
             know what to do.
   
                       NICOLET
             What did you do after that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I went looking for you. I went
             straight to the bookstore, 'cause
             that's where you were last time, but
             you weren't there. How the hell else
             am I supposed to let anybody know
             what happened? You didn't tell me how
             to do that, did you? I knew I was
             under surveillance, so when I
             couldn't spot anybody, I started
             yelling.
   
                       NICOLET
             There was a guy with Melanie?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not in the fitting room.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT
   
   Pretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             We had our agent on you. She sees a
             blonde come out of the fitting room
             carrying a Robinson's/May bag and
             tussle with a tough-looking white
             guy. The white guy takes the shopping
             bag and they go.
   
   
   BACK TO OFFICE
   
                       NICOLET
             This guy with Melanie, that was Louis
             Gara?
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't see him. I was in my
             underwear. If it was a white guy, it
             was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
   
                       NICOLET
             It's possible. You're saying you
             don't have any idea what happened to
             that fifty thousand?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have no idea.
   
                       NICOLET
             You'd take a polygraph on it?
   
                       JACKIE
             If it'll make you happy.
   
                       NICOLET
             I sure hope you haven't done anything
             dumb Jackie.
   
   Dargus comes to the doorway...
   
                       DARGUS
                   (to Nicolet)
             Can I have a word with you?
   
                       NICOLET
             Sure.
   
   They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the
   room, smoking.
   
   They both come back in.
   
   Nicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner
   saying nothing.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
             dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
             lost Ordell.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were watching him.
   
                       NICOLET
             We were, and we lost him. He walked
             into a strip bar sometime around
             three thirty and never came out. The
             bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
             and-a-half from where Louis was found
             dead. It looks like Louis's friend
             shot him twice at point blank range.
   
                       JACKIE
             So what happens now?
   
                       NICOLET
             We pick up Ordell. We've got three
             murders we can link him to. We have
             the storage unit where he keeps his
             guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
             warrant to go in and get him. And we
             have you.
   
                       JACKIE
             What about me?
   
                       NICOLET
             What about you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you think I took some of that
             money?
   
                       NICOLET
             I have no evidence of your taking
             anything. You didn't pay for your
             snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
             was glad to see that. You've been
             helping us out, you gave us Melanie
             and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
             marked bills stuffed in her shorts
             when they found her, which goes a
             long way backing up your story.
   
   Jackie listens.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             I'll settle for Ordell with the
             marked bills.
   
                       NICOLET
             If you have something else going on
             you haven't told me about, it's
             between you and Ordell. All I gotta
             say is, you better hope we find him
             before he finds you.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   On the phone.
   
                       ORDEL
             ... I can't leave here today... Mr.
             Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I
             get my money... You wouldn't have
             that fuckin' boat weren't for me.
             Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my
             friends are... Mr. Walker?
   
   
   INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - DAY
   
   Ordell turn to a glassy-eyed black female junkie nodding
   on the couch named RAYNELLE. The filthy apartment we're
   in belongs to her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Can you believe that shit?
             Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate
             nigger. Do things for people and
             that's how they treat you. Goddamn
             girl, how can you live like this?
   
   He dials another number.
   
                       RAYNELLE
                   (stoned)
             Like what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Girl, this shit is repugnant.

             Let me speak to Max Cherry.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Winston behind his desk, on the phone.
   
                       WINSTON
             He ain't here right now.
   
                       ORDELL
             He leave town?
   
                       WINSTON
             He's around.
   
                       ORDELL
             Give me his home number.
   
                       WINSTON
             I'll give you his beeper.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A YOUNG BLACK COMEDIAN ON TV
   
   Def Comedy Jam plays on TV, a black comedian does a nasty
   stand-up routine.
   
   
   INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell and Raynelle sit on the couch watching Def Comedy
   Jam; neither one is laughing. Raynelle's too stoned.
   Ordell's too tense. The phone rings, he jumps on it
   
                       ORDELL
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on
   the edge of the desk listening.
   
                       MAX
             I've been looking for you.
   
   Ordell's up and off the couch pacing.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know who this is?
   
                       MAX
             Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the
             ten thousand you put up. Isn't that
             why you called.
   
   Ordell doesn't say anything.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             The bond collateral on Beaumont
             Livingston you moved over to cover
             Miss Brown, remember?
   
                       ORDELL
             She got off, huh?
   
                       MAX
             They decided to no-file. Tell me
             where you are and I'll bring you your
             money.
   
   Ordell doesn't say anything.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You still there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Looky here, I know you helped her and
             I know you know what I want Jackie
             can tell me any story come in that
             pretty head of hers. Long as at the
             end of that story, she hands over my
             money. She do that, we're still
             friends. Now, she don't wanna be my
             friend no more, tell her to think
             about ol' Louis. And if she tries to
             turn me in, I'll name her ass as my
             accessory. We'll go upstate together.
             Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that
             shit's a promise, understand what I'm
             sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll
             call you back.
   
   Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One
   of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs.
   
   Max looks at Winston.
   
                       MAX
             You're right, that was Ordell. You
             have time, you think you could find
             out for me where he's staying?
   
                       WINSTON
             Cops can't locate him, huh?
   
                       MAX
             They don't have your winning
             personality.
   
                       WINSTON
             Sure thing. I don't have to know what
             I'm doing, long as you know.
   
                       MAX
             I think I do. Is that good enough?
   
   
   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
   rooms.
   
   
   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
   
   Jackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and
   panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.
   
   She answers the phone.
   
                       JACKIE
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT
   
   Max on the phone in his office, alone.
   
                       MAX
             I know where he is.
   
   This gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the
   TV set and zaps the sound.
   
                       JACKIE
             How'd you find out?
   
                       MAX
             All Winston had to do was ask around.
             Ordell's living in Long Beach with a
             woman junkie.
   
                       JACKIE
             How does Winston find him if A.T.F.
             and all the local Police can't?
   
                       MAX
             People talk to Winston. He's street,
             same as them, they trust him. They
             get busted, they know somebody who
             can bond them out. I thought I might
             drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
             surprised to see me.
   
                       JACKIE
             He's liable to shoot you.
   
                       MAX
             On the phone I told him I have the
             ten thousand he put up for your bond.
             I could bring the money and the
             papers for him to sign. Walk out and
             call the Sheriff's department.
   
   Jackie gets off the bed.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray wants him.
   
                       MAX
             Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
             suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
             him in, he's gonna name you as an
             accessory.
   
   Jackie lights up a Davidoff.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
             case. I'm their witness. They
             wouldn't have a case without me. If
             it's his word against mine, who are
             they gonna believe?
   
                       MAX
             It's not that simple.
   
   Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins
   pacing back and forth.
   
                       JACKIE
             It never was, so I'm not gonna start
             worrying about it now. Look, Ray more
             or less believes my story, and he
             more or less doesn't care. All he
             really gives a shit about is getting
             Ordell.
   
                       MAX
             So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
   
                       JACKIE
             Get Ordell to come to your office.
   
                       MAX
             Set him up.
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MAX
             Tell him you want to see him?
   
                       JACKIE
             Tell him I want to give him his
             money.
   
                       MAX
             Why?
   
                       JACKIE
             I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
             him. He'll like that.
   
                       MAX
             What do you tell Nicolet?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell called and wants to meet me
             and I'm scared.
   
                       MAX
             We get Ordell to come to my office.
             Nicolet - is he already there, or
             does he come busting in while we're
             chatting?
   
   Jackie takes a drag.
   
                       JACKIE
             He's already there.
   
                       MAX
             What if he hears something he's not
             supposed to?
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, we don't let that happen, now
             do we?
   
   
   EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds
   on the door.
   
   Ordell throws open the door.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck you doin' knockin on
             the door like the goddamn police? You
             lookin' to get shot?
   
                       MAX
             I thought you might be asleep.
   
                       ORDELL
             You keep fuckin' with me, you're
             gonna be asleep forever.
   
   He looks past Max.
   
                       MAX
             I'm alone.
   
                       ORDELL
             Git your ass in here.
   
   Max enters, Ordell slams the door.
   
   As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into
   his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.
   
                       ORDELL
             You better freeze, motherfucker!
   
   Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.
   
                       MAX
             You want your money? Your bond
             refund?
   
   He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills
   wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who
   catches it with his free hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's all?
   
                       MAX
             I have a bond receipt for you to
             sign.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
             about. You talk to her?
   
                       MAX
             She wants to give you your money. If
             she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
             ramming the door right now.
   
                       ORDELL
             How'd you find me?
   
                       MAX
             Winston found you.
   
                       ORDELL
             How the fuck did he find me?
   
                       MAX
             That's what Winston does. He finds
             people who don't want to be found.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, bully for that nigga. You say
             she wants to give me the money, huh?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, give it to me then.
   
                       MAX
             She wants to give it to you herself
             and collect her ten percent. She also
             wants to explain why she had to hold
             on to it.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'd like to hear that too. Turn
             around and put your hands on your
             head.
   
   Max does this, Ordell pats him down.
   
                       MAX
             Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
             already tried to get Jackie to go in
             with her, split the half million
             amongst themselves. What she did was
             take quite a risk to see you get your
             money.
   
                       ORDELL
             Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
   
                       MAX
             All I did was walk out with it.
   
                       ORDELL
             And you did that to protect my
             interest?
   
                       MAX
             In a way, yes.
   
                       ORDELL
             My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
             dumbass. Go sit over there on the
             couch.
   
   Max does.
   
                       MAX
             This place stinks.
   
                       ORDELL
             You get used to it after a while. Now
             tell me where my money's at.
   
                       MAX
             My office.
   
                       ORDELL
             And where's Jackie?
   
                       MAX
             She's been there since Thursday
             night.
   
                       ORDELL
             She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
             home?
   
                       MAX
             She was afraid.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (laughs)
             That I gotta see.
   
                       MAX
             She still is. She doesn't want to get
             shot before she can tell you what
             happened.
   
                       ORDELL
             Have her bring the money here.
   
                       MAX
             It's in the safe. She can't get at
             it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Call her, tell her the combination.
   
                       MAX
             I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
             She won't leave there till you have
             your money and you're gone.
   
                       ORDELL
             You expect me to just walk in there?
   
                       MAX
             If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
             in custody right now. When you said
             you'd name her as an accessory she
             believed you. That scares her more
             than anything.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's why she's givin' up my money
             huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
             I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
             knew how to handle her. She was my
             blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
             fuckin' told Louis he could've just
             given her a punch in the mouth, he
             didn't need to shoot her. She's at
             your office.
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             By herself. That big mandingo nigga
             Winston ain't there, is he?
   
                       MAX
             She's all alone.
   
                       ORDELL
             I call your office, she better answer
             the phone.
   
                       MAX
             She will.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Jackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's
   desk.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.
   
   She hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again...
   
   
   INT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   A STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a
   beeper "beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a
   dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a TV
   screen: Tom Snyder is interviewing a guest on his show
   ... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter-
   filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a
   sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his reclining chair.
   The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard
   offscreen.
   
   
   EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.
   
                       ORDELL
             All the time I've known her, I never
             heard her sound scared like that.
             Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
             I'm driving, gimme the keys.
   
   Max hands him the keys. They climb in.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to
   her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.
   
   
   INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
   
   Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays
   the radio, he likes the song and turns it up.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off
   the lights. The office goes dark. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
   slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat,
   sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
   Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
   illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a
   drag. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   His face is ice, the music is LOUD.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;
   
                       MAX
             It's the next street.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know where it is.
   
                       MAX
             Turn left.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know where to turn.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the
   window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and
   sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned
   off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             My money's in that office, right?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             She starts givin' me some bullshit
             about it ain't there. It's somewhere
             else and we can go get it.
                   (he holds up his Beretta)
             I'm shootin' you in the head right
             then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
             her in the kneecap, find out where my
             godamn money is. I go walkin' in
             there and that nigga Winston or
             anybody else is in there, you're the
             first man shot, understand what I'm
             sayin'?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, is there anything you want to
             tell me before we get out of this
             car?
   
                       MAX
             No.
   
                       ORDELL
             You sure?
   
                       MAX
             Yes.
   
                       ORDELL
             You better be, motherfucker.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
   in his pants.
   
                       ORDELL
             Get ahead of me and open the door.
   
   Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
   opens the door.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Step inside easy.
   
   Max does.
   
   Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
   
   Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
             in the goddamn dark for?
   
   Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
   bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
   light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
   out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
   
   Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
   Then Jackie says;
   
                       JACKIE
             Mark...
                   (raising her voice)
             ... he's got a gun!
   
   Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
   Beretta in his pants...
   
   ... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
   times in the chest...
   
   ... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
   lands at Max's feet.
   
   Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
   of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
   
   Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
   Ordell's body.
   
   Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
   looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
   over to the body.
   
   Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
   holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
   out of the bathroom.
   
                       DARGUS
             He's dead.
   
   Dargus looks up at Max;
   
                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
             Does he have the marked bills on him?
   
   Max still shaken;
   
                       MAX
             In his inside coat pocket.
   
   Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
   the forty-thousand marked dollars.
   
   Max looks at Jackie.
   
   She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
   just light up another Davidoff.
   
   Dargus looks up at Max;
   
                       DARGUS
             Why were you with him?
   
                       MAX
             I went to give him his refund, so he
             wouldn't have to come here.
   
                       DARGUS
             How'd you know where he was?
   
                       MAX
             I found out.
   
                       DARGUS
             And you didn't tell the Police?
   
                       MAX
             I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
             wanted him.
   
   Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.
   
                       JACKIE
             Remember when Ray said you hoped
             you'd get him before he got me?
   
   Dargus looks up and nods his head.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Well, you did. Thank you.
   
   She takes a drag on her Davidoff.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
   morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.
   
   A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TEN DAYS LATER"
   
   Max hears someone go;
   
                       JACKIE (O.S.)
             Knock knock.
   
   Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the
   doorway. She smiles at him.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Hey.
   
   MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Mark... he's got a gun!
   
   Dargus shoots Ordell, Ordell drops.
   
   
   BACK TO OFFICE
   
   Max smiles back.
   
                       MAX
             Hey, you.
   
   Jackie walks toward him.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got your package. It was fun
             getting a half-a-million dollars in
             the mail.
   
                       MAX
             Less ten percent.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
             out, since there wasn't no note.
   
   She sits in the chair in front of his desk.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
   
                       MAX
             I hesitated taking that much.
   
                       JACKIE
             You worked for it - if you're sure that's all
             you want.
   
                       MAX
             I'm sure.
   
   Pause between them.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm leaving, I have my things in my
             car. Why don't you walk out with me?
             I want to show you something.
   
   Max hesitates.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.
   
   He smiles and gets up from the desk.
   
   As she stands, Jackie says;
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he
             pissed he missed all the excitement.
   
                       MAX
             What's he doing?
   
                       JACKIE
             He's on to a new thing. He's after a
             guy who owns a gun shop he says is
             "woefully and wantonly" selling
             assault rifles to minors. He says
             he's gonna take him down if it's the
             last thing he does.
   
                       MAX
             Did you tell him you were leaving?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told him I might.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
   convertible.
   
                       MAX
             That's Ordell's.
   
                       JACKIE
             They've confiscated all his other
             stuff. But this one's sorta left
             over. The registration's in the glove
             box, the keys were under the seat...
             What's a matter" haven't you ever
             borrowed someone's car?
   
                       MAX
             Not after they're dead.
   
   She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
   at him across the black Mercedes.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't use you, Max.
   
                       MAX
             I didn't say you did.
   
                       JACKIE
             I never lied to you.
   
                       MAX
             I know.
   
                       JACKIE
             We're partners.
   
                       MAX
             I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't
             blame anybody for anything I do.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you blame yourself for helping me?
   
   He shakes his head 'no.'
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             'd feel a whole lot better if you
             took some more money.
   
                       MAX
                   (smiling)
             You'll get over that.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Where're you going?
   
                       JACKIE
             Spain.
   
                       MAX
             Madrid or Barcelona?
   
                       JACKIE
             Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
   
   He shakes his head 'no.'
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I hear they don't eat dinner till
             midnight.
   
   Max doesn't say anything.
   
                       JACKIE
             Wanna go?
   
                       MAX
             Thanks, but you have a good time.
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure I can't twist your arm?
   
                       MAX
             Thank you for saying that, but no. My
             business.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were tired of your
             business?
   
                       MAX
             I'm just tired in general.
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you scared of me?
   
   Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.
   
                       MAX
             A little bit.
   
   Jackie smiles back.
   
                       JACKIE
             Come over here.
   
   Max does.
   
   They give each other a long, tender kiss.
   
   She breaks it.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I'll send you a postcard, partner.

                         January, 1961 - President Dwight D. 
                         Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the 
                         Nation -

               EISENHOWER ADDRESS

                                     EISENHOWER
                         The conjunction of an immense military 
                         establishment and a large arms 
                         industry is new in the American 
                         experience.  The total influence - 
                         economic, political, even spiritual - 
                         is felt in every city, every 
                         statehouse, every office of the 
                         Federal Government... In the councils 
                         of government we must guard against 
                         the acquisition of unwarranted 
                         influence, whether sought or unsought, 
                         by the military industrial complex.
                         The potential for the disastrous 
                         rise of misplaced power exists and 
                         will persist... We must never let 
                         the weight of this combination 
                         endanger our liberties or democratic 
                         processes.  We should take nothing 
                         for granted...

               ELECTION IMAGERY

               School kids reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.  WPA films of 
               farmers harvesting the Texas plains.  Rain, thunderheads, a 
               dusty car coming from far away on a road moving towards 
               Dallas.  Cowboys round up the cattle.  Young marrieds in a 
               church.  Hillsides of tract homes going up.  The American 
               breadbasket, the West.  Over this we hear Eisenhower's 
               address.  As we move into the election campaign of 1960, we 
               see the TV debates, Nixon vs. Kennedy, Mayor Daley, Kennedy 
               victorious...

               Against this is juxtaposed other forces: segregation, J. 
               Edgar Hoover, military advisors, Castro, Marilyn Monroe, 
               Lumumba... three frames of the Zapruder film counter-cut... 
               ending with the Kennedy inauguration and the irony of Earl 
               Warren administering the oath as he will Kennedy's eulogy.

                         Kennedy of Massachusetts wins one of 
                         the narrowest election victories in 
                         American history over the Vice- 
                         President Richard Nixon by a little 
                         more than 100,000 votes.  Rumors 
                         abound that he stole the election in 
                         Illinois through the Democratic 
                         political machine of Mayor Daley...
                              (inauguration shots)
                         At his inauguration, at a time when 
                         American males all wore hats, he let 
                         his hair blow free in the wind.  
                         Alongside his beautiful and elegant 
                         wife of French origin, Jacqueline 
                         Bouvier, J.F.K. is the symbol of the 
                         new freedom of the 1960's, signifying 
                         change and upheaval to the American 
                         public, scaring many and hated 
                         passionately by some.  To win the 
                         election and to appease their fears, 
                         Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold 
                         War stance.

               BAY OF PIGS IMAGERY

               The beach, the bombardment, the rounding up of prisoners, 
               Kennedy's public apology, Allen Dulles standing next to 
               J.F.K., both uncomfortable with the small talk...

                         He inherits a secret war against the 
                         Communist Castro dictatorship in 
                         Cuba, a war run by the CIA and angry 
                         Cuban exiles out of bases in the 
                         Southern United States, Panama, 
                         Nicaragua and Guatemala.  Castro is 
                         a successful revolutionary frightening 
                         to American business interests in 
                         Latin America - companies like Cabot's 
                         United Fruit, Continental Can, and 
                         Rockefeller's Standard Oil.  This 
                         war culminates in the disastrous Bay 
                         of Pigs invasion in April 1961, when 
                         Kennedy refuses to provide air cover 
                         for the exile brigade.  Of the 1600 
                         men who invade, 114 are killed, 1200 
                         are captured.  The Cuban exiles and 
                         the CIA are furious at Kennedy's 
                         irresolution... Kennedy, taking public 
                         responsibility for the failure, 
                         privately claims the CIA lied to him 
                         and tried to manipulate him into 
                         ordering an all-out American invasion 
                         of Cuba.  He vows to splinter the 
                         CIA into a thousand pieces and fires 
                         Director Allen Dulles, Deputies 
                         Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell,

                         In October 1962, the world comes to 
                         the brink of nuclear war when Kennedy 
                         quarantines Cuba after announcing 
                         the presence of offensive Soviet 
                         nuclear missiles 90 miles off American 
                         shores.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
                         and the CIA call for an invasion.  
                         Kennedy refuses.  Soviet ships with 
                         more missiles sail towards the island, 
                         but at the last moment turn back.  
                         The world breathes with relief but 
                         backstage in Washington, rumors abound 
                         that J.F.K. has cut a secret deal 
                         with Russian Premier Khrushchev not 
                         to invade Cuba in return for a Russian 
                         withdrawal of missiles.  Suspicions 
                         abound that Kennedy is "soft on

                         In the ensuing months, Kennedy clamps 
                         down on Cuban exile activities, 
                         closing training camps, restricting 
                         covert operations, prohibiting 
                         shipment of weapons out of the 
                         country.  The covert arm of the CIA 
                         nevertheless continues its plan to 
                         assassinate Castor... In March '63, 
                         Kennedy announces drastic cuts in 
                         the defense budget.  In November 
                         1963, he orders the withdrawal by 
                         Christmas of the first 1000 troops 
                         of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam.  
                         He tells several of his intimates 
                         that he will withdraw all Vietnam 
                         troops after the '64 election, saying 
                         to the Assistant Secretary of State, 
                         Roger Hilsman, "The Bay of Pigs has 
                         taught me one, not to trust generals 
                         or the CIA, and two, that if the 
                         American people do not want to use 
                         American troops to remove a Communist

                         can I ask them to use troops to remove 
                         a Communist regime 9,000 miles 
                         away?"... Finally, in August 1963, 
                         over the objections of the Joint 
                         Chiefs of Staff, the United States,

                         sign a treaty banning nuclear bomb 
                         tests in the atmosphere, underwater 
                         and in space...  Early that fateful 
                         summer, Kennedy speaks of his new 
                         vision at American University in 
                         Washington.

                         What kind of peace do we seek?  Not 
                         a pax Americana enforced on the world 
                         by American weapons of war... We 
                         must re-examine our own attitudes 
                         towards the Soviet Union... If we 
                         cannot now end our differences at 
                         least we can help make the world 
                         safe for diversity.  For, in the 
                         final analysis, our most basic link 
                         is that we all inhabit this small 
                         planet.  We all breathe the same 
                         air.  We all cherish our children's 
                         future.  And we are all mortal...

               CONCLUDING KENNEDY IMAGERY

               Diplomats at the United Nations... Adlai Stevenson, Castor... 
               Martin Luther King and the March on Washington (a snatch of 
               his "I Have a Dream" speech)... Bobby Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa 
               going at it... U.S.  Steel Chairman's remarks in the steel 
               face-off, men going to courtrooms with briefcases,... Teddy 
               Kennedy, Rose, Joe, the Kennedy family, all teeth and good 
               looks... and of course John campaigning, always campaigning, 
               shaking hands, smiling, that supremely warm smile and sense 
               of grace and ability to convey to crowds their oneness with 
               him... forever... culminating in the more specific Texas 
               shots... with Jackie in San Antonio, and Houston... then at 
               Fort Worth... then at Love Field moving through the clouds 
               toward the Dallas/Forth Worth plain which suddenly breaks 
               into view as we descend...

               LOUISIANA HIGHWAY - DAY (1963)

               A moving car carrying two Cuban males disgorges a rumpled, 
               screaming woman, Rose Cheramie, a whore in her thirties, 
               lying there bleeding in the dirt.  The car drives off.

               HOSPITAL - DAY (1963)

               We see Rose, badly cut but quite lucid, trying to reason 
               with a policeman, Lt. Fruge, and a doctor - in a remote black-
               and-white documentary.

                                     ROSE
                         They're going up to Dallas... to 
                         whack Kennedy.  Friday the 22nd, 
                         that's when they're going to do it.  
                         In Dealey Plaza.  They're gonna whack 
                         him!  You gotta call somebody, these 
                         are serious fuckin' guys.

                         like this since she came in.

               BACK TO DOCUMENTARY IMAGES

               We see the last close-ups of Kennedy shaking hands on the 
               tarmac at Love Field, smiling, into the motorcade... the 
               downtown streets of Dallas, people packing the sidewalks 
               clear back to the buildings, hanging out of windows ten 
               stories up, schoolgirls surging out into the street in front 
               of the car.  The President is wildly popular - except for 
               the occasional posters calling for his arrest for treason...

                                     VOICE 7
                         More rumors emerge of J.F.K.'s 
                         backdoor efforts outside usual State 
                         Department and CIA channels to 
                         establish dialogue with Fidel Castro 
                         through contacts at the United Nations 
                         in New York.  Kennedy is seeking 
                         change on all fronts.  Bitter battles 
                         are fought with Southern 
                         segregationists to get James Meredith 
                         into the University of Mississippi.  
                         Three months after Kennedy submits a 
                         sweeping civil rights bill to 
                         Congress, Martin Luther King leads 
                         250,000 in a march on Washington.  
                         Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General, 
                         for the first time ever vigorously 
                         prosecutes the Mafia in American 
                         life, bringing and winning a record 
                         number of cases - 288 convictions of 
                         organized crime figures including 13 
                         grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and 
                         his Teamsters Union.  The President 
                         also takes on Big Business, forcing 
                         back steel prices, winning 45 of 46 
                         antitrust cases during 1963 and he 
                         wants to help everyday taxpayers by 
                         ending age- old business privileges 
                         like the oil depletion allowance and 
                         the fees paid to the Federal Reserve 
                         Bank for printing America's currency.
                         Revolutionary changes are foreseen 
                         after J.F.K.'s assumed re-election 
                         in 1964.  Foremost in the political 
                         consciousness of the country is the 
                         possibility of a Kennedy dynasty.  
                         Robert Kennedy in '68, Teddy Kennedy 
                         in '76.  In November, 1963 John 
                         Kennedy travels to Texas, his 
                         popularity sagging to 59% largely 
                         due to his civil rights stand for 
                         which he is particularly hated in 
                         the South.  Texas is a crucial state
                         for him to carry in '64.  With him 
                         is Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson 
                         and Texas Governor John Connally.  
                         On November 21, they visit Houston 
                         and San Antonio.  On the morning of 
                         November 22, he speaks in Fort Worth, 
                         then flies 15 minutes to Love Field 
                         in Dallas, where he takes a motorcade 
                         through downtown Dallas on his way 
                         to speak at 12:30 at the International 
                         Trade Mart.  Later, the motorcade 
                         takes him through Dealey Plaza at 
                         12:30...

               DEALEY PLAZA - THAT DAY (NOV. 22, 1963)

               We see a massive overhead shot of the Plaza as it lay then.  
               Credits conclude under shot - and we have the subtitle 
               "November 22, 1963."

               A young epileptic screams and suddenly collapses near the 
               fountains in front of the Texas School Depository.  He has a 
               violent epileptic fit that attracts surrounding attention.  
               Dallas policemen run over to him.  We hear the siren of an 
               ambulance roaring up.

               TIMECUT TO ambulance loading the epileptic man and taking 
               off.

                                     AMBULANCE VOICE
                         We are en route to Parkland.

               BACK TO a montage of the shooting.  We see Kennedy, in the 
               last seconds, waving, turning the corner at Houston from 
               Main... We see TV footage and a piece of Zapruder film from 
               before the shooting; fragmented images...

               CUT TO stages shots of crowd people looking on.  The images 
               are grainy to match the tone of the Zapruder film.  People 
               are on rooftops, hollering.  The crowd is wild with 
               enthusiasm.  We pan past Jack Ruby and slam into him in black-
               and-white.  The camera shows a Cuban man with a radio; a man 
               with an umbrella; subliminals.  Through open windows on the 
               fifth floor of the Criminal Courts Building, convicts watch 
               and holler from their jail cells.  We see the sixth floor of 
               the Texas Book Depository with open windows and a vague blur 
               of a figure and a rifle.

               The clock on the Hertz sign reads 12:30.

                                     VOICE
                         We'll be there in about five minutes.

               A motorcycle officer paralleling the Kennedy car tries to 
               use his radio.

               It's jammed.  The sound of the jammed Dictabelt drives the 
               rest of the sequence.

               We see Zapruder, a short middle - aged man, shooting his 8mm 
               film from the Grassy Knoll, and then we see Jackie Kennedy - 
               floating on film, her voice, high, soft:

                                     JACKIE KENNEDY
                              (voice restaged)
                         And in the motorcade, you know I 
                         usually would be waving mostly to 
                         the left side and he was waving mostly 
                         to the right, which is one reason 
                         you're not looking at each other 
                         very much.  And it was terribly hot.  
                         Just blinding all of us... We could 
                         see a tunnel in front of us.  
                         Everything was really slow then.  
                         And I remember thinking it would be 
                         so cool under that tunnel.

               The camera rests on Jackie for a beat, and then we see the 
               shot of the little schoolgirl skipping on the grass.

               CUT TO the approaching overpass.  J.F.K. waves... Mrs. 
               Connally turns to J.F.K.  The shot is crazy, fractured, 
               surreal.

                                     MRS. CONNALLY (V.O.)
                         Mr. President, you can't say that 
                         Dallas doesn't love you.

                                     JFK (V.O.)
                         No, you certainly can't.

               Then we hear the shots: the volley sounds like a motorcycle 
               backfire.  We catch a glimpse of a muzzle flash and smoke.  
               We see a view from the street of the Texas School Book 
               Depository - all in line with the "official" version of 
               events.  Pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof.  
               Then the screen goes gray as did CBS TV's first bulletins to 
               the country.

                                     CBS BULLETIN

                         We interrupt this program to bring 
                         you this flash bulletin.  A burst of 
                         gunfire!  Three bursts of gunfire, 
                         apparently from automatic weapons, 
                         were fired at President Kennedy's 
                         motorcade in downtown Dallas.

               We hear voices under this from everywhere, colliding in 
               confusion and horror:

                         be all right.  LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.  
                         WE'RE HIT!  LAWSON, THIS IS KELLERMAN.

                         Oh, no, they've shot Jack... I love 
                         you, Jack... Jack... they've killed

                                     CBS BULLETIN (V.O.)
                         The first reports say that President 
                         Kennedy has been seriously wounded 
                         by the shooting.  More details just 
                         arrived.  United Press say the wounds 
                         to President Kennedy perhaps could 
                         be fatal.  Repeating: President 
                         Kennedy has been shot by a would-be 
                         assassin in Dallas.  Three bursts of 
                         gunfire, apparently from automatic 
                         weapons...

                         AREA BEHIND THE FENCE.  IT'S THAT 
                         BUILDING UP THERE.

               We hear sirens and screeching tires.  The screen is still 
               gray, randomly intercut with the end of the Nix film showing 
               the car escaping.  There are wildly tracking shots of the 
               crowd running towards the Grassy Knoll.

               The camera pans up the little set of stairs.  We see more 
               faces.

               Someone in a suit stops our camera.  Secret Service?

               We see the briefest glimpse from the Zapruder film.  The 
               camera moves in on the open umbrella next, then to the freeway 
               sign, then to Mrs. Kennedy out of the car reaching for help, 
               then to the agent rushing onto the rear fender.  The car 
               finally speeds away.  The people on the other side of the 
               underpass wave at the oncoming hearse from hell.  (These are 
               fragmented, mystifying shots.  The main effect is one of 
               blackout - of not knowing; of being in the dark, as we all 
               were back then.)

               CUT TO JIM GARRISON'S OFFICE - NEW ORLEANS - SAME DAY (1963)

               Pause.  The lovely old china clock on the wall reads 12:35.  
               Somewhere a car backfires.  We see a close-up of the clock 
               moving to 12:36.  We hear the sound of a pen on paper, 
               scratching... We see a shot of Jim Garrison as a young air 
               pilot in World War II; hear the sound of airplanes.  The 
               camera moves to framed photos of Jim as a young, Lincolnesque 
               lawyer... we hear sounds of political rallies, cheering... a 
               shot of Jim's grandfather shaking hands with President William 
               Taft.  The sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of Jim 
               staring at piles of decaying corpses at Dachau... a photo of 
               Clarence Darrow... a law degree and an appointment as District 
               Attorney of the New Orleans Parish... Mother Garrison with 
               young Jim on the desk... another family - his own.  We look 
               across the thick desk with the chess set, A Complete

               Works of William Shakespeare and a Nazi helmet with a bullet 
               hole in it... to Jim himself writing - pen to paper.  We 
               sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man.  The clock 
               ticks in the awful suspended silence.

               It's as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent 
               room.  This is the last moment of peace before the World 
               will rush through the door in all its sound and fury - to 
               change his life forever.  The camera haywires into a close-
               up of Jim as he looks up... and knows.

               Lou Ivon, Jim's chief investigator, is already standing there 
               in the room.  He is burly, in his 30s - his expression 
               universal for that day.

                                     JIM
                         What's wrong, Lou?

                                     LOU
                         Boss, the President's been shot.  In 
                         Dallas.  Five minutes ago.

               Jim is stunned.  His look of horror and shock speaks the 
               same language as on faces all across America that Black 
               Friday.

                                     JIM
                         Oh no!... How bad?

                                     LOU
                         No word yet.  But they think it's in 
                         the head.

               Jim gets up, heading rapidly for the door.

                                     JIM
                         Come on.  Napoleon's has a TV set.

               NAPOLEON'S RESTAURANT - THE QUARTER - DAY(1963)

               The midday customers all stare solemnly at the TV set high 
               in the corner of the cafe.  The manager, ashen, serves drinks 
               to Jim and Lou.

                         Apparently three bullets were found.  
                         Governor Connally also appeared to 
                         be hit.  The President was rushed by 
                         the Secret Service to Parkland 
                         Memorial Hospital four miles from 
                         Dealey Plaza.

               We are told a bullet entered the base of the throat and came 
               out of the backside, but there is no confirmation, blood 
               transfusions are being given, a priest has administered the 
               last rites.

                                     JIM
                         There's still a chance, dammit!  
                         Come on, Jack - pull through.

                         I don't believe it.  I don't believe 
                         it.  Here, in this country.

               They all look up, expectant, as Walter Cronkite interrupts 
               on the TV:

                              (choked pause)
                         Vice-President Johnson has left the 
                         hospital in Dallas, but we do not 
                         know to where he has proceeded.  
                         Presumably, he will be taking the 
                         oath of office shortly, and become 
                         the 36th President of the United 
                         States.

               There are sounds of shock, muttering, some sobbing in the 
               restaurant.  Lou gulps down his drink.  Jim sits stunned.

                                     JIM
                         I didn't always agree with him - too 
                         liberal for my tastes - but I 
                         respected him.  He had style... God, 
                         I'm ashamed to be an American today.

               He holds back the tears.  The food comes.  Lou waves it off.  
               They just sit there.

               Katzenjammer's is an Irish working class bar across Canal 
               St. In a seedy area near the Mississippi River, just off 
               Lafayette Square.

               A variety of loud Irish working men sit on stools watching 
               the TV.  There are a few formica tables with chairs against 
               the walls, and an unused pool table.

                         Many arrests have been made here 
                         today.  Anyone looking even remotely 
                         suspicious is being detained.  Most 
                         of the crowd has gone home but there 
                         are still many stunned people 
                         wandering around in Dealey Plaza 
                         unable to comprehend what happened 
                         here earlier today.

               On the TV, we see the scene at Dealey Plaza.  The reporter 
               has several men, women, and children gathered around him.  
               He puts his microphone in their faces.

                         this country, for colored people.  
                         Why?

                         I grabbed my kids and wife and hit 
                         the ground.  The bullets were coming 
                         over our heads - from that fence 
                         back on the knoll - I was just so 
                         shaken.  I saw his face when it hit... 
                         he just, his ear flew off, he turned 
                         just real white and then went stiff 
                         like a board and flopped over on his 
                         stomach, with his foot sticking out.

               Back in the bar, the camera moves to two patrons seated at a 
               table by themselves, far enough away not to be heard.  Guy 
               Banister is a sturdy, imposing ex - FBI agent in his 60's, 
               steel gray hair, blue eyes, ruddy from heavy drinking.  He 
               wears a small rosebud in his lapel.  Jack Martin is a thin, 
               mousy man in his mid - 50's, wearing a Dick Tracy hat.

               They're both drinking Wild Turkey heavily.  The TV blares 
               loudly across the room over their voices.

                                     BANISTER
                         All this blubbering over that 
                         sonofabitch!  They're grieving like 
                         they knew the man.  It makes me want 
                         to puke.

                         God's sake, chief.  The President 
                         was shot.

                                     BANISTER
                         A bullshit President!  I don't see 
                         any weeping for all the thousands of 
                         Cubans that bastard condemned to 
                         death and torture at the Bay of Pigs.  
                         Where are all the tears for the 
                         Russians and Hungarians and Chinese 
                         living like slaves in prison camps 
                         run by Kennedy's communist buddies - 
                         All these damned peace treaties!  
                         I'm telling ya Jack, that's what 
                         happens when you let the niggers 
                         vote.  They get together with the 
                         Jews and the Catholics and elect an 
                         Irish bleeding heart.

                                     MARTIN
                         Chief, maybe you had a little too 
                         much to drink.

                         in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.

               NAPOLEON'S RESTAURANT - DAY(1963)

               Several hours have elapsed.  The clientele has grown, 
               drinking, watching the tube with the insatiable curiosity 
               the event engendered.  People stare in from the street... 
               There is a silence in the restaurant.

                         Carcano Italian rifle, a powerful 
                         World War II military gun used by 
                         infantry and highly accurate at 
                         distances of 100 yards.

               We see images of the textbook boxes - the sniper's nest in 
               the sixth story of the Book Depository - and then the view 
               out the window looking down at Elm Street.

                         A flash bulletin... the Dallas Police 
                         have just announced they have a 
                         suspect in the killing of a Dallas 
                         police officer, J.D. Tippit, who was 
                         shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff, a suburb 
                         of Dallas.

               Police are saying there could be a tie - in here to the murder

                         The suspect, identified as Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald, was arrested by more than a 
                         dozen police officers after a short 
                         scuffle at the Texas movie theatre 
                         in Oak Cliff, several blocks from 
                         where Officer Tippit was killed, 
                         apparently with a .38 revolver found 
                         on Oswald.  There is apparently at 
                         least one eyewitness.

               TELEVISION INSERT:  Oswald is booked at the station.  A surly 
               young man, 24, he claims to the press:

                                     TV OSWALD
                         No, I don't know what I'm charged 
                         with... I don't know what dispatches 
                         you people have been given, but I 
                         emphatically deny these charges.

                         They oughta just shoot the bastard.

               The room bursts out with an accumulated fury at the young 
               Oswald - a tremendous release of tension.  On the TV we see 
               the excitement in the newsmen's eyes; they all sense that 
               this is the break they're looking for in the case.

               Garrison and Ivon watch the TV, and then Garrison stands and 
               pays the bill.

                         too much stuff like this in the war.

               As they leave, the camera holds on the image of Oswald.

               The sun is setting through thunderheads over the Mississippi 
               River waterfront as Banister and Martin wobble out, drunk, 
               down the street.

                                     BANISTER
                         Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?
                              (Martin says nothing, 
                              looks troubled)
                         I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just 
                         did this crazy thing before anyone 
                         could stop him, right?

                                     MARTIN
                         I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I 
                         gotta get home.

                                     BANISTER
                              (strong-arms Martin)
                         Get home my ass.  We're going to the 
                         office, have another drink.  I want 
                         some company tonight.

               BANISTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT(1963)

               Rain pours down outside 531 Lafayette Street as Banister 
               opens several locks on the door and turns on the lights.  
               The frosted glass on the door says "W. Guy Banister 
               Associates, Inc., Investigators."  It's a typical detective's 
               office with spare desks, simple chairs, large filing cabinets 
               and cubicles in the rear.

                                     BANISTER
                              (repetitive)
                         Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald 
                         kid would pull off a stunt like an 
                         assassination?
                              (Martin waits)
                         Just goes to show, you can never 
                         know about some people.  Am I right, 
                         Jack?
                              (Martin, frightened 
                              now, doesn't reply)
                         Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are 
                         as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't 
                         tell me we have another bleeding 
                         heart here.  Hell, all these years I 
                         thought you were on my side.

                                     MARTIN
                         Chief, sometimes I don't know whether 
                         you're kidding or not.

                                     BANISTER
                         I couldn't be more serious, Jack.  
                         Those big red eyes have me wondering 
                         about your loyalty.

               Banister, going to a file cabinet to get a bottle out, notices 
               one of the file drawers is slightly ajar.  He flies into a 
               rage.

                                     BANISTER
                         Who the hell opened my files!  You've 
                         been looking through my private files, 
                         haven't you, you weasel?

                                     MARTIN
                         You may not like this, chief, but 
                         you're beginning to act paranoid.  I 
                         mean, you really are.

                                     BANISTER
                         You found out about Dave Ferrie going 
                         to Texas today and you went through 
                         all my files to see what was going 
                         on.  You're a goddamn spy.

                                     MARTIN
                              (angry)
                         Goddammit chief, why would I ever 
                         need to look in your files?  I saw 
                         enough here this summer to write a 
                         book.

                                     BANISTER
                         I always lock my files.  And you 
                         were the only one here today...
                              (stops as he hears 
                              Martin)
                         What do you mean, you son of a bitch?

                                     MARTIN
                         You know what I mean.  I saw a lot 
                         of strange things going on in this 
                         office this summer.  And a lotta 
                         strange people.

               Enraged, Banister pulls a .357 Magnum from his holster, 
               cursing as he suddenly slams it into Martin's temple.  The 
               smaller man crumples painfully to the ground.

                                     BANISTER
                         You didn't see a goddamn thing, you 
                         little weasel.  Do you get it?  You 
                         didn't see a goddamn thing.

               JIM GARRISON'S HOME - THAT NIGHT(1963)

               Jim and his wife, Liz, watch the television.  She is in her 
               early 30's, an attractive, quiet southern woman from 
               Louisiana.  They live in a spacious two-story wood house, 
               suburban in feel.

               TELEVISION IMAGE: Reporters are jammed in the Assembly Room 
               of the Dallas Police Headquarters as Oswald is brought through 
               the corridor, officers on either side of him.

                              (over the din)
                         Did you shoot the President?

                                     TV OSWALD
                         I didn't shoot anybody, no sir.  I'm 
                         just a patsy.

               The camera moves onto Jim with Liz and the children - Jasper, 
               the oldest at 4, holds his dad's hand.  On Liz's lap, Snapper, 
               the youngest, is asleep.  Virginia, the 2-year-old, is 
               pestering the Boxer dog... and Mattie, the heavyset black 
               housekeeper, 35, is in tears.

                                     LIZ
                         My god, he sure looks like a creep.  
                         What's he talkin' 'bout... a patsy?

                         Well, I was questioned by a judge.  
                         However, I protested at the time 
                         that I was not allowed legal 
                         representation during that very short 
                         and sweet hearing.  Uh, I really 
                         don't know what the situation is 
                         about.  Nobody has told me anything 
                         except that I am accused of, uh, 
                         murdering a policeman.  I know nothing 
                         more than that and I do request that 
                         someone come forward to give me, uh, 
                         legal assistance.

                         Did you kill the President?

                                     TV OSWALD
                         No.  I have not been charged with 
                         that.  In fact nobody has said that 
                         to me yet.  The first thing I heard 
                         about it was when the newspaper 
                         reporters in the hall, uh, asked me 
                         that question.

                                     NEWSMAN 6
                         You have been charged.

                                     TV OSWALD
                         Sir?

                                     NEWSMAN 6
                         You have been charged.

               Oswald seems shocked.

                                     NEWSMAN 5
                         Were you ever in the Free Cuba 
                         Movement or whatever the...

                              (a voice in the back)
                         It was the Fair Play for Cuba 
                         Committee.

               Oswald looks over and spots Ruby in the back of the room, on 
               a table.  Recognition is in his eyes.  The police start to 
               move him out.

                                     NEWSMAN 6
                         What did you do in Russia?  What 
                         happened to your eye?

                                     TV OSWALD
                         A policeman hit me.

                         He seems pretty cool to me for a man 
                         under pressure like that.

                                     LIZ
                         Icy, you mean.
                              (shudders)
                         He gives me the willies... come on 
                         sugarplums, it's past your bedtimes...
                              (to Jim)
                         Come on, let's go upstairs.
                              (rises)
                         Mattie - get ahold of yourself.

                                     MATTIE
                         Why, Mr. Jim?  He was a great man, 
                         Mr. Jim, a great man...

               Jim is moved by her.

                         There is no one else but him.  He 
                         has been charged in the Supreme Court 
                         with murder with malice.  We're gonna 
                         ask for the death penalty.

               Jim moves to the phone as Liz starts the kids up the stairs.  
               The TV cuts to stills of Oswald's life.  Two newsmen sit in 
               a studio, smoking, sharing information.

                                     FRANK
                              (Newsman 7)
                         So several hours after the 
                         assassination, a disturbed portrait 
                         is emerging of Lee Harvey Oswald.  
                         Described as shy and introverted, he 
                         spent much of his childhood in New 
                         Orleans, Louisiana and went to high 
                         school there.  After a stint in the 
                         Marines, he apparently became 
                         fascinated by Communism and in 1959 
                         defected to the Soviet Union.

                              (Newsman 8)
                         He married a Russian woman there, 
                         Frank, had a child, and then returned 
                         to the United States after 30 months.  
                         But he is still believed to be a 
                         dedicated Marxist and a fanatical 
                         supporter of Fidel Castro and ultra 
                         left wing causes.  He spent last 
                         summer in New Orleans and was arrested 
                         in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban 
                         exiles.

                         And apparently, Bob, Oswald had been 
                         passing out pro-Castro pamphlets for 
                         an organization called Fair Play for 
                         Cuba, a Communist front he reportedly 
                         belongs to.

                         born wife, who has identified the 
                         rifle found in the Book Depository

               conference table with a black-and-white portable TV on a 
               side table showing the current Sunday, November 24 news from 
               Dallas.

                         Lee good man... he not shoot anyone.

               Camera moves to Lou Ivon, looking at paperwork.

                         As far as Oswald's associates, boss, 
                         the one name that keeps popping up 
                         is David Ferrie.

               Oswald was seen with him several times last summer.

                                     JIM
                         I know David - a strange character.

                         He's been in trouble before.  Used 
                         to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern 
                         Airlines, but he got canned after an 
                         alleged homosexual incident with a 
                         14-year old boy.

                         Get Kohlman... he told somebody the 
                         Texas trip... yesterday mentioned to 
                         somebody about Ferrie... find it 
                         out.

               On the TV we see the first image of the "backyard photos" of 
               Lee Harvey Oswald holding the rifle.

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         These backyard photos were found 
                         yesterday among Oswald's possessions 
                         in the garage of Janet William's 
                         home in Riving, Texas, where Marina 
                         Oswald and her children are living.  
                         The picture apparently was taken 
                         earlier this year.  Police say the 
                         rifle, a cheap World War II Italian-
                         made Mannlicher-Carcano, was ordered 
                         from a Chicago mailing house and 
                         shipped to Oswald's alias A. Hidell 
                         at a post office box in March, 1963.  
                         This is the same rifle that was used 
                         to assassinate the President.

               The camera moves back to the staff, who watch, obviously 
               influenced.

                                     COX
                         That ties it up...

                                     NUMA
                         Another nut.  Jesus, anybody can get 
                         a rifle in Texas.

                              (hangs up)
                         So it seems that Dave Ferrie drove 
                         off on a Friday afternoon for Texas - 
                         a source told Kohlman he might have 
                         been a getaway pilot for Oswald.

               Members of the team exchange looks of surprise and disbelief.

                                     JIM
                         Hold your horses.  What kinda source?

                         I think I remember this guy Ferrie 
                         speaking at a meeting of some 
                         veteran's group.  Ranting against 
                         Castro.  Extreme stuff.

                         We go back now to the basement of 
                         police headquarters where they're 
                         about to transfer Oswald to County 
                         Prison...

               TELEVISION IMAGE: The basement of the Dallas police 
               headquarters - waiting.  Men mill around as Oswald is led 
               out of the basement by two deputies.  Jack Ruby rushes forward 
               out of the crowd - and into history - putting his sealing 
               bullet into Oswald.  Total chaos erupts...

               The camera is on the staff, looking.  We hear gasps.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         He's been shot!  Oswald's been shot!

                         that... I don't believe this... Right 
                         on TV!  What is going on?  Who is 
                         this guy... oh Jesus.

               Jim is silent.

                                     LOU
                         Seventy cops in that basement.  What 
                         the hell were they doing?

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         Jack Ruby... Who is Jack Ruby?  Oswald 
                         is hurt.

               We see images of Oswald being lifted onto the stretcher, 
               into the ambulance, and the newscaster crouching, whispering.  
               Everybody in the room is stunned still.

                                     LOU
                         Well, no trial now.  Looks like 
                         somebody saved the Dallas D.A. a 
                         pile of work.

               They look to Jim.  There's a pause.  He is deeply disturbed.

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         Well, let's get Ferrie in here anyway.

               GARRISON OFFICE - NEXT DAY - DAY(1963)

               The portable television plays to Jim alone, sitting in his 
               chair smoking a pipe.  We see searing images of the funeral - 
               crowds of mourners, the casket being driven through the 
               streets, the honor guards, the horses, the dignitaries walking 
               behind, Jackie veiled... the faces of De Gaulle, MacMillan, 
               Robert Kennedy.  We intercut briefly to Lyndon Johnson sitting 
               down earlier that day with the Joint Chiefs of Staff... and 
               then a future cut to Johnson in the Oval Office (staged).  
               The shots are very tight, uncomfortable - noses, eyes, hands - 
               very tight.

               As the door opens following a knock, David Ferrie is brought 
               into Jim's office by two police officers and Lou Ivon.  Jim 
               stands up, cordial.

                                     LOU
                         Chief... David Ferrie.

               Ferrie suffers from alopecia, a disease that has removed all 
               his body hair, and he looks like a Halloween character - 
               penciled eyebrows, one higher than the other, a scruffy 
               reddish wig pasted on askew with glue, thrift store clothing.  
               His eyes, however, are swift and cunning, his smile warm, 
               inviting itself, his demeanor hungry to please.

                                     JIM
                              (shakes hands)
                         Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make 
                         yourself comfortable.  Coffee?

                                     FERRIE
                         Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I 
                         met you on Carondolet Street right 
                         after your election.  I congratulated 
                         you, remember?

                                     JIM
                         How could I forget?  You make quite 
                         a first impression.
                              (on intercom)
                         Sharon, could you please bring us 
                         some coffee?
                              (Ferrie laughs; pause)
                         I've heard over the years you're 
                         quite a first-rate pilot, Dave.  
                         Legend has it you can get in and out 
                         of any field, no matter how small...
                              (Jim points to the 
                              pictures on his wall)
                         I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you 
                         know.  Flew grasshoppers for the 
                         field artillery in the war.

               Ferrie glimpses the low-volumed TV - and images of the 
               funeral.  He looks away, jittery, and takes out a cigarette.  
               Sharon brings the coffee in.

                                     FERRIE
                         Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?

                              (holds up his pipe)
                         How could I?  Dave, as you know, 
                         President Kennedy was assassinated 
                         on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald was arrested as a suspect and 
                         then was murdered yesterday by a man 
                         named Jack Ruby.
                              (on each name, watching 
                              Ferrie's reaction)
                         We've heard reports that Oswald spent 
                         the summer in New Orleans and we've 
                         been advised you knew Oswald pretty 
                         well.

                                     FERRIE
                         That's not true.  I never met anybody 
                         named Oswald.  Anybody who told you 
                         that has to be crazy.

                                     JIM
                         But you are aware, he served in your 
                         Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a 
                         teenager.

                                     FERRIE
                         No... if he did, I don't remember 
                         him.  There were lots of kids in and 
                         out... y'know.

                                     JIM

                              newspaper)
                         I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps 
                         you knew this man under another name?

                                     FERRIE
                         No, I never saw him before in my 
                         life.

                         Well that must've been mistaken 
                         information we got.  Thanks for 
                         straightening it out for us.

                              looks relieved; images 
                              of the funeral 
                              continue on the TV)
                         There is one other matter that's 
                         come up, Dave.  We were told you 
                         took a trip to Texas shortly after 
                         the assassination of Friday.

                                     FERRIE
                         Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to 
                         Houston.

                                     JIM
                         What was so appealing about Houston?

                         I hadn't been there ice skating in 
                         many years, and I had a couple of 
                         young friends with me, and we decided 
                         we wanted to go ice skating.

                                     JIM
                         Dave, may I ask why the urge to go 
                         ice skating in Texas happened to 
                         strike you during one of the most 
                         violent thunderstorms in recent 
                         memory?

                                     FERRIE
                         Oh, it was just a spur of the moment 
                         thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.

                                     JIM
                         I see.  And where did you drive?

                         We went straight to Houston, and 
                         then Saturday night we drove to 
                         Galveston and stayed over there.

                                     JIM
                         Why Galveston?

                         No particular reason.  Just to go 
                         somewhere.

                                     JIM

                         In the morning we went goose hunting.  
                         Then headed home, but I dropped the 
                         boys off to see some relatives and I 
                         stayed in Hammond.

                                     JIM
                         Did you bag any geese on this trip?

                                     FERRIE
                         I believe the boys got a couple.

                                     JIM
                         But the boys told us they didn't get 
                         any.

                                     FERRIE
                              (fidgeting, lighting 
                              another cigarette)
                         Oh yes, well, come to think of it, 
                         they're right.  We got to where the 
                         geese were and there were thousands 
                         of them.  But you couldn't approach 
                         them.  They were a wise bunch of 
                         birds.

                                     JIM
                         Your young friends also told us you 
                         had no weapons in the car.  Dave, 
                         isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for 
                         geese without a shotgun?

                                     FERRIE
                         Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison.  
                         I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got 
                         out there near the geese and it was 
                         only then we realized we'd forgotten 
                         our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of 
                         course we didn't get any geese.

                                     JIM
                         I see.
                              (stands up)
                         Dave thank you for your time.  I'm 
                         sorry it has to end inconveniently 
                         for you, but I'm going to have you 
                         detained for further questioning by 
                         the FBI.

                                     FERRIE
                              (shaken)
                         Why?  What's wrong?

                                     JIM
                         Dave, I find your story simply not 
                         believable.

               Lou and the two cops escort Ferrie out of the office as Jim 
               turns to the television image of Kennedy's final moments of 
               rest.  The bugler plays taps.  John Jr., 3 years old, in an 
               image which will become famous, salutes his Dad farewell.  
               The riderless horse stands lonely against the Washington 
               sky.

               FBI OFFICE - NEW ORLEANS - NEXT DAY(1963)

               At a small press conference, the FBI spokesman reads a 
               statement.

                                     FBI SPOKESMAN
                         Gentlemen, this afternoon the FBI 
                         released David W. Ferrie of New 
                         Orleans.  After extensive questioning 
                         and a thorough background check, the 
                         Bureau found no evidence that...

               television.  Lou, Broussard, Numa and Jim watch.

                              (on TV)
                         ...Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald 
                         or that he has had any connection 
                         with the assassination of President 
                         Kennedy.  The Special Agent in Charge 
                         would like to make clear that Mr. 
                         Ferrie was brought in for questioning 
                         by the District Attorney of Orleans 
                         parish, not by the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation.  The Bureau regrets 
                         any trouble this may have caused Mr. 
                         Ferrie...

                         In national news, President Johnson 
                         has announced the creation of a blue 
                         ribbon presidential commission to 
                         probe the events in Dallas.

               Lou looks at Jim, angry.

                                     LOU
                         Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought 
                         we were on the same side.  What the 
                         hell business is it of theirs to say 
                         that?

                         Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way 
                         they let him go.

                                     JIM
                         They must know something we don't.
                              (dismisses it)
                         So, let's get on with our lives, 
                         gentlemen... we got plenty of home 
                         grown crimes to prosecute.

               He reaches to turn off the TV and get back to work.  The 
               last image on the TV is:

                         Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and is

               Jim flicks the TV off as the overture ends.

               AERIAL SHOT - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY(1966)

               We look down at the White House from the plane's point of 
               view.  A subtitle reads: "THREE YEARS LATER."

               INTERIOR OF PLANE

                                     SENATOR RUSSELL LONG
                              (looking out the window)
                         That's a mess down there, Jim.  We've 
                         bitten off more "Vietnam" that we 
                         can possibly chew.

               Jim, now 46, reads the front page of THE WASHINGTON POST 
               which details the latest battle in Vietnam.  He sits next to 
               Senator Long from Louisiana, in his 50's, who's drinking a 
               whiskey.  They're on a crowded businessman's shuttle.  We 
               see a close-up of a newspaper article about the Vietnam war: 
               "more troops asked by Westmoreland."

                                     LONG
                              (continuing)
                         Sad thing is the way it's screwing 
                         up this country, all these hippies 
                         running around on drugs, the way 
                         young people look you can't tell a 
                         boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a 
                         girl the other day, she was pregnant - 
                         you could see her whole belly, and 
                         you know what she painted on it?  
                         "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa 
                         control.  Values've gone to hell, 
                         Jim... Course it figures when you 
                         got somebody like that polecat Johnson 
                         in the White House.

                                     JIM
                         I sometimes feel things've gone 
                         downhill since John Kennedy was 
                         killed, Senator.

                                     LONG
                         Don't get me started on that.  Those 
                         Warren Commission fellows were pickin' 
                         gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's 
                         gonna tell me that kid did the 
                         shooting job he did from that damned 
                         bookstore.

                         Here you go, Senator Long.

               The stewardess brings more drinks.

                                     JIM
                              (surprised)
                         I thought the FBI test-fired the 
                         rifle to make sure it could be done?

                                     LONG
                         Sure, three experts and not one of 
                         them could do it!  They're telling 
                         us Oswald got off three shots with 
                         world-class precision from a manual 
                         bolt action rifle in less than six 
                         seconds - and accordin' to his Marine 
                         buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he 
                         wasn't any good.  Average man would 
                         be lucky to get two shots off, and I 
                         tell ya the first shot would always 
                         be the best.  Here, the third shot's 
                         perfect.  Don't make sense.  And 
                         then they got that crazy bullet 
                         zigzagging all over the place so it 
                         hits Kennedy and Connally seven times.  
                         One "pristine" bullet?  That dog 
                         don't hunt.

                                     JIM
                         You know, something always bothered 
                         me about that from day one, and I 
                         can't put my finger on it.

                         If I were investigatin', I'd round 
                         up the 100 best riflemen in the world 
                         and find out which ones were in Dallas 
                         that day.  You been duck hunting?  I 
                         think Oswald was a good old-fashioned 
                         decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a 
                         patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes 
                         y'ask me.

                                     JIM
                         You think there were other men 
                         involved, Russell?

               Russell looks at Jim quizzically and laughs.

                                     LONG
                         Hell, you're the District Attorney.  
                         You read the Warren Report - and 
                         then you tell me you're satisfied 
                         Lee Oswald shot the President all by 
                         his lonesome.

                                     JIM
                         Russell, honestly you sound like one 
                         of those kooky critics spreading 
                         paranoia like prairie fire.  I just 
                         can't believe the Chief Justice of 
                         the United States would put his name 
                         on something that wasn't true.

                         it's gonna put that other varmint 
                         Nixon in - then watch your hide,

               GARRISON'S STUDY - NIGHT(1966)

               The study is lined with bookshelves up to the ceiling; we 
               see photos of family, a chess set.  Jim, smoking his pipe, 
               reads in a red leather chair from one of the 26 thick Warren 
               Commission volumes piled all over the place.  Liz enters.  
               Jasper, now 7, draws on a piece of paper on the floor at

                         Mmmmm... sure smells good... but 
                         Egghead, do you realize Oswald was 
                         interrogated for twelve hours after 
                         the assassination, with no lawyer 
                         present, and nobody recorded a word 
                         of it?  I can't believe it.  A police 
                         captain with 30 years experience and 
                         a crowd of Federal agents just had 
                         to know that with no record anything 
                         that Oswald said would be inadmissible 
                         in court.

                         Come on now, we'll talk about it at 
                         the table, dinner's getting cold.
                              (to Jasper)
                         What are you doing in here?

                                     JASPER
                         Daddy said it was all right if I was 
                         real quiet.

                                     JIM
                              (rising to dinner)
                         Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever 
                         handled a minor felon like that, 
                         it'd be all over the papers.  I'd 
                         catch hell.  And this is the alleged 
                         murderer of the President?

               GARRISON DINING ROOM - (1966)

               Two-year-old Elizabeth watches "Crusader Rabbit" on TV as 
               the new one-year-old sits in diapers with Liz at one end of 
               the dinner table.  Jim sits at the other end.  There are 
               five kids now, ages 7, 5, 4, 2 and 1... and Mattie, the 
               housekeeper.  Dinner's finished, they pass plates, the 
               children horse around... the boxer dog, Touchdown, begs for 
               a piece of the action.  Jim, not a big eater, feeds him ice 
               cream.

                                     JIM
                         Again and again they ignore credible 
                         testimony, leads are never followed 
                         up, its conclusions are selective, 
                         there's no index, it's one of the 
                         sloppiest, most disorganized 
                         investigations I've ever seen.  Dozens 
                         and dozens of witnesses in Dealey 
                         Plaza that day are saying they heard 
                         shots coming from the Grassy Knoll 
                         area in front of Kennedy and not the 
                         Book Depository behind him, but it's 
                         all broken down and spread around 
                         and you read it and the point gets 
                         lost.

                                     MATTIE
                         I never did believe it either!

                                     LIZ
                              (politely listening)
                         Uh huh... Mattie, I'll do the dishes, 
                         you take Be up now.  And Elizabeth, 
                         too, your bedtime, honey.

                                     ELIZABETH JR.
                         Nahhhh!  I don't wanna go to bed!

                                     LIZ
                         Honey, that was three years ago - we 
                         all tried so hard to put that out of 
                         our minds, why are you digging it up 
                         again?  You're the D.A. of New 
                         Orleans.  Isn't the Kennedy 
                         assassination a bit outside your 
                         domain?  I mean all those important 
                         people already studied it.

                                     JIM
                         I can't believe a man as intelligent 
                         as Earl Warren ever read what's in 
                         those volumes.

                                     LIZ
                         Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll 
                         give you one hour to solve the case... 
                         until the kids are in bed.
                              (rising, she puts her 
                              arms around him from 
                              behind and kisses 
                              his ear)
                         Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can 
                         wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody 
                         say goodnight to Daddy.

                                     JASPER
                              (showing his drawing)
                         Dad, look what I drew.

                                     JIM
                              (rising)
                         That's something, Jasper.  What is 
                         it?

                                     JASPER
                         A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another 
                         hour?

               Virginia and Snapper each get one of Jim's shoes as he dances 
               with them, holding one with each hand.

                                     JIM
                              (dancing)
                         Pickle and Snapper, my two favorite 
                         dancing partners.

               As the children dance, they fall off Jim's feet, laughing 
               and giggling.  He throws each in the air and kisses them.

                                     JIM
                         Goodnight, my doodle bugs.

                                     KIDS
                         Goodnight, Daddy.

               Liz comes over, smiling.  Jim takes her in his arms.

                                     LIZ
                         One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday 
                         night date you are.
                              (sighs)
                         Mama warned me this would happen if 
                         I married such a serious man.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up 
                         I'll show you how Saturday night got 
                         invented.

               GARRISON STUDY - LATER THAT NIGHT(1966)

               The clock on mantelpiece reads 3 A.M.  Jim is alone, smoking 
               his pipe.

               In the stillness, his mind crawls all over the place.  The 
               camera closes on the thickly-worded pages of the Warren 
               Report.

               FLASHBACK TO the Warren Commission hearing room in Dallas, 
               1964.  We hear thin, echoey sound as the attorneys question 
               some of the witnesses.

               The overall effect is vague and confusing, as is much of the 
               Warren Report.  A Mr. Ball is questioning Lee Bowers, the 
               switchman in the railroad yard.  Bowers, in his early 40's, 
               has a trustworthy, working-man face and a crew cut.

                                     BOWERS
                         I sealed off the area, and I held 
                         off the trains until they could be 
                         examined, and there was some 
                         transients taken on at least one 
                         train.

                                     ATTORNEY
                         Mr. Bowers... is there anything else 
                         you told me I haven't asked you about 
                         that you can think of?

                                     BOWERS
                         Nothing that I can recall.

                                     ATTORNEY
                         Witness is excused.

               Jim, upset, reads on... Another witness, Sgt. D.V. Harkness 
               of the Dallas Police responds to a second attorney.

                                     SGT. HARKNESS
                         Well we got a long freight that was 
                         in there, and we pulled some people 
                         off of there and took them to the 
                         station.

               We see another FLASHBACK - to the Dallas rail yards on the 
               day of the assassination.  Three hoboes are being pulled off 
               the freight by the Dallas policemen.

                                     ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                         You mean some transients?

                                     SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)
                         Tramps and hoboes.

                                     ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                         Were all those questioned?

               FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza an hour or less after the 
               assassination.  The three hoboes are marched by shotgun-toting 
               policemen to the Sheriff's office at Dealey Plaza.  We note 
               that they do not look much like hoboes.

                                     SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)
                         Yes, sir, they were taken to the 
                         station and questioned.

                                     JIM
                              (astounded)
                         And?
                              (writes "incomplete")

                                     ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                              (switching subjects)
                         I want to go back to this Amos Euins.
                              (voices dribble off)

                                     BOWERS (V.O.)
                         Yes sir, traffic had been cut off 
                         into the area since about 10, but 
                         there were three cars came in during 
                         this time from around noon till the 
                         time of the shooting... the cars 
                         circled the parking lot, and left 
                         like they were checking the area, 
                         one of the drivers seemed to have 
                         something he was holding to his 
                         mouth... the last car came in about 
                         7 to 10 minutes before the shooting, 
                         a white Chevrolet, 4-door Impala, 
                         muddy up to the windows.

               The camera's point of view is now from the railroad tower 
               near Dealey Plaza.  We are fourteen feet off the ground, 
               overlooking the parking lot behind the Grassy Knoll.  The 
               shot includes this last car circling in the lot.

                                     BOWERS
                         Towards the underpass, I saw two men 
                         standing behind a picket fence... 
                         they were looking up towards Main 
                         and Houston and following the caravan 
                         as it came down.  One of them was 
                         middle-aged, heavyset.  The other 
                         man was younger, wearing a plaid 
                         shirt and jacket.

               Inside the railroad tower, Bowers glances out, busy with the 
               main board, flashing lights, a train coming in.

                                     BOWERS
                         There were two other men on the 
                         eastern end of the parking lot.  
                         Each of 'me had uniforms.

               We see the parking lot from Bower's point of view - at a 
               distance, but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at 
               a distance, tow uniformed men.  The parking lot is bumper-to-
               bumper with a sea of cars.  Rain that morning has muddied 
               the lot.  These brief images are elaborated on later.

                                     BOWERS
                         At the time of the shooting there 
                         seemed to be some commotion... I 
                         just am unable to describe - a flash 
                         of light or smoke or something which
                         caused me to feel that something out 
                         of the ordinary had occurred there 
                         on the embankment...

               We feel the growing intensity: music, drums - but all blurred.  
               We see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window 
               Bowers is glancing through.  A motorcycle cop shoots up the 
               Grassy Knoll incline.  People run, blurring into a larger 
               mosaic of confusion.  Bowers is confused, seeing this.

               INTERCUT with Jim's heart pounding as he reads.

               Back in Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, an elderly signal 
               supervisor, stands on the parapet of the railway.

                                     HOLLAND (V.O.)
                         Four shots... a puff of smoke came 
                         from the trees... behind that picket 
                         fence... close to the little plaza - 
                         There's no doubt whatever in my mind.

               We see the scene from Holland's point of view - the puff of 
               smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after 
               the shooting.

               GARRISON BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT(1966)

               Jim is asleep, having a tortured dream.

               DREAMSCAPE FLASHBACK: We see the Zapruder film, in slow-motion 
               and J.F.K.'s face just before he goes behind Stemmons Freeway 
               sign.  Jim sits up suddenly.

                                     JIM
                         NO!

               Liz stirs, shaken.

                         It's incredible, honey - the whole 
                         thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies 
                         that Lee Oswald was given a Russian 
                         language exam as part of his Marine 
                         training only a few months before he 
                         defects to the Soviet Union.  A 
                         Russian exam!

                         I cannot believe this.  It's four-
                         thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five 
                         children are gonna be awake in another

                                     JIM
                         Honey, in all my years in the service 
                         I never knew a single man who was 
                         given a Russian test.  Oswald was a 
                         radar operator.  He'd have about as 
                         much use for Russian as a cat has 
                         for pajamas.

                                     LIZ
                         These books are getting to your mind, 
                         Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop 
                         readin' them.

                                     JIM
                         And then this Colonel tries to make 
                         it sound like nothing.  Oswald did 
                         badly on the test, he says.  "He 
                         only had two more Russian words right 
                         than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me 
                         saying Touchdown here...
                              (points to the dog)
                         ...is not very intelligent because I 
                         beat him three games out of five the 
                         last time we played chess.

                         Jim, what is going on, for heaven's 
                         sake!  You going to stay up all night 
                         every night?  For what?  So you'll 
                         be the only man in America who read 
                         the entire 26 volumes of the Warren 
                         Report?

                         Liz, do I have to spell it out for 
                         you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary 
                         soldier.  That was no accident he 
                         was in Russia.  He was probably in 
                         military intelligence.  That's why 
                         he was trained in Russian.

                                     LIZ
                              (with a quizzical 
                              look)

               She takes him now, gently, and pulls him down on top of her 
               and kisses him.

                         Kennedy for a few minutes, honey... 
                         come on.

               LAFAYETTE SQUARE - NEW ORLEANS - MORNING(1966)

               A Sunday, early.  We see a statue of Ben Franklin in an empty 
               square frequented by drunks who doze on benches in a little 
               leafy park in the center of the Square.  The camera moves to 
               Jim by himself and then moves to a sedan, pulling up, which 
               disgorges Lou Ivon and Bill Broussard.

                                     JIM
                         Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking 
                         tour?

                                     BILL
                         At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not 
                         exactly fresh blood we're sniffing 
                         here, boss.

                                     JIM
                              (points)
                         Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.

               TIME CUT TO Jim indicating 531 Lafayette Street, a seedy, 
               faded, three-story building across the street from the square.

                                     JIM
                         Remember whose office this was back 
                         in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.

                                     LOU
                         Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He 
                         died couple years ago.

               FLASHBACK TO the exterior of the Banister Office on a day in 
               1963.  The door is now clearly labelled "W. GUY BANISTER, 
               INC. INVESTIGATORS."  It opens and Banister comes out in 
               slow motion, neatly dressed, rose in his lapel - the same 
               office and same man we saw three years before when he pistol-
               whipped Jack Martin.  Banister seems to be smiling right at 
               us, greeting us.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Headed the Chicago office.  When he 
                         retired he became a private eye here.  
                         I used to have lunch with him.  John 
                         Birch Society, Minutemen, slightly 
                         to the right of Attila the Hun.  
                         Used to recruit college students to 
                         infiltrate radical organizations on 
                         campus.  All out of this office.  
                         Now come around here, take a look at 
                         this...

               Back to the Lafayette Square of 1966.  Jim walks Ivon and 
               Bill to the corner, to another entrance to the same building - 
               this one with a sign that says "544 Camp Street."

                                     JIM
                         544 Camp Street.  Same building as 
                         531 Lafayette, right... but different 
                         address and different entrances both 
                         going to the same place - the offices 
                         on the second and third floors.

               Bill studies the present sign: "Crescent City Dental 
               Laboratory", and gives Jim a puzzled look.

                                     JIM
                         Guess who used this address?

               Lou gets it and glances up.  We FLASHBACK TO the exterior of 
               544 Camp Street in 1963.  Lee Oswald comes out the door into 
               a full close-up, now clearly seen by us, and heads out into 
               the street as Guy Banister intercepts him on the sidewalk, 
               holding a leaflet and point to "544 Camp Street stamped on 
               it.  Guy seems miffed at Oswald, tells him something quickly, 
               and then moves on.

                                     BANISTER
                              (under)
                         See this?  What the hell is this 
                         doing on this piece of paper?
                              (he moves away)
                         Asshole.

                                     LOU (V.O.)
                         My God!  Lee Harvey Oswald.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Bull's-eye.  How do we know he was 
                         here?  Cause this office address was 
                         stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he 
                         was handing out in the summer of '63 
                         down on Canal street.  They were the 
                         same leaflets that were found in his 
                         garage in Dallas.

               FLASHBACK to Canal Street in New Orleans on a summer day in 
               1963.  Oswald, in a thin tie and white short-sleeved shirt, 
               and wearing a homemade placard reading "Hands Off Cuba"; 
               "Viva Fidel!", is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two 
               young helpers.

               A large white-haired businessman in a white suit, very 
               distinguished, walks with a friend on Canal Street.  Oswald 
               glances at him and meets his eyes.  The businessman enters 
               an office building.  This man is Clay Bertrand, later known 
               as Clay Shaw.

               Some Cubans, led by Carols Bringuier, now appear.  One of 
               them, "the Bull", is heavy-set with dark glasses.  More of 
               him will also be seen.

                                     JIM
                         He was arrested that day for fighting 
                         with some anti-Castro Cubans... but 
                         actually he had contacted them a few 
                         days earlier as an ex-Marine trying 
                         to join the anti-Castro crusade.  
                         When they heard he was now pro-Castro, 
                         they paid him a visit.

                                     CARLOS
                              (haranguing passerby)
                         He's a traitor, this man!  Don't 
                         believe a word he tells you!
                              (to Oswald)
                         You sonofabitch, you liar, you're a 
                         Communist, go back to Moscow.

               Carlos throws Oswald's leaflets in the air and pulls off his 
               glasses, prepared to fight.  Oswald only smiles, and puts 
               his arms down in an X of passivity.

                                     OSWALD
                         Okay, Carlos, if you want to hit me, 
                         hit me.

               There is no real fight, but the police, as if pre-alerted, 
               arrive.

               Arrests are made.  We see Oswald in a room in the police 
               station, talking with FBI Agent John Quigley.  A calendar on 
               the wall shows that it's August, 1963.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         There was no real fight and the 
                         arresting Lieutenant later said he 
                         felt it was a staged incident.  In 
                         jail, Oswald asked to talk to Special 
                         Agent John Quigley of the FBI who 
                         showed up immediately.  They have a 
                         private session.  Oswald is released 
                         and Quigley destroys his notes from 
                         the interview.

               In a television studio in 1963, Oswald debates Carlos 
               Bringuier with two moderators.

                                     JIM
                         But the arrest gets him a lot of 
                         publicity and as a result Oswald 
                         appears on a local TV debate that 
                         established his credentials as a 
                         Communist.

                                     BRINGUIER
                         But you're a Communist, are you not, 
                         and you defected to Russia.

                                     OSWALD
                         No, I am not a Communist.  But I am 
                         a Marxist-Leninist.

                                     BRINGUIER
                         What did you do when you were in 
                         Russia?

                                     OSWALD
                              (defensive)
                         I worked while I was there.  I was 
                         always under the protection of... 
                         that is to say, I was not under the 
                         protection of the U.S. Government.

               Back in 1966, Jim walks with his two assistants.

                                     BILL
                         What the hell's a Communist like Lee 
                         Oswald doing working out of 
                         Banister's?

                                     JIM
                         Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill?  
                         I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was 
                         ever a Communist... after the arrest, 
                         544 Camp Street never appeared on 
                         the pamphlets again.  Now here's 
                         another one for you:  What would you 
                         say if I told you Lee Oswald had 
                         been trained in the Russian language 
                         when he was a Marine?

                                     LOU
                         I'd say he was probably getting 
                         intelligence training.

                                     JIM
                         Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who 
                         would be running that training?

                                     LOU
                         The Office of Naval Intelligence.

                                     JIM
                         Take a look across the street.

               We see the Post Office building across the street.

                                     LOU
                         Post Office.

                                     JIM
                         Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office 
                         of Naval Intelligence - And just by 
                         coincidence, Banister, before he was 
                         FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?

                                     LOU
                         "Once ONI, always ONI"?

                                     BILL
                         Well, he likes to work near his old 
                         pals.

               Jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole Square.

                                     JIM
                         Bill, Lou, we're standing in the 
                         heart of the United States 
                         Government's intelligence community 
                         in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, 
                         the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't 
                         this seem to you a rather strange 
                         place for a Communist to spend his 
                         spare time?

                                     LOU
                         What are you driving at, boss?

                                     JIM
                         We're going back into the case, Lou - 
                         the murder of the President.  I want 
                         you to take some money from the Fees 
                         and Fines Account and go to Dallas - 
                         talk to some people.  Bill, I want 
                         you to get Oser on the medical, the 
                         autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby 
                         histories, tax records...

                                     BILL
                         Lord, wake me, please.  I must be 
                         dreaming.

                                     JIM
                         No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead 
                         serious.  And we're going to start 
                         by tracking down your anonymous source 
                         from three years ago.  How did you 
                         find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas 
                         that day?

               RACETRACK - DAY(1966)

               A straggly group of people watch from the grandstands eating 
               hotdogs and talking in small clusters.  The horses are running 
               early morning laps.  Three men sit apart in the bleachers.  
               A scared Jack Martin, three years older than when last seen, 
               still wearing the Dick Tracy hat, sucks up coffee like a 
               worm does moisture.  He has the red puffy cheeks of an 
               alcoholic and deeply circled, worried eyes.  Bill and Jim 
               wait.

                                     JIM
                         You're not under cross-examination 
                         here, Jack.

               What I need is a little clarification about the night Guy 
               Banister beat you over the head with his Magnum.  You called 
               our office hopping mad from your hospital bed.  Don't tell 
               me you don't remember that?

               Jack looks away and doesn't respond.

                                     JIM
                         Here's my problem, Jack.  You told 
                         me you and Guy were good friends for 
                         a long time?

                                     MARTIN
                         More than ten years.

                                     JIM
                         And he never hit you before?

                                     MARTIN
                         Never touched me.

                                     JIM
                         Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day 
                         of the President's murder - our police 
                         report says he pistol-whipped you 
                         with a .357 Magnum.
                              (Martin's eyes are 
                              fixed on Jim)
                         But the police report says you had 
                         an argument over the phone bill.  
                         Here, take a look at it.
                              (Martin looks at the 
                              report)
                         Now, does a simple argument over 
                         phone bills sound like a believable 
                         explanation to you?

               SUDDEN FLASHBACK to the night of the pistol-whipping.  The 
               camera shows Banister laying Martin's head open / the beating 
               the humiliation.

                                     MARTIN
                              (shaking his head 
                              slowly, dreamily)
                         No, it involved more than that.

               Bill looks at Jim.

                                     JIM
                         How much more?

                                     MARTIN
                              (waits)
                         I don't know if I should talk about 
                         this.

                                     JIM
                         Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, 
                         you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

                                     MARTIN
                         If you buy what you read in the paper.

                                     JIM
                         You have other information?

                                     MARTIN
                         I didn't say that.  All I know is he 
                         died suddenly just before the Warren 
                         Report came out.

                                     JIM
                         Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

                                     MARTIN
                         Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, 
                         it don't really matter... it was 
                         about the people hanging around the 
                         office that summer.  I wasn't really 
                         part of the operation, you know.  I 
                         was handling the private-eye work 
                         for Guy when that came in - not much 
                         did - but that's why I was there... 
                         it was a nuthouse.  There were all 
                         these Cubans coming and going.  They 
                         all looked alike to me.

               FLASHBACK to Banister's office in 1963.  There are Cubans in 
               battle fatigues and combat boots; duffle bags are lying 
               around.  David Ferrie, in fatigues, directs the Cubans as 
               they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room.  
               Martin observes from another desk.

                                     MARTIN
                         Dave Ferrie - you know about him?

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Was he there often?

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Often?  He practically lived there.  
                         It was real cloak and dagger stuff.  
                         They called it Operation Mongoose.  
                         The idea was to train all these Cuban 
                         exiles for another invasion of Cuba.  
                         Banister's office was part of a supply 
                         line that ran from Dallas, through 
                         New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling 
                         arms and explosives.

               Still in 1963, we see the exterior of Banister's office.  A 
               dozen Cubans follow Ferrie downstairs into the street, and 
               pile into several cars, duffels thrown in with them.  Ferrie 
               drives the lead car.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         All this right under the noses of 
                         the intelligence community in 
                         Lafayette Square?

               We see the cars cross the long Lake Pontchartrain Bridge and 
               enter a remote guerrilla training camp.  Bayou and jungle 
               are all around.

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Sure.  Everybody knew everybody.  It 
                         was a network.  They were working 
                         for the CIA - pilots, black operations 
                         guys, civilians, military - everybody 
                         in those days was running guns 
                         somewhere... Fort Jefferson, Bayou 
                         Bluff, Morgan City... McAllen, Texas 
                         was a big gun-running operation.

               At the guerrilla training camp at Lake Pontchartrain in 1963, 
               we see scenes of basic training - shooting, obstacle courses, 
               callisthenics - led by Ferrie and other trainers.  Scattered 
               among the Cubans are several white American mercenaries.  We 
               catch a glimpse of Oswald and glimpses of several other men 
               we will see again, in sprinklings.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Where is Banister in all this?

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Banister was running his camp north 
                         of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled 
                         a lot of the training.  There was a 
                         shooting range and a lot of tropical 
                         terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans 
                         got trained, too.  Nazi types.  
                         Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the 
                         craziest.

               It's night at the training camp.  FBI agents race up in cars 
               in the middle of the night, swarming over the camp, rounding 
               up the trainees.

                                     MARTIN
                         Anyway, late summer the party ended.  
                         Kennedy didn't want another Bay of 
                         Pigs mess, so he ordered the FBI to 
                         shut down the camps and confiscate 
                         the napalm and the C-4.  There were 
                         a buncha Cubans and a couple Americans 
                         arrested, only you didn't read about 
                         it in the papers.  Just the weapons 
                         got mentioned... 'cause the first 
                         ones behind bars would've been 
                         Banister and Ferrie, but I think the 
                         G-men were just going through the 
                         motions for Washington.  Their hearts 
                         were with their old FBI buddy 
                         Banister.

               We see FBI agents loading dynamite, bomb casings, arms 155mm 
               artillery shells, etc.

               Back at the racetrack in 1966, Jim listens.

                                     MARTIN
                         Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

                                     JIM
                         And Oswald?

               Martin hesitates.  We hear the rhythmic beating of the horse 
               hooves and Martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee.

                                     MARTIN
                              (finally)
                         Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes 
                         he'd be meeting with Banister with 
                         the door shut.  Other times he'd be 
                         shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But 
                         he was there all right.

                                     JIM
                         Anything more specific, Jack?  It's 
                         important.

               FLASHBACK TO Banister's office in 1963.  Banister and Martin 
               shooting the breeze as the straight-laced middle-aged 
               secretary, Delphine Roberts, hurries in.

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Yeah, one time the secretary got 
                         upset, I remember...

                                     SECRETARY
                         I can't believe it, Mr. Banister.  
                         Lee Oswald is down on Canal Street 
                         giving out Communist leaflets 
                         supporting Castro!

               Banister just looks at her and laughs.

                                     BANISTER
                         It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

               Back at the racetrack...

                                     JIM
                         Anyone else involved at Banister's 
                         level?

                                     MARTIN
                              (shrugs)
                         There was one guy, I don't know, big 
                         guy, business guy, white hair - I 
                         saw him come into the office once.  
                         He looked out of place, y'know - 
                         like a society guy.  Can't remember 
                         his name.
                              (thinking)
                         Oswald was with him. 

               FLASHBACK to Banisters office on a day in 1963.  Martin is 
               snooping in Banister's files.  Cut to Martin leaving the 
               office as a big businessman with white hair briefly talks to 
               Oswald and then goes into Banister's private office.

                                     MARTIN
                         He had something to do with money.  
                         I remember him cause Guy, who didn't 
                         kiss anybody's ass, sure kissed his.

               Banister lets the man into his private office.

                                     MARTIN
                         Clay something, that was his name - 
                         Clay.

                                     JIM
                         Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?

                                     MARTIN
                         Yeah!  That's it.
                              (pause, paranoid)
                         I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I 
                         gotta go.

                                     JIM
                              (to Bill)
                         Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren 
                         Report.  He tried to get Oswald a 
                         lawyer.
                              (to Martin)
                         Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

                                     MARTIN
                         Sure.  'Course they hated the 
                         sonofabitch, but...

                                     JIM
                         The assassination, Jack?

                                     MARTIN
                              (tightens)
                         Never.  Not with me sir, never... 
                         Listen, I think I'd better go.  I 
                         said enough.  I said all I'm going 
                         to say.
                              (rises suddenly)

                                     JIM
                         Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?

                                     MARTIN
                         What's the problem?  What's the 
                         problem?  Do I need to spell it out 
                         for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.

                                     JIM
                         Nobody knows what we're talking about, 
                         Jack.

                                     MARTIN
                         You're so naive, mister.

               Martin picks his way nervously down the bleacher benches.

               CAR - FRENCH QUARTER - DAY(1966)

               Jim drives, with Numa in the front and Bill in the back.

                                     BILL
                         Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, 
                         but the man's an obvious alcoholic 
                         with a reputation lower than crocodile 
                         piss.

                                     JIM
                         Does that bother you, Bill?  I always 
                         wondered in court why it is because 
                         a woman is a prostitute, she has to 
                         have bad eyesight.

                                     BILL
                         He'll never sign a statement, boss, 
                         let alone get on a witness stand.

                                     JIM
                         When something's rotten in the land, 
                         Bill, it generally isn't just one 
                         fish, we'll get corroboration... 
                         find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were 
                         a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 
                         it's an alias.  Start checking around 
                         the Quarter.

                                     BILL
                         And the six of us, with almost no 
                         budget and in secret, are going to 
                         solve the case that the Warren 
                         Commission with dozens of support 
                         staff and millions of dollars couldn't 
                         solve.  We can't keep up with the 
                         crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.

                                     JIM
                         The murder of a President, Bill, is 
                         a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I 
                         didn't pick you because of your legal 
                         skill, you know.

                                     BILL
                         Gee, thanks boss.

               Jim pulls the car over to park.

                                     JIM
                         But because you're a fighter.  I 
                         like a man who isn't scared of bad 
                         odds.

               FRENCH QUARTER SIDEWALK - DAY(1966)

               Jim and the others get out of the car and head towards 
               Antoine's Restaurant.  A black woman greets him.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         How ya doing, Mr. Garrison?  Remember 
                         me - from the piano bar at the Royal 
                         Orleans?

                                     JIM
                         I sure do.  We sang "You're the Cream 
                         in My Coffee."

               She laughs.  Others move in on him.

                                     JIM
                              (to Numa)
                         Make sure we come back here, now.

               ANTOINE'S RESTAURANT - DAY(1966)

               They enter a busy lunchtime crowd in an elegant eatery.  Lou 
               Ivon and Al Oser are waiting for them as they're shown to 
               their table by the Maitre d'.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Mr. Garrison, we have not seen enough 
                         of you lately.

                                     JIM
                         Been too busy, Paul - an elected man 
                         can't have as much fun as he used 
                         to.
                              (seeing Lou and Al)
                         Welcome back, Lou.  Find out anything 
                         on those hobos?

               Lou's been waiting, excited.  He gives Jim blowups of the 
               five hobo photographs.

                                     LOU
                         They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, 
                         not the police station, and they let 
                         'em go.  No record of them ever being 
                         questioned.

                                     JIM
                         I can't say that comes as a surprise 
                         anymore.

                                     LOU
                         A photographer from The Dallas Times 
                         Herald got some great shots of them 
                         never published...

               The camera moves in on the photographs.

               FLASHBACK TO the "hoboes" being escorted to the Sheriff's 
               office - as per Sgt. Harkness' earlier description.

                                     LOU
                         ...take a good look, chief, do any 
                         of 'em look like the hoboes you 
                         remember?

                                     JIM
                         Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep 
                         in their clothes - these two look 
                         pretty young.

                                     LOU
                         ...not a single frayed collar or 
                         cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, 
                         clean hands - new shoe leather.  
                         Look at the ear of the cop... That's 
                         a wire.  What's a cop wearing a 
                         headset for?  I think they're actors, 
                         chief; they're not cops.

               Susie Cox arrives.

                                     JIM
                         Who the hell are they, then!  Hi, 
                         Susie, sit down.
                              (to Lou)
                         This could be it.  Let's start looking 
                         for 'em.

               How 'bout that railroad man, Lee Bowers?  Saw those men at 
               the picket fence?

                                     LOU
                         Graveyard dead.  August this year.
                              (Jim curses quietly)
                         A single car accident on an empty 
                         road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor 
                         said he was in some kind of strange 
                         shock when he died.
                              (pause)

                                     JIM
                              (shares the look)
                         We need to find more witnesses, Lou.

                                     LOU
                         There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore.  
                         Two Cubans threw her out of a car on 
                         the way to Dallas.

               She talked to a cop from a hospital bed two days before the 
               assassination, said Kennedy would be hit that Friday.  She 
               said she was a dope runner for Jack Ruby and that Ruby knew 
               Oswald for years...

                                     JIM
                         Can we find her?

                                     LOU
                         Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas 
                         in '65.  Two in the morning on some 
                         highway.  A hit and run.

               FLASHBACK to Rose lying dead on an empty highway.

                                     BILL
                         Why not go right to the horse's mouth, 
                         chief?

               Jack Ruby's been rotting in a Dallas jail cell for three 
               years.  Maybe he's ready to crack?

                                     JIM
                         If we go to him our investigation'll 
                         hit the front pages by sunrise.  
                         Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was 
                         just given a new trial.  If he has 
                         something to say, it'll be there.  
                         Susie, what did you find out on 
                         Oswald?

                                     SUSIE
                         Negative on his tax records.  
                         Classified.  First time I know a 
                         D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put 
                         together a list of all the CIA files 
                         on Oswald that were part of the Warren 
                         Report and asked for them.  There 
                         are about 1200 documents...
                              (gives it to Jim who 
                              reads)
                         Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, 
                         Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel 
                         file, a memo from the Director on 
                         Oswald, travel and activities - can't 
                         get one of them.  All classified as 
                         secret on the grounds of national 
                         security.  It's real strange.

                                     BILL
                         Maybe there's more to this, Susie.  
                         The CIA's keeping something from our 
                         enemies.

                         Yes, but we're talking about a dead 
                         warehouse employee of no political 
                         significance.  Three years later and 
                         he's still classified?  They gave us 
                         his grammar school records, a study 
                         of his pubic hairs... Put it in 
                         context, Bill, of what we know about 
                         Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, 
                         unstable childhood, high school 
                         dropout - wants to grow up and be a 
                         spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He 
                         learns Russian, he acts overtly 
                         Marxist with two other marines, but 
                         he's stationed at a top secret base 
                         in Japan where U2 spy flights over 
                         Russia originate.  He's discharged 
                         from the Marines supposedly because 
                         his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 
                         days, then with a $1500 ticket from 
                         a $203 bank account, he goes to 
                         Moscow...

               FLASHBACK TO Moscow in 1959.  We see shots of the city - 
               strange and eerie black-and-white stills.  Inside the U.S. 
               Embassy Oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal 
               letter.  Two consuls attend him.

                                     OSWALD
                              (voice stilted)
                         I want to renounce my citizenship 
                         and become a Soviet citizen.  I'm 
                         going to make known to them all 
                         information I have concerning the 
                         Marine Corps and my specialty therein, 
                         radar operation...

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         One of the consuls, John McVickar, 
                         says Oswald's performance was not 
                         spontaneous - it seemed coached.  
                         Oswald gives an interview to a 
                         journalist.

               Continuing the Moscow flashback, we see Oswald talking with 
               a female journalist in his small room in the Hotel Metropole.  
               Again he sounds robotic.

                                     OSWALD
                         I will never return to the United 
                         States for any reason.  It is a 
                         capitalist country, an exploitive, 
                         racist country.  I am a Marxist since 
                         I was 15.  I've seen poor niggers 
                         and that was a real lesson.  People 
                         hate because they're told to hate, 
                         like school kids.  It's the fashion 
                         to hate people in the U.S.

                         The Russians are skeptical - want to 
                         send him back.  Maybe they suspect 
                         he's a spy.  He supposedly slashes 
                         his wrists in a suicide attempt so 
                         that they're forced to keep him, and 
                         he disappears for six weeks, 
                         presumably with the KGB.

               We see photos of the city of Minks, in Russia, Oswald with 
               various friends and tourists, shots of Lee and Marina with a 
               new baby.

                         Finally they shuttle him to a radio 
                         factory in Minks where he lives as 
                         high on the hog as he ever has - 
                         he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy 
                         apartment with a balcony, has affairs 
                         with local girls.

                         any propaganda for the Russians.  He 
                         meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel 
                         in Soviet intelligence, at a trade 
                         union dance; she thinks he's Russian 
                         the way he speaks, six weeks later 
                         they marry, have a daughter.

                         Didn't someone say he didn't speak 
                         good Russian?

                         to them.  The only explanation for 
                         the royal treatment is he did give 
                         them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.

               We see documentary shots of the U2 on Russian soil... Francis 
               Gary Powers... The Summit Conference canceled... Eisenhower 
               and Khrushchev.

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         I don't know if it's coincidence, 
                         but Oswald had a top security 
                         clearance and knew about the U2 
                         program from his days at Atsugi Air 
                         Base in Japan.  Six months after he 
                         arrives in Russia, Francis Gary 
                         Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in 
                         Russia.  That plane was untouchable.  
                         Powers hinted that Oswald could've 
                         given the Russians enough data to 
                         hit it.  As a direct result, the 
                         peace summit between Khrushchev and 
                         Eisenhower failed.  I can't help 
                         thinking of that book Seven Days In 
                         May, maybe someone in our military 
                         didn't want the Peace Conference to 
                         happen, maybe Oswald was part of 
                         that.  It gets weirder.

                         1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers 
                         defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, 
                         seven defect, six return, one of 
                         them another Marine a month before 
                         Oswald.  All of them young men made 
                         to seem poor, disenchanted.

                         in '63.  A man who has defected once 
                         already.  It's crazy.

                         did everything short of dispatching

               FLASHBACK TO a Forth Worth map factory.  We see Oswald at 
               work on photo mattes with a Minox spy camera.  The camera 
               shows close-ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the

               on the Oswald photo - and a razor blade cutting mattes.

                         explodes.  Oswald may have had access

               FLASHBACK TO Fort Worth in 1963.  In Oswald's cheap apartment, 
               seven White Russians, including George de Mohrenschildt, a 
               distinguished grey-haired man in his late fifties, are 
               visiting Marina and Oswald, bringing old dresses, groceries,

                         up in colonial countries and each 
                         time something strange happens.  
                         Coup d'etats, presidents overthrown.  
                         He shows up on a "walking tour" of 
                         Guatemala's Cuban invasion camps 
                         just before the Bay of Pigs invasion.  
                         If we don't know he's CIA, let's 
                         circle him very probable - Oswald's 
                         handler.

               We see Oswald and de Mohrenschildt talking with the others 
               and a magazine cover with J.F.K. the subject of discussion.

                                     OSWALD
                         I think he's made some mistakes on 
                         Cuba, but he's doing a pretty good 
                         job.  If he succeeds, in my opinion, 
                         he'll be a great President.  And a 
                         really attractive one too - open 
                         features, great head of hair...

                         De Mohrenschildt draws a picture of 
                         Oswald as an intellectual, well read, 
                         speaks excellent Russian, a man who 
                         adored J.F.K.

                                     JIM
                         That's scenery.  Don't get 
                         sidetracked.  This is the man, bottom 
                         line, who nailed Oswald to the Warren 
                         Commission as a potentially violent 
                         man, and linked him to the rifle.

               TIME CUT TO Oswald's apartment on a different day in 1963.  
               George de Mohrenschildt points out a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle 
               in the closet, turns to Lee.

                                     GEORGE
                         So, Lee, what are you taking a potshot 
                         at this week - rabbits or fascists?

               Lee's look is sickly.  He freezes up.

                         The only Russian that suspects Oswald 
                         of still being a Communist is Anna 
                         Meller.  But her Russian friend tells 
                         her "he's checked" with the local 
                         FBI and was told Oswald is all right.

               Anna Meller, one of the guests, glances at a copy of Das 
               Kapital in a pile of books, and talks to another Russian man 
               about it... Talking now to Lee and Marina are Janet and Bill 
               Williams, a mid-American couple in their late twenties, 
               freshly minted.

                                     SUSIE
                         The Oswalds are introduced by George 
                         de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill 
                         Williams.  It's through Janet Williams 
                         in October '63 that Lee gets the 
                         warehouse job, right smack on Elm 
                         Street at the Book Depository, which 
                         is owned by another oilman with ties 
                         to defense and military intelligence.

                         Presumably so he can now exercise 
                         his intellect stacking school texts 
                         at $1.25 an hour.

               We see Oswald and another man in the Texas School Book 
               Depository in 1963.  They are hauling and stacking school 
               textbooks - an obviously lower-level job for Oswald after 
               the map factory.  We cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed 
               off area, the window site, the cafeteria.

                         All I can find out about the Williams' 
                         is their tax returns are classified 
                         and that Bill Williams, a descendant 
                         of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has 
                         links through his family and United 
                         Fruit to the CIA and does classified 
                         work for Bell Helicopter which 
                         requires a security clearance - so 
                         what is Oswald, a defector, doing 
                         visiting his wife in his house?  
                         Williams has a relationship at Bell 
                         with General Walter Dornberger, 
                         another one of the Nazis we brought 
                         in after the War for our missile 
                         program.  He used slave labor to 
                         build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler 
                         before Bell needed him.

                                     JIM
                         I wonder about the Williams'.  Just 
                         where did the first description of 
                         Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one 
                         knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, 
                         but his description came after 1 
                         P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's 
                         been tapping the Williams' and picks 
                         up a call between Bell Helicopter 
                         and Janet's phone, an unidentified 
                         voice saying "We both know who's 
                         responsible."  Who called?  Why's 
                         the Bureau been tapping them?

               We see the interior of the Williams' home in Irving on a day 
               in 1963.

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         His wife, Janet Williams, studied 
                         Russian in college and her father 
                         worked for the Agency for 
                         International Development, which 
                         works hand in hand with the CIA.  
                         She suddenly becomes Marina's best 
                         friend.  Marina fights often with 
                         Lee about many things - his secrecy, 
                         the lack of money.  She says Lee is 
                         not sexually adequate.  Lee hits her 
                         on several occasions.  Bill Williams' 
                         convenient separation from Janet 
                         allows Janet to invite Marina to 
                         move into her house in Irving.  There 
                         Marina and Lee have a second daughter - 
                         while Lee, now 24, stores his 
                         belongings in Janet's garage and 
                         rents a small room in Dallas under 
                         an alias of "O.H. Lee".

               We see Marina and Oswald in bed at night in the Williams' 
               house, in a tender scene.  Oswald says goodbye to his child.

               TIME CUT TO Oswald living in a boarding house.  It is at 
               night, and he sits in his room alone.  The housekeeper, 
               Earlene Roberts, heavyset, white, in her 60's, comes in and 
               asks him if he wants to watch some TV with her.  He declines.

                                     SUSIE
                         When he's arrested, Marina buries 
                         him with the public.  Her description 
                         of him is that of a psychotic and 
                         violent man.

               FLASHBACK TO Marina on TV, a different person from before.

                                     MARINA
                         I do not want to believe, but I have 
                         too much facts.. tell me that Lee 
                         shot Kennedy.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Yeah, after, they take her to Six 
                         Flags Inn in Arlington, prepare her 
                         for the interviews, teach her how 
                         she should answer - and after two 
                         months and 46 interviews, she has a 
                         nervous breakdown.
                              (flashback)
                         Oswald was no angel, that's clear, 
                         but who was he?

               BACK TO Antoine's Restaurant.

                                     BILL
                         I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying 
                         here?

                                     JIM
                         We're saying that when Oswald went 
                         to Russia, he was not a real defector, 
                         that he was an intelligence agent on 
                         some kind of mission for our 
                         government and he remained one till 
                         the day he died, that's what we're 
                         saying.

                                     BILL
                         And therefore because Oswald pulled 
                         the trigger, the intelligence 
                         community murdered their own commander 
                         in chief.  That's what you're saying!

                                     JIM
                         I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald 
                         didn't even pull the trigger, Bill.  
                         The nitrate test indicates he didn't 
                         even fire a rifle on November 22nd.  
                         And on top of that, they didn't even 
                         bother to check if the rifle had 
                         been fired that day.

                                     BILL
                         He had his palm print on the weapon.

                                     JIM
                         It went to the goddamn FBI and they 
                         didn't find a goddamn thing.  It 
                         comes back a week later and one guy 
                         in the Dallas police department 
                         suddenly finds a palm print which 
                         for all I know he could've taken off 
                         Oswald at the morgue.  There's no 
                         chain of evidence, Bill.  And what 
                         about the tow guns actually seen in 
                         the Depository?  One an Enfield 
                         photographed by a newsman and the 
                         other a Mauser, described by Deputy 
                         Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee 
                         Oswald was exactly what he said he 
                         was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at 
                         face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going 
                         with my gut here.  He's got an alias 
                         of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. 
                         Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's 
                         in a name, right?  In intelligence, 
                         they're assumed to be fake.  A name 
                         is sort of like a postbox number, a 
                         code - several different people can 
                         use the same name, right?  Then why 
                         can't somebody be using Oswald's 
                         name?

               We see blank faces around the table.

                                     BILL
                         But why?

                                     JIM
                         To frame him, obviously.  You got to 
                         get in your minds how the hell spooks 
                         think, Bill!  They're not ordinary 
                         crooks.

                                     LOU
                         I never could figure out why this 
                         guy orders a traceable weapon to 
                         that post office box when you can go 
                         into any store in Texas, give a phony 
                         name and walk out with a cheap rifle 
                         which can never be traced.

                                     JIM
                         Unless he or someone else wants him 
                         to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered 
                         the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did.  
                         It was picked up at the post office 
                         early morning when Oswald's time 
                         sheet shows him clocked in at his 
                         job.  Lou, come alive.  These things 
                         are not adding up.

                         I still have to question what the 
                         legal basis is that supports this, 
                         boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, 
                         but...

                                     JIM
                         Let's start making some assumptions 
                         about the man.  Why would he leave a 
                         path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's?  
                         This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, 
                         it is a very wide one.  Who found 
                         the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, 
                         Bill, Susie, I want you to go back 
                         and check all the sightings of Oswald 
                         in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in 
                         the summer and fall of '63 - see if 
                         it's the same guy.

                                     AL
                         Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds 
                         like James Bond now.

                                     JIM
                         Al, you can't tell a mink from a 
                         coonskin unless you see the fur up 
                         close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't 
                         start reading between the lines here!  
                         Y'all gotta start thinking on a 
                         different level - like the CIA does.  
                         We're through the looking glass.  
                         Here white is black and black is 
                         white.

                         There's a lot of smoke there, but 
                         there's some fire.

                         Now you guys, come on.  You're talking 
                         about the United States Government 
                         here!

                         We're talking about a crime, Bill.  
                         No one is above the law.  Reduce it.  
                         A crime was committed.  Let's get to 
                         work.

               MEDICAL UNIT - JAIL - DAY(1966)

               Jack Ruby, thick fudge of an angry face, flu-ridden, confronts 
               a doctor and two guards in his cell.

                                     RUBY
                         Christ, what the hell kinda needle 
                         is that?  I just got a cold for 
                         Chrissake.  I don't want any shot!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Please relax, Mr. Ruby.  This'll 
                         calm you down and clear this up.

                                     RUBY
                         Doc, I'm telling you, I don't need 
                         any shots.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Mr. Ruby, I don't want to involve 
                         the guards.  It'll just take a few 
                         seconds.

               Ruby looks over at the two guards, who eye him.  The Doctor 
               gives him the injection.

               FLASHBACK TO Ruby's jail cell in 1964.  Ruby talks to men 
               with their backs to us.  Lawyers and police clutter the cell, 
               making Ruby hyper-nervous.  The chief official's white hair 
               and avuncular voice are all we see and hear of him; his back 
               is to us.

                                     RUBY
                         Then do you understand that I cannot 
                         tell the truth here?  In Dallas.  
                         That there are people here who do 
                         not want me to tell the truth...  
                         who do not want me to have a retrial?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you 
                         can't tell us now.

               Ruby catches the stern face of Sheriff Bill Decker from the 
               corner of his eye, the Assistant D.A. next to him.

                                     RUBY
                         When are you going back to Washington, 
                         sir?

                                     OFFICIAL
                              (looks at watch)
                         I am going back very shortly after 
                         we finish this hearing - I am going 
                         to have some lunch.

                                     RUBY
                         Can I make a statement?  If you 
                         request me to go back to Washington 
                         with you right now, that is if you 
                         want to hear further testimony from 
                         me, can you do that?  Can you take 
                         me with you?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby.  
                         There are a good many things involved 
                         in that.

                                     RUBY
                         What are they?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         Well, the public attention it would 
                         attract.  And we have no place for 
                         you there to be safe, we're not law 
                         enforcement officials, and many things 
                         are at stake in this affair, Mr. 
                         Ruby.

                                     RUBY
                         But if I am eliminated there won't 
                         be any way of knowing.  Consequently 
                         a whole new form of government is 
                         going to take over this country, and 
                         I know I won't live to see you another 
                         time.  My life is in danger here.  
                         Do I sound screwy?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         Well I don't know what can be done, 
                         Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what 
                         you anticipate we will encounter.

                                     RUBY
                         Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. 
                         Chief Justice, you have a lost cause.  
                         All I want is a lie detector test, 
                         and you refuse to give it to me.  
                         Because as it stands now - and the 
                         truth serum - how do you pronounce 
                         it - Pentothal - whatever it is.  
                         They will not give it to me, because 
                         I want to tell the truth... And then 
                         I want to leave this world.

               The camera pauses on Ruby's face.  The men rise and leave in 
               the shadows.

               PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - (1967)

               Jack Ruby is escorted out of the infirmary, dead of cancer.

               BROUSSARD'S RESTAURANT - NEW ORLEANS - (1967)

               The puffy, smiling face of Dean Andrews, framed by huge black 
               glasses, talks in a Louisiana hippie argot of the 50's.  The 
               restaurant has a fancy French decor, mirrored walls, marble - 
               it serves the cream of Louisiana society.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Why you keep dancing on my head for, 
                         my man?  We been thicker'n molasses 
                         pie since law school.

                         Because you keep conning me, Dean.  
                         I read your testimony to the Warren 
                         Commission and...

                                     ANDREWS
                         There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two 
                         sides to every coin.

                                     JIM
                         You tell them the day after the 
                         assassination you were called on the 
                         phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and 
                         asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee 
                         Oswald's layer.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Right.

                                     JIM
                         Now that's pretty important, Dean.  
                         You also told the FBI when you met 
                         him, he was six foot two.  Then you 
                         tell the Commission he was five foot 
                         eight.  How the hell did the man 
                         shrink like that, Dean?

                                     ANDREWS
                         They put the heat on, my man, just 
                         like you're doing.  I gave'em anything 
                         that popped into my cabeza.  Truth 
                         is, I never met the dude.

               Sudden FLASHBACK to Andrews' office on a day in 1963.  Clay 
               Bertrand sits, back to us, talking to Andrews.  He has close-
               cropped white hair.  He is the same patrician man we've seen 
               earlier with Oswald on Canal Street and in Banister's office.  
               Andrews is evidently lying.

                                     ANDREWS
                         I don't know what the cat looks like 
                         and furthermore I don't know where 
                         he's at.  All I know is sometimes he 
                         sends me cases.  So one day he's on 
                         the phone talkin' to me about going 
                         to Dallas and repping Oswald...
                              (notices a woman, in 
                              present)
                         Hey, pipe the bimbo in red.  What 
                         ever happened to that little gal you 
                         was dating in the Quarter - from 
                         Opelousas, y'know, elevator didn't 
                         go to the top floor but tits could 
                         smother gumbo with.

               Jim, in present, looking briefly - a pretty girl walking in.

                         Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but 
                         not half as cute as you, Deano.  You 
                         shoulda tried a legitimate line of 
                         business.

                         in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good 
                         as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't 
                         it?

                         this Bertrand?

                              (bored)
                         Oh, I first heard these street cats 
                         jiving about him back in '56, '57 
                         when I lived down in the Quarter.

                                     JIM
                         Street cats?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young 
                         fags, you know.  They'd come into my 
                         bureau needing help, no bread, and 
                         I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, 
                         who gonna back you up?  These 
                         cornmuffins go to the phone and 
                         dial...

               FLASHBACK TO Andrews' office on another day in 1963.  We 
               catch a glimpse of a young swish sitting in Andrew's office 
               talking on the phone.  Andrews is also on the phone to 
               Bertrand, unseen, on the other end.

                                     ANDREWS
                         The dude on the other end says...

                         I'm Clay Bertrand.  Whatever they

                         how do I get in touch with you?

                                     CLAY BERTRAND
                         I'm around.

                                     ANDREWS (V.O.)
                         And that's how I first heard of Clay 
                         Bertrand.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         What was his voice like?

                                     ANDREWS
                         You knew you weren't talking to some 
                         low life fag, you know.  He had 
                         command of the king's English.

                                     JIM
                         Did he pay?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish 
                         I had a million of those bimbettes.

                                     JIM
                         And Oswald?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (just a slight 
                              hesitation)
                         Like I told to the Washington boys, 
                         Bertrand called that summer and asked 
                         me to help the kid upgrade his Marine 
                         discharge...

                                     JIM
                         So you saw Oswald how many times?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Three, four.  He came in with a few 
                         Cubano swishes one time I remember...

               FLASHBACK TO a third day at Andrew's office in 1963.  Oswald 
               is in the office with two young boys.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Recall any names?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (in present)
                         Mario, Jose - they wear names like 
                         you and I wear clothes.  Today the 
                         name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie.  
                         I wish I could help you, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (knee-jerk reaction)
                         Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat 
                         right off, this isn't my scene, man.  
                         I deal with muni court, I'm a hack 
                         in nigger town, that kid needs a hot 
                         dog.

                                     JIM
                         Then how the hell did you get in the 
                         Warren Commission, Dean?  Except 
                         through the phone records in the 
                         Dallas jail?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (nervous moment)
                         There were no phone records.

                                     JIM
                         Of course there weren't. 'Cause they 
                         disappeared.  And yet the Commission 
                         found you, Dean.

                                     ANDREWS
                         I don't know how they got to me.  
                         Maybe cause I repped him here.  The 
                         Feebees run background checks.  On 
                         my mama's breasts, man, that's all I 
                         got.
                              (pauses, adjusts)
                         There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If 
                         there were, why the hell didn't Bobby 
                         Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney 
                         General, he was his brother for 
                         Chrissake.  How the fuck three people 
                         could keep a secret like that, I 
                         don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was 
                         a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated 
                         this country.

               As Andrews resumes eating his crabmeat Louie with gusto, Jim 
               reaches over and grabs the fork in mid-air.

                                     JIM
                         Dean, I think we're having a 
                         communication problem.  I know you 
                         know who Clay Bertrand is.  Now stop 
                         eating that damn crabmeat for a minute 
                         and listen.
                              (gets Dean's attention)
                         I'm aware of our long friendship, 
                         but I want you to know I'm going to 
                         call you in front of a grand jury.  
                         I took nine judges on, Deano, right 
                         here in New Orleans, and I beat 'em 
                         all.  If you lie to the grand jury 
                         as you've been lying to me, I'm going 
                         to charge you with perjury.  Now, am 
                         I communicating with you?

               Andrews puts down the fork, shaken, silent for a moment.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Is this off the record, Daddy-o?
                              (Jim nods)
                         In that case, let me sum it up for 
                         you real quick.  If I answer that 
                         question you keep asking me, if I 
                         give you the name of the "Big 
                         Enchilada", y'know, then it's bon 
                         voyage, Deano - I mean like permanent.  
                         I mean like a bullet in my head.  
                         You dig?  Does that help you see my 
                         problem a little better?  You're a 
                         mouse fighting a gorilla.  Kennedy's 
                         dead as that crab meat.  The 
                         government's still breathing.  You 
                         want to line up with a dead man?

               At a nearby table, a waiter has just poured brandy on Crepe 
               Suzettes.  A blue flame hovers in the air as Jim leans forward 
               across the table, speaking deliberately.

                                     JIM
                         Read my lips, Deano.  Either you 
                         dance into the Grand Jury with the 
                         real identity of Clay Bertrand or 
                         your fat behind is going to the 
                         slammer.  Do you dig me?

               Andrews stands suddenly.

                                     ANDREWS
                         You're just as crazy as your mama.  
                         Goes to show it's in the genes!  Do 
                         you have any idea what you're getting 
                         into, my man?  You think Jack Ruby 
                         just up and died of cancer in four 
                         weeks after he gets a retrial?  That's 
                         some kinda new cancer - I'd say that's 
                         a "going out of business cancer".  
                         You got the right ta-ta, but the 
                         wrong ho-ho.  The government's gonna 
                         jump all over your head, Jimbo, and 
                         go "cock-a-doodledoo!"

               Andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles 
               out.  Jim now feels closer to the truth than ever.

               ANGOLA PRISON - LOUISIANA COUNTRYSIDE - (1967)

               From the point of view of an approaching car, the prison 
               looms over the swamp, dogs patrolling the wire.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         District Attorney Garrison to see 
                         Prisoner 5388, Ward Block 237B.

                                     GUARD'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Send him on in.

               PRISON DORMITORY - (1967)

               A chief guard walks Jim and Bill into a circus-like 
               atmosphere.  In Louisiana the prisoners can wear any outfit 
               they choose, which makes this prison look like Mardi Gras.  
               There are many transvestites.

                                     GUARD
                              (with evident pride)
                         ...we don't need no gates out there, 
                         sir, we got the "swamp".  Many of 
                         'em gone in there but none come out... 
                         Hey, Willie!

               Willie O'Keefe, a handsome, muscled, young chickenhawk with 
               an earring, bandana, colorful clothes, an aura of burned 
               truth in his intense, staring brown eyes and thick country 
               accent, sashays over.

                                     GUARD
                         You got some company, wants to talk 
                         wid you.  You behave now, boy, y'hear.

               TIMECUT TO the prison work area, where Willie talks, leaning 
               against a tree looking out on a mangrove swamp.  It's lunch 
               break and other prisoners move in the background, eating, 
               socializing.

                                     JIM
                         I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, 
                         for this time.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' 
                         but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, 
                         hours, days, years of'em.  Time just 
                         stands still here like a snake sunnin' 
                         itself in the road...

                                     BILL
                         Clay Bertrand, Willie?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in 
                         June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar.  
                         Dave Ferrie took me there, for the 
                         express reason to meet him.

                                     JIM
                         For sexual purposes?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Well... yeah.

               FLASHBACK TO the Masquerade Bar in the French Quarter.  It's 
               nighttime and Ferrie, Bertrand and O'Keefe sit at a back 
               booth.  Bertrand, as seen earlier, is an imposing, white-
               haired patrician man, over six feet tall, heavily defined 
               bones and eyelids, in his late 40's or early 50's.

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         Did he pay you for this?

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, 
                         it's no secret.  That's what I'm 
                         here for.

               They rise to leave.  Bertrand with a slight limp.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Anything else unusual about him you'd 
                         be able to describe in a court of 
                         law, Willie?

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         I remember he had some kinda thing 
                         wrong with his left leg.  He limped.  
                         Don't get me wrong, he's not one of 
                         those, you know, limp wrists.  He's 
                         a butch John.  You'd meet him on the 
                         street, you'd never snap.  You could 
                         go fishing with him, play poker with 
                         him, you'd never snap in a million 
                         years.  So one night we were over at 
                         Ferrie's place.  Having a party.  
                         Sometime in the late summer of '63.

               FLASHBACK TO Dave Ferrie's apartment on a night in 1963.  
               The place is filled messy bricabrac, including two dozen 
               mouse cages for Ferrie's cancer experiments.  Ferrie, 
               Bertrand, O'Keefe, and four Cubans in battle fatigues are 
               laughing and fooling around.  Oswald is in a corner cleaning 
               a .22 rifle with a scope on it.  He looks different, unkempt, 
               unshaven.  A record player grinds out a speech in Spanish by 
               Castro.  Some other people are there as well - it's a beatnik 
               scene: sandals, hanging out, only one woman.  Ferrie is taking 
               pictures throughout of the group horsing around, photographing 
               Oswald.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         ...there were about nine or ten 
                         people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing 
                         some stuff in the bush with him.  
                         Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a 
                         mess,
                              (laughs)
                         Y'know he had all those mice cages 
                         around cause he's working on this 
                         cure for cancer... Dave's smart -
                         real smart - speaks five languages, 
                         knows philosophy, medicine, military 
                         history, politics.  He wanted to be 
                         a priest but they defrocked him 'cause 
                         he was queer...

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         And that's where you met Oswald for 
                         the first time?

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced 
                         him as...

                                     FERRIE
                         Willie, say hello to Leon Oswald.

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (over the racket)
                         How ya doing?

                                     OSWALD
                              (sullen, to Ferrie)
                         What the fuck's he doing here?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Fuck you, man.

               Ferrie separates them.  Oswald seems to resent an outsider 
               being there.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to O'Keefe)
                         Leon's in a bad mood, don't get 
                         excited, he's all right.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Would you say this "Leon" was actually 
                         Lee Harvey Oswald?

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (in present)
                         Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in 
                         jail.  I got no reason to lie to 
                         you.  I ain't no nigger.

                                     BILL
                         Go on, Willie.

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (present merging to 
                              past)
                         ...well the party got crazier and 
                         crazier, one of those, y'know 
                         "beatnik" type things.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to O'Keefe)
                         We're having a little meeting here.
                              (indicates the second 
                              player)
                         That's Castro.  Sounds like Hitler 
                         doesn't he?  Sonofabitch is going to 
                         go.  Real soon.

                                     CUBANS
                         Muerte a Fidel!  Muerte!

                                     BERTRAND
                              (irritated at the 
                              noise)
                         Oh, stop it already!  What are all 
                         these people doing here anyway?  I 
                         can't bear all this infernal noise.

                                     FERRIE
                         Clara, don't be so sensitive.

                                     BERTRAND
                         I didn't come here for a pep rally.  
                         Get all this riffraff out of here.

                                     FERRIE
                         Okay, okay.

               TIMECUT TO later that night, when only O'Keefe, Ferrie, 
               Bertrand, Oswald and three Cubans are left.

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         ...finally they got out of there and 
                         I found myself alone with Dave and 
                         this Leon, two of the Cubans, and 
                         this guy Bertrand.  Dave pulled out 
                         his clippings which he was always 
                         carrying around.  He'd been obsessed 
                         with Castro and Kennedy for months 
                         and he started in again...

                                     FERRIE
                              (waving a clipping, 
                              drunk)
                         Kennedy fucked us in '61, '62, and 
                         he's fuckin' us now!  And that fuckin' 
                         zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee!  
                         The nerve of that little asswipe 
                         closing the camps.  Took all our C-
                         4!  Took ten thousand rounds, 3,000 
                         pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons.  
                         Next we'll be living in a world where 
                         only the cocksucking Reds will have 
                         all the weapons and we'll be 
                         surrounded.  If we want a free Cuba, 
                         we gotta whack out the fucking beard.

                                     CUBAN
                         That faggot Kennedy won't let us.  
                         Our hands are empty - how can we 
                         kill him?

                                     BERTRAND
                              (moving with a drink, 
                              walks with a slight 
                              limp)
                         It's a real problem getting at him.  
                         Castro's got informers on every block.

                                     FERRIE
                              (pointing to a map of 
                              Cuba on the wall)
                         Bullshit!  There's all kinds of new 
                         stuff.  I heard about rockets in an 
                         umbrella - they're tested at Fort 
                         Detrick?  I can show you a dozen 
                         poisons.  Stick it in his food, he'll 
                         die in three days, no trace.  We can 
                         put something in his beard, make it 
                         fall out, he'll look fuckin' 
                         ridiculous without his beard.

                                     CUBAN
                              (drunk)
                         Why don't we just take care of the 
                         main problem?  Which is that piece 
                         of shit Kennedy.  He's doing all 
                         kinds of deals!  Kissing Khrushchev's 
                         ass.  I wouldn't even call him 
                         President Kennedy.

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         ...then the Cubans left and the 
                         bullshitting was going on, Dave was 
                         drunk, really drunk and he starts in 
                         with Kennedy again.

                                     FERRIE
                         See, what Kennedy done, with him you 
                         should take a knife and stab and 
                         kill the fucker where he is now.  I 
                         mean it.  This is true.  But I tell 
                         you something.  I hope I get a week's 
                         notice.  I'll kill.  Right in the 
                         fuckin' White House.  Somebody's got 
                         to get rid of this fucker.

               Oswald looks up, listens quietly.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Oh, c'mon, Dave, you're never gonna 
                         get that sonofabitch.

                                     FERRIE
                         No?  It won't be long, mark my words.  
                         That fucker'll get what's coming to 
                         him.  And it can be blamed on Castro.  
                         Then the whole country'll want to 
                         invade Cuba.  All we got to do is 
                         get Kennedy in the open.

               Bertrand with his arms around O'Keefe, laughs, tries to change 
               the subject.

                                     BERTRAND
                         David, David, always some harebrained 
                         scheme or another... Oh?  What do I 
                         see here?  Oooooh, let's have some 
                         more champagne, shall we!

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (interested in Ferrie's 
                              proposal)
                         What about the Secret Service, the 
                         cops?

                                     FERRIE
                              (pacing, hyper)
                         No problem if it's planned right.  
                         Look how close they got with de 
                         Gaulle.  Eisenhower was always riding 
                         around in an open top.  I know 
                         somebody who actually went up and 
                         touched Eisenhower once.  We need to 
                         have three mechanics at three 
                         different locations.  An office 
                         building with a high-powered rifle.  
                         Triangulation of crossfire is the 
                         key.  You get the diversionary shot 
                         gets the Secret Service looking one 
                         way - Boom!  You get the kill shot.  
                         The crucial thing is one man has to 
                         be sacrificed, then in the commotion 
                         of the crowd the job gets done and 
                         the others fly out of the country to 
                         someplace with no extradition.  I 
                         could do that myself.  I could fly 
                         to Mexico, and then Brazil.

               Oswald listens, playing with his rifle.  Bertrand suddenly 
               turns cold, flashing a look at Ferrie.

                                     BERTRAND
                         Why don't we drop this subject... 
                         it's one thing to engage in badinage 
                         with these youngsters, but this sort 
                         of thing could be so easily 
                         misunderstood.
                              (he squeezes Ferrie)

                                     FERRIE
                         Ouch!

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         I didn't think much about it at the 
                         time.  Just bullshit, y'know, 
                         everybody likes to make themselves 
                         out to be something more than they 
                         are.  Specially in the homosexual 
                         underworld.  But then when they got 
                         him
                              (merging to the present)
                         I got real scared, y'know.  Real 
                         scared.  And that's when I got popped.

               BACK TO the prison work area.  Jim and O'Keefe continue 
               talking.

                                     JIM
                         Willie, are you willing to repeat 
                         your statements under sodium 
                         pentothal?  Under the supervision of

                         Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you 
                         can tell'em all I told you so.

                         You realize the things you're saying, 
                         Willie, are going to be attacked by 
                         a lot of different people.

                         Bring on all the motherfuckers!  
                         Bring their college degrees in here!  
                         I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't 
                         buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't 
                         even need the parole.  This is about 
                         the truth coming out.  You're a 
                         goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you 
                         don't know shit, cause you never 
                         been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is 
                         here now, Facism is...

                         It's important to know why you're 
                         telling us this.

                         You wanna know why?  'Cause that 
                         mother fucker Kennedy stole that 
                         fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon 
                         was gonna be one of the great 
                         Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this 
                         fuckin' country.  Got niggers all 
                         over the fuckin' place asking for 
                         their rights, where do you think we 
                         got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause 
                         Kennedy promised 'em too damned much.  
                         Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming 
                         back.  I tell ya this - the day that 
                         Communist sumbitch died was a great 
                         day for this country.  I jes' hate 
                         to think they're blaming it on some 
                         silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know 
                         shit anyway.  People should know why 
                         that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he 
                         was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, 
                         go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn 
                         story, I'm proud of it, don't matter 
                         fuck all to me, things don't change.

               As he talks, Jim shares a sickened look with Bill.  Whatever 
               truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an 
               attitude that could be destroyed in court.

               GARRISON HOME - NIGHT(1967)

               Jim, Lou, Al, Susie, and Numa sit around the table having an 
               after hours conference.  The kids run in and out of the room, 
               playing.  Susie is doing the talking, showing new paperwork 
               and photos.

                                     SUSIE
                         Your hunch was right, boss, but it's 
                         even spookier than we thought.  
                         Starting in September '63 on, two 
                         months before the assassination, 
                         there are sightings of Oswald all 
                         over Dallas, buying ammunition, 
                         getting a telescopic sight fixed, 
                         going to rifle ranges... Early 
                         November, a Dallas downtown Lincoln-
                         Mercury dealership where he tells 
                         the salesman Albert Bogard...

               FLASHBACK TO the Lincoln-Mercury dealership.  Oswald is 
               deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots - a mystery 
               figure.  He kicks the tires on a used red Mercury Comet, 
               cocky.

                                         "OSWALD"

               Let's take it out for a test drive.

               The salesman, Bogard, is hesitant.  "Oswald" doesn't look 
               like he's got a dime to his name.

                                         "OSWALD"

                                     (SENSING BOGARD'S HESITANCY)
                         Hey, I got a lotta money coming in 
                         the next two weeks.

               In the next scene we see the car, driven by "Oswald", zooming 
               up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway.

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         ...despite the fact he has no license 
                         and from what marina says, does not 
                         know how to drive, he hits the curves 
                         like Mario Andretti at the Indy 500.  
                         Bogard later told his boss he drove 
                         "like a madman."

               Resume the scene at the dealership.

                                     BOGARD
                         Three hundred bucks down, Mr. Oswald, 
                         you can drive outta here with it.

               "Oswald", unhappy, starts to leave.

                                     "OSWALD"
                         Who you kidding!  For this heap?  
                         Forget it...  No honest working man 
                         can afford a car anymore in the 
                         goddamn country!  Maybe I'll have to 
                         go back to Russia to buy a car...

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         ... really dumb dialogue like he's 
                         trying to draw attention to himself.  
                         A real moron.  He walks out.  The 
                         salesman remembers him as about 5'7", 
                         but we know from his draft card he 
                         was about 5'11"...

                                     LOU
                         ...several witnesses see him on 
                         several separate days at different 
                         firing ranges.

               FLASHBACK TO a Dallas firing range in 1963.

                                     LOU
                         ...one time, November 9, he decides 
                         he needs to practice on the target 
                         of the guy next to him.  Says 
                         something really dumb to the guy, 
                         who says Oswald was a great shot.

                                     MAN
                         Hey, watcha doing, boy... that's my 
                         target.

                                     "OSWALD"
                         Hey, sorry, buddy.  I just thought 
                         it was that sonofabitch Kennedy, 
                         y'know.  I couldn't help myself.

                              (in present)
                         ...about as subtle as a cockroach 
                         crawling across a white rug.

                         I'll go you one better, Lou.  He 
                         shows up at Silvia Odio's, a Cuban 
                         lady in Dallas working in the anti-
                         Castro underground - remember that 
                         name, a solid witness.  The two Cubans 
                         introduce him as "Leon Oswald".

               FLASHBACK TO the corridor of Silvia Odio's apartment in Dallas 
               on a night in 1963.  Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is 
               "the Bull", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we 
               saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, "the Indian", 
               is quiet and cold.  The men ring the doorbell and talk to a 
               concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the 
               shadows.  The men give her intimate information about her 
               father, who is imprisoned in Cuba.  The men chatter ad lib 
               in Spanish.

                                     SUSIE
                         ...the Cubans want Silvia, whose 
                         parents are political prisoners in 
                         Cuba, to help them raise money to 
                         assassinate Castro.  Something about 
                         the men bothers her.  She tells them 
                         she doesn't want anything to do with 
                         violence... about 48 hours later one 
                         of the Cubans calls her back...

               We see a shot of Silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut 
               with a shot of "the Bull" in a gas station phone booth, on a 
               night in 1963.

                                     THE BULL
                              (on the phone, in 
                              Spanish)
                         This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's 
                         kinda nut...  he told us we don't 
                         any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy 
                         should've been whacked after the Bay 
                         of Pigs, and some Cubans should've 
                         done that, it's easy to do, he says -
                         you know he's a Marine, an expert 
                         shooter...

               Silvia Odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered.  
               "The Bull's" eyes are on "Oswaldo", outside the booth with 
               "the Indian".  They're hanging out, talking to a mystery 
               man, an Anglo.

                                     SUSIE
                         It's like he's giving her information 
                         she doesn't even ask for.  She's 
                         scared, doesn't see them again till 
                         she sees Oswald's picture in the 
                         paper.  But the Warren Commission 
                         says she has bad eyesight because 
                         they have Oswald in Mexico at this 
                         time, trying to get back into Cuba.  
                         The Cubans think he's a double agent 
                         so they won't take him.  The CIA has 
                         a camera outside the Cuban Embassy 
                         and says this is Oswald in Mexico.
                              (hands over a picture)
                         You figure it.

               Jim looks at the famous photo... the camera closes in on a 
               heavyset man who looks nothing like Oswald.  Liz has come 
               back in and overhears.

                                     AL
                         If this is Oswald, it must be our 
                         third Oswald.

                                     JIM
                         The interesting thing is the extent 
                         to which the Warren Commission went 
                         to make him a Communist.  They got 
                         almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of 
                         the report on this Mexico trip and 
                         the picture doesn't even match.  I'm 
                         beginning to think the point of the 
                         Mexican episode was to lay the blame 
                         at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or 
                         someone purporting to be Oswald, had 
                         gotten into Cuba, come back, then 
                         killed the President, the American 
                         public once again would've screamed 
                         for a Cuban invasion...

               Susie picks up the famous Life magazine cover shot of Oswald 
               holding a rifle in his backyard.

                         I even have doubts about this photo, 
                         boss.  It pretty much convicted Oswald 
                         in the public mind.  Well, according 
                         to Captain Fritz, Oswald told him 
                         during his interrogation the photo 
                         was fake.

               FLASHBACK TO the Dallas Homicide Office in 1963.  Oswald is 
               being interrogated by Will Fritz, Dallas Homicide Chief, who 
               shows him the original of the photo from the Williams garage.

                                     OSWALD
                         That's not me.

                                     FRITZ
                         It came from Janet William's garage.

                                     OSWALD
                         Well, I never saw that picture.  It 
                         is my face, but my face has been 
                         super-imposed - the rest of the 
                         picture is not me at all.  I've done 
                         a lot of photographic work, and that 
                         picture was made by someone else.

                                     FRITZ
                         So who the hell are you?  Alex Hidell 
                         or Oswald?

                                     OSWALD
                         Well, you're the policeman, you work 
                         it out.

                              (in the present)
                         Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles-
                         Stovall, did know spy photography 
                         pretty well.  I took this picture to 
                         two experts.  Look at the way the 
                         shadows on the nose fall in a straight 
                         line like it's high noon.  But the 
                         shadow here on the ground reads like 
                         late afternoon or early morning.  
                         It's not the same time.  Also look 
                         at the crop marks across the chin.  
                         It seems like his head is pasted on 
                         somebody else's body implicating him 
                         with this rifle and gun.

               We see a blowup of the photo - the shadows, the crop mark.

                         And of the two newspapers in his 
                         hands, one is Leninist, the other 
                         Trotskyite.  Any genuine Socialist 
                         would know they hate each other's 
                         politics!

               FRENCH QUARTER - SAME NIGHT(1967)

               Broussard walks past a jazz wake leaving the cemetery - black 
               flambeurs carry torches, people sing "When the Saints Go 
               Marching in".  Bill is with a local gambler type.

                         Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He 
                         comes around the Quarter.

                         Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every

                         who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, 
                         even if you're family.  He's a big 
                         shot businessman.  I seen him on the 
                         TV news a lot with all the other big 
                         shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by 
                         another name down here.

                         Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy 
                         who used to run the International

                         So why does he call himself Bertrand?

                         ...now it gets positively spooky.  
                         In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, 
                         at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when 
                         the Oswald we know is in Russia - 
                         there is a man using the name "Oswald" 
                         to buy trucks for the Friends of 
                         Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never 
                         saw him again, but guess who's on 
                         the articles of incorporation of the 
                         Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy 
                         Banister.
                              (reactions from the 
                              others)
                         Banister has someone using the name 
                         "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, 
                         at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 
                         1960, that there could be someone 
                         using Oswald's passport and identity.

                                     JIM
                         Goddamn!  They put Oswald together 
                         from Day One!  Like some dummy 
                         corporation in the Bahamas - you 
                         just move him around a board.  Sent 
                         him to Russia, in and out, no passport 
                         problems.  You got the word 
                         "microdots" in his notebook, you got 
                         the Minox camera and the electronic 
                         devices they find in his possessions, 
                         the sealed DIZ201 personnel file.  
                         For all we know, there could be a 
                         dozen Oswalds in different cities, 
                         countries - all of them leaving a 
                         trail of incriminating evidence that 
                         could easily be traced to a scapegoat 
                         after the assassination.  Does the 
                         real Oswald know he's been put 
                         together?  Who knows.  It doesn't 
                         matter, does it?  He's a low level 
                         spy, he doesn't know who he really 
                         works for...

                         him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much 
                         for the city with all that restoration 
                         in the Quarter.  He's well connected,

                         I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A 
                         quiet little chat between gentlemen.

               GARRISON'S LIVING ROOM - EASTER SUNDAY(1967)

               The TV is on to the latest Vietnam Reports - combat footage.

                         In heavy fighting in Vietnam today, 
                         seven more American soldiers died 
                         and 23 were wounded.  The body count 
                         for this week now stands at 67 
                         Americans and 626 enemy soldiers 
                         killed in action.

               Liz plays with the kids looking for Easter eggs.  The dog is 
               barking - it's a scene of commotion.  Jim is getting ready 
               to go out.

                         your hands and knees and hunt for 
                         Jasper's Easter egg.

                         rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm 
                         interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.

                         President Johnson, meanwhile at an 
                         informal press conference, said he 
                         regretted that there is no end in 
                         sight to the war in Vietnam, where 
                         500,000 American troops are now 
                         fighting.  "We face more cost, more 
                         loss, and more agony."  In his 
                         proposal to raise taxes, Johnson...

                         But Jim, we're going to Antoine's 
                         with the kids - like we do every 
                         year.

                                     JIM
                         No.  I told you I was going to talk 
                         to Shaw.

                         But why in the Lord's name would you 
                         do it in the middle of Easter Sunday 
                         when you knew we were...

                         Because when I scheduled it I didn't 
                         realize it was a holiday.  You were 
                         there, why didn't you say something?

                         Look at the calendar, for Christ's 
                         sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter 
                         Sunday.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay 
                         Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.

                         Jim, and you don't even know it.  
                         The kids are missing out too.
                              (harder)
                         It's not just you making the sacrifice 
                         here, honey.

                                     JIM
                         Look, I'll rush and be there by two, 
                         I promise.  Go ahead without me.

               As he leaves, the camera holds on Liz.

               GARRISON OFFICE - (1967)

               Clay Shaw ("Bertrand"), in an elegant white summer suit, is 
               shown in.  Indeed, there is a slight limp to his gait which 
               Jim notices right away.

               He shares a look with Bill.  Susie is also in the room.  
               Shaw's rich bassoon voice drips with dialect.  Imperiously 
               smoking a Gaulois, Shaw has about him an air of authority 
               matched only by Jim's.

                                     CLAY SHAW
                         Mr. Garrison - what can I do for you 
                         on Easter Sunday?

                                     JIM
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, to interrupt 
                         this holiday, but I feel this is a 
                         conversation we might better have 
                         out of the everyday bustle in this 
                         office...

                                     SHAW
                              (sitting)
                         I'm not sure I understand.

                                     JIM
                              (bringing some papers 
                              forward)
                         Well... in an investigation we're 
                         conducting your name has come up a 
                         number of times.

                                     SHAW
                         I wouldn't imagine where.

                                     JIM
                         We recently talked to a number of 
                         men who claim to know you.  Are you 
                         acquainted with a David Logan?

                                     SHAW
                         No.  Never heard of him.

                                     JIM
                         A Perry Russo?

                                     SHAW
                         No.

                                     JIM
                         A Willie O'Keefe?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I don't believe I know anyone by 
                         that name.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at 
                         the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter 
                         and several evenings later you had 
                         him over for dinner at your apartment 
                         on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall 
                         that?

               FLASHBACK TO Clay's Dauphine Street residence, in the Quarter, 
               at night in 1962.  The butler opens the door and O'Keefe is 
               admitted to the townhouse.  Shaw appears behind the butler.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                              (in present)
                         Of course not.  I don't know this 
                         man.  Obviously then, I wouldn't 
                         have him to dinner.  Incidentally, I 
                         do not live in an apartment.  It's 
                         an 1860's house built by Gallier.  
                         I've restored it faithfully.  You 
                         know I am quite an advocate of 
                         restoration.

               At Shaw's house, dinner is served at a long table by the 
               black butler.  The table is decorated by a sumptuous setting 
               of silver and candelabra.

               Shaw uses a bell to summon the butler.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Perhaps a few more details about the 
                         evening will refresh your memory.  
                         Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served 
                         by a uniformed waiter - a colored 
                         man.  He particularly remembers that 
                         you sat at one end and he at the 
                         other - which he found rather unusual 
                         because the table was so long.  Does 
                         that bring back memories of Willie 
                         O'Keefe?

                                     SHAW
                              (in present)
                         Not at all.  But on the other hand, 
                         I do have a lovely Chippendale dining 
                         table and I often have a friend over 
                         sitting at one end while I sit at 
                         the other.  That is precisely the 
                         point of a long dining table.  The 
                         splendor of the meal adds to the 
                         enjoyment of it.

                                     JIM
                         I would imagine a uniformed waiter 
                         helps.

                                     SHAW
                         It adds a taste of elegance for which 
                         I must confess a weakness for now 
                         and then.  I call him Smedley.  His 
                         real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I 
                         could hardly imagine anything more 
                         uncouth during dinner than my turning 
                         toward the kitchen and hollering 
                         "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading 
                         to, Mr. Garrison?

               Willie O'Keefe and Clay Shaw leave the dining table.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         After dinner you paid him to have 
                         sex with you.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                              (laughing)
                         Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The 
                         Quarter is filled with vivid 
                         imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - 
                         grimy young hoodlums who'll say and 
                         do anything.  As you well know.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...in the course of that night, Mr. 
                         O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie 
                         stopped by the house... along with 
                         another young man...

               At Shaw's townhouse, we see Ferrie coming in, with another 
               young chicken.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                         Who?

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         David Ferrie.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                         No.  I have never known anyone by 
                         that name.  Of course never having 
                         met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have 
                         met Mr. Ferrie...

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...and that the four of you partied 
                         early into the morning hours...

               We see the four men in drag, smiling for the flash camera, 
               champagne bottles in hand.  Ferrie sniffs some poppers, then 
               shoves a popper in Shaw's face.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to Shaw)
                         You're mine, Mary.  Go get the fucking 
                         tools out, bitch.  Now!  I want some 
                         ass.

               Ferrie forces more poppers on Shaw.  The camera movies to 
               Shaw's bedroom, where Ferrie scatters a drawer full of leather 
               tools.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to Shaw)
                         Come here, bitch.
                              (Ferrie grabs Shaw by 
                              the hair)
                         You want this?  The only way you get 
                         this is do what I say.
                              (Ferrie whacks Shaw)
                         I'm the man.  Don't ever forget it.
                              (Shaw begs and whines)
                         You want it?  You want it?
                              (Ferrie spits on Shaw)
                         Fuck you and your rich friends.  
                         You're nothing but a rich whore!  
                         You're my woman!  Get the cat!
                              (to young man)
                         Strip!  Now, woman.  I want to see 
                         skin.

               BACK TO Garrison's office.

                                     JIM
                              (in present)
                         Let me show you his picture.
                              (he hands Shaw a 
                              general photo of 
                              Ferrie)

                                     SHAW
                              (in present)
                         No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone 
                         of such a bizarre appearance.

                                     JIM
                         Does the name Clay Bertrand mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     SHAW
                         Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I 
                         believe there was a man with a name 
                         similar to that who worked at the 
                         Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the 
                         man you had in mind?

                                     JIM
                         No, it was not.  Do you know an 
                         attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

                                     SHAW
                         One meets so many attorneys in my 
                         business.  No, I don't believe I 
                         know Dean Andrews.

               Jim is getting incredibly irritated.  He feels Shaw is lying.

               CUT TO Antoine's Restaurant, where Liz and all five kids 
               look at menus.

                                     SNAPPER
                         I'm hungry!  When're we gonna eat!

                                     LIZ
                         We're going to start without him and 
                         he'll be here for dessert.  Snapper, 
                         you put that back!

                                     VIRGINIA
                         I want a Shirley Temple!

                                     SNAPPER
                         Me, too.

                                     JASPER
                              (disappointed)
                         When's Daddy coming, Mama?

                                     LIZ
                         Soon.  He's real sorry he can't start 
                         with us but he's promised to be here.

               BACK TO Garrison's office later that day.  Everyone looks 
               tired as the questioning goes on.  Shaw sucks on endless 
               Gauloises.

                                     JIM
                              (handing a photo to 
                              Shaw)
                         Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?

                                     SHAW
                         Naturally.
                              (he looks up)
                         Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that 
                         Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

                                     JIM
                              (humorless)
                         Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald?

                                     SHAW
                         You really have me consorting with a 
                         cast of sordid characters, don't

                         Of course not!  Such a pity, that 
                         assassination.  In fact, I admired 
                         President Kennedy.  A man with true 
                         panache, and a wife with impeccable 
                         taste.

                         Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper 
                         article saying you were a member of 
                         the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale 
                         in Italy, that this company was a 
                         creature of the CIA for the transfer 
                         of funds in Italy for illegal 
                         political-espionage activities.  It 
                         says that this company was expelled 
                         from Italy for those activities.

                         I'm well aware of this asinine 
                         article.  And I am thinking very 
                         seriously of suing this rag of a 
                         newspaper.

                         It says that this company has heavily 
                         Fascist ties to the French secret 
                         army organization that tried to 
                         assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.

                         to the Schlumber tool company here 
                         in Houma, Louisiana - which is where

                         Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am 
                         an international businessman.  The 
                         Trade Mart which I founded is 
                         America's commercial pipeline to 
                         Latin America.  I trade everywhere.  
                         I am accused, as are all businessmen, 
                         of all things.  I somehow go about 
                         my business, make money, help society 
                         the best I can and try to promote 
                         free trade in this world.

                         contract agent with the Central 
                         Intelligence Agency?

               Shaw glares at him.  Silence.

                         And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you 
                         think I would be here today... talking 
                         to somebody like you?

                         No, people like you don't have to, I 
                         guess - people like you walk between 
                         the raindrops.

                         May I go?  Regardless of what you 
                         may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am 
                         a patriot first and foremost.

                         I've spent half my life in the United 
                         States military serving and defending 
                         this great country, Mr. Shaw, and 
                         you're the first person I ever met 
                         who considered it an act of patriotism 
                         to kill his own president.

                         out of line!

               Susie and Bill quiet Jim down.

                         late.  That's all the questions we 
                         have.  Thank you for your honesty

                         pleasant.  I wish to extend to each

                         went much longer than expected.

                         sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on 
                         my mind.

               Jim, is coming down the corridor with Broussard, is confronted 
               by some 20 local journalists and TV crew members.  We hear a 
               hubbub of fierce questioning - ad libs but Jim, puzzled, 
               brushes by, seeking refuge in his office.  Lou, Al, Numa and 
               Susie are all waiting for him.  The regular staff - some 30 
               people - are looking, wondering.  Lou presents him with the 
               front page of the New Orleans States-Item.

                         subject has raised some interesting 
                         questions.  With taxpayer money has 
                         he uncovered some valuable new 
                         evidence or is he merely saving the 
                         information which will gain for him 
                         exposure on a national level?  Mr. 
                         Garrison it seems, should have some 
                         explanation.

               The phone rings and Ivon picks it up.

                                     LOU
                         Yeah?

                                     DAVE FERRIE (V.O.)
                              (very agitated)
                         Did your office plant that garbage 
                         in the fucking paper?

                                     LOU
                         Who is this?

                                     FERRIE (V.O.)
                         You know damn well who it is.

                                     LOU
                         Dave?

                                     FERRIE (V.O.)
                         Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the 
                         only straight shooter in that fuckin' 
                         office, I'd like an answer from you.  
                         Did you plant it?

                                     LOU
                         Dave, do you think we're out of our 
                         minds?  The whole building's been a 
                         zoo since that broke.  We can't get 
                         a thing done.  Reporters crawling 
                         everywhere.  You think we want that?

               We see Ferrie in a phone booth on the street outside his 
               apartment house in the French Quarter.  He's a nervous wreck, 
               watching the reporters and TV cameras surrounding his place, 
               waiting for him.

                                     FERRIE
                              (yelling)
                         Somebody planted that fucking story!  
                         And somebody tipped off the press 
                         I'm one of Garrison's fucking 
                         suspects.  I can't go home.
                         I'm out on the street.  The maggots 
                         are everywhere!  Do you know what 
                         you've done to me?  It's all over 
                         the national news now.  You know 
                         what you've done to me?

                                     LOU
                         Calm down, Dave, what?

                                     FERRIE
                         I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe 
                         me, I'm a dead man.

                                     LOU
                         What are you talking about, Dave?  
                         You weren't mentioned in the story.  
                         Don't jump to conclusions.

                                     FERRIE
                         You think your investigation's been 
                         all that secret?  You know, when you 
                         talk to people, they talk to other 
                         people.

                                     LOU
                         What did they...

                                     FERRIE
                         You still questioning any Cubans?

                                     LOU
                         Dave, you know that's where this 
                         road leads.

                                     FERRIE
                         It leads farther than that.

                                     LOU
                         Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in 
                         the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 
                         minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved 
                         for you under an assumed name.

                                     FERRIE
                              (unsure)
                         The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?

                                     LOU
                              (hopeful)
                         Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our 
                         side.  I guarantee you the boss'll 
                         protect you...
                              (there's a long silence 
                              as Ferrie, torn, 
                              agonizes)
                         Dave?

                                     FERRIE
                              (dreamy)
                         ...give me protection?

                                     LOU
                         Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He 
                         likes you.  Your mind.

                                     FERRIE
                         I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet 
                         you in 20 minutes.

               Ferrie hangs up.  Pause.  At his end, Lou Ivon hangs up, 
               excited.

               GARRISON'S HOME - NIGHT(1967)

               The phone rings.  Liz picks it up.  Jim is watching the TV 
               news:  Martin Luther King is delivering a speech against the 
               Vietnam War.

                                     KING
                              (on TV)
                         President Kennedy said on one 
                         occasion, "Mankind must put an end 
                         to war, or war will put an end to 
                         mankind."  I pray God that America 
                         will hear this before it's too late, 
                         because today we're fighting a war 
                         I'm convinced is one of the most 
                         unjust wars that has ever been fought 
                         in the history of the world.

                                     LIZ
                              (on the phone 
                              meanwhile, testy)
                         No, he's not here now.  And he would 
                         not take calls here if he were!  So 
                         please call the office number.  Thank 
                         you.
                              (hangs up)
                         Two of them even had the gall to 
                         come to the door this afternoon, one 
                         all the way from England.

                                     JIM
                         Did they live?

                                     LIZ
                         It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

                                     JIM
                         Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, 
                         honey, I been through four years of 
                         war - this is nothing.

               The phone rings again.

                                     KING
                              (on TV)
                         ...sending them 8,000 miles away to 
                         guarantee liberties in Southeast 
                         Asia which they have not found in 
                         Southwest Georgia or East Harlem.  
                         So we have been repeatedly faced 
                         with the cruel irony of watching 
                         Negro and white boys on TV screens 
                         as they kill and die for a nation 
                         that has been unable to seat them 
                         together in the same school.

                                     LIZ
                         I haven't, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Nothing is going to happen to you.  
                         I won't let it.

                                     LIZ
                         Leave us ALONE for God's sake!
                              (recognizes the voice)
                         ...Oh, it's Lou.

               FONTAINBLEAU HOTEL SUITE - THAT NIGHT

               Jim and Lou watch as Ferrie paces wildly, speeding.

                                     FERRIE
                         I'm caught in the middle.  They're 
                         after me.  It's almost over.

                                     LOU
                         Listen, Dave, why don't we order 
                         some room service, have a bite, relax.  
                         I'll stay as long as you want.

                                     FERRIE
                         I don't know who to trust anymore.  
                         Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot 
                         coffee and a few packs of Camels.  
                         You got anything new in the 
                         investigation?

               As Lou picks up the phone and orders room service, Jim 
               answers.

                                     JIM
                         You mean about the Cubans getting 
                         trained north of the lake?

                                     FERRIE
                              (incoherent)
                         Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet 
                         project.  Getting paid by the 
                         government to work against the 
                         government.  Beautiful.  What a mind 
                         he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all 
                         those files.

                                     JIM
                         Who was paying you, Dave?

                                     FERRIE
                         You think I was a getaway pilot for 
                         the assassination, don't you?

                                     JIM
                         I don't know.  Were you?
                              (Dave laughs)
                         Who you scared of, Dave?

                                     FERRIE
                         Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob.  
                         The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans.  
                         Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, 
                         Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio 
                         del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew 
                         missions into Cuba - he's somewhere 
                         in Miami.  You're on the right track.

               Lou writes it down.  Seeing him writing makes Ferrie even 
               more paranoid.

                                     FERRIE
                         Hold it!  Hold it!  I'm not 
                         cooperating with anyone.  There's a 
                         death warrant for me, don't you get 
                         it?  Wait a minute.  You're not 
                         bugged, are you?

               He feels Lou for bugs, but out of a sense of hierarchy, 
               ignores Jim.  He checks around the room - the phone, behind 
               paintings, flower vase, light fixtures - as the batty 
               conversation continues:

                                     LOU
                         Dave, I always play square.  No bugs.  
                         I'd love you to go on the record, 
                         but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're 
                         ready.

                                     FERRIE
                              (checking the room)
                         I don't have much time.  They don't 
                         even need bugs anymore.  They got 
                         these fuckin' satellite waves.  They 
                         put a bug in a friend of mine when 
                         he was born, right up his nostrils, 
                         subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He 
                         was one of those products of a 
                         crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi 
                         rocket scientist father and a Commie 
                         spy mother.  You'd never believe 
                         half the shit the Agency does.
                              (holding his neck)
                         I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept 
                         since that shit article came out.  
                         Why'd you guys have to go and get me 
                         involved with this?

                                     LOU
                         Did we involve you, Dave, or did 
                         Clay Shaw?

                                     FERRIE
                         That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got 
                         me by the balls.

                                     LOU
                         What do you mean?

                                     FERRIE
                         Photographs - compromising stuff.  
                         And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays 
                         for keeps...
                              (checks the room for 
                              bugs)
                         I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil 
                         Air Patrol unit.  I taught him 
                         everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, 
                         nobody really liked him cause he was 
                         a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd 
                         talk about his kid, y'know, really 
                         wanted her to grow up with a chance, 
                         but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency 
                         fucked him.  Just like they're gonna 
                         fuck me.

                                     JIM
                         Let me get this straight, now.  Clay 
                         Shaw is blackmailing you?

                                     FERRIE
                         Fuckin' A.  How do you think the 
                         Agency gets people to do their 
                         bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got 
                         on Oswald!

               Room service knocks, and Ferrie jumps and rushes to the 
               bathroom.

                                     FERRIE
                         Who is it?

                                     BELLHOP (V.O.)
                         Room service.

               Jim whispers something and Lou goes to the door, takes the 
               service table without letting the bellhop in.  Jim, excited 
               but trying to stay even, continues with Ferrie.

                                     JIM
                         Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that 
                         was in Dallas, or was it an 
                         impersonator.

                                     FERRIE
                         Same one.  I didn't know no 
                         impersonator.

               FLASHBACK TO Ferrie at the party with Oswald (obscured) per 
               Willie O'Keefe's witness.  Jim, in the present, doesn't feel 
               right about it.

                                     JIM
                         Did you take a good look at the TV 
                         when they had Oswald?

                                     FERRIE
                              (shrugs, can't be 
                              bothered)
                         Black, black - just give it to me.
                              (takes the fresh coffee 
                              from Lou, lights a 
                              Camel)
                         Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is 
                         killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had 
                         it for years.  I been working with 
                         mice, y'know, trying to come up with 
                         a cure.

                                     JIM
                         Dave, can I just ask you this 
                         directly?  Did you ever work for the 
                         CIA?

                                     FERRIE
                              (laughs)
                         You make it sound like some remote 
                         fuckin' experience in ancient history.  
                         Man, you never leave the Agency.  
                         Once they got you, you're in for 
                         life.

                                     JIM
                         And Shaw?

                                     FERRIE
                         Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest 
                         clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans -

                                     FERRIE
                         Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in 
                         Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run 
                         guns to Castro when he was still on 
                         our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood.  
                         Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then 
                         we tried to whack him.  Everybody's 
                         flipping sides all the time.  It's 
                         fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

                                     LOU
                         What about the mob, Dave?  How do 
                         they figure in this?

                                     FERRIE
                         They're Agency, too.  Don't you get 
                         it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying 
                         to whack out the Beard.  Mutual 
                         interests.  They been doing it for 
                         years.  There's more to this than 
                         you dream.  FBI fucking hates the 
                         CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something 
                         to do with it too.  Check out "Alan 
                         Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood.  
                         Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The 
                         shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - 
                         the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard 
                         he shot his own partner.  Got that?

                         I know.  But the Agency always runs 
                         the show.  Check out something called

                         Then who killed the President?

                                     FERRIE
                         Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is 
                         too fuckin' big for you!  Who did 
                         Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in 
                         a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the 
                         shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't 
                         you get it yet?  I can't be talking 
                         like this.  They're gonna kill me.  
                         I'm gonna die!
                              (he sits down, 
                              cracking, sobbing)
                         I don't know what happened.  All I 
                         wanted in the world was to be a 
                         Catholic priest - live in a monastery, 
                         study ancient Latin manuscripts, 
                         pray, serve God.  But I had this one 
                         terrible, fatal weakness.  They 
                         defrocked me.  And then I started to 
                         lose everything.

               He bows his head, holding it in his hands, and his wig starts 
               to come off in his hands.

                                     FERRIE
                         Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' 
                         rug today.  You know, at one time I 
                         even had a full head of hair like 
                         everyone else.  And then I lost that.  
                         That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the 
                         bastard.  All I got left is in his 
                         rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the 
                         newspapers - I know it.  That's how 
                         the Agency works.  They use people, 
                         chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now 
                         it's my turn.

                              (empathetic)
                         Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just 
                         talk to us on the record and we'll 
                         protect you.  I guarantee it.

               There's a long silence.  Ferrie, spent, stares at Jim.  He's 
               about to crack, but...

                                     FERRIE
                         They'll get to you, too - they'll 
                         destroy you... They're untouchable, 
                         man...
                              (then)
                         I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see 
                         straight.

                                     JIM
                         Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel 
                         better in the morning.  We'll talk 
                         then.

                                     FERRIE
                         Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for 
                         awhile.  I got to make some calls.

               His eyes are going again.  Deals... intrigue - thru the tears.

                                     LOU
                         Whatever you say, Dave.  I'll be 
                         home.  Okay?

               Lou and Jim share a look.

               CORRIDOR OF GARRISON'S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER(1967)

               A mob scene.  Press from the U.S. and all over the world are 
               filling the corridor.  A French reporter tries to get past 
               the receptionist as Numa passes him with a stack of mail.  
               Also in the hall are many individual citizens who have come 
               to give tips and theories.  One of them is dressed as Satan 
               in a red jump suit with mask, horns, tail and a pitchfork.

               Jim is reading Newsweek, deeply hurt.  There are newspapers 
               all over his desk.

                                     JIM
                         Notorious is more like it.  "Jim 
                         Garrison is right.  There has been a 
                         conspiracy in New Orleans - but it's 
                         a plot of Garrison's own making"... 
                         and this - "one of the D.A.'s 
                         investigators offered an unwilling 
                         witness $3000 if only he would fill 
                         in the facts of the alleged meeting 
                         to plot the death of the President"... 
                         How can they write that?  Where did 
                         they come up with this? ...

                         "A charlatan," "power-mad," a "hulking

                         "Morbid Frolic in New Orleans."

               Bill has come in during this, completely frazzled.

                                     BILL
                         The crazies have taken over the 
                         asylum!  It's a zoo out there.

                         Sensational garbage sells newspapers, 
                         Jim.  What else is new?  Look at the 
                         thousands of letters you're getting.  
                         That's where the heart of the country 
                         is.
                              (reads from one)
                         "Dear Mr. Garrison, God bless you 
                         for having the courage to go after 
                         the murderers of President Kennedy.  
                         Please don't stop till they're behind 
                         bars.  I am a beautician here in 
                         Hannibal, Missouri, and my husband 
                         is a janitor in the local high school.  
                         We have four kids and not an extra 
                         lot of money but we enclose a 
                         contribution to help with your work.  
                         We are praying for you.  God bless, 
                         Judith Hardy, Hannibal, Missouri."

               Numa pulls a dollar bill from the envelope.

                                     NUMA
                         That's what it's about, boss.  For 
                         every lousy article in the press 
                         there's a hundred of these.

               Jim is moved.  Bill is not.

                                     BILL
                         That's fine, Numa, but what about 
                         all the people who aren't writing 
                         letters.  They're sitting home reading 
                         all these lies.  I just heard NBC 
                         crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - 
                         not on the Kennedy killing, but on 
                         us.  One of their top guys, Harry 
                         Stoner, is talking to everybody he 
                         can find about you, boss...

                                     JIM
                         Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he 
                         call me?

                                     NUMA
                              (to Bill)
                         What do you want to do, Bill - fold 
                         up and close the store?  You sound 
                         like it.

                                     BILL
                         Look, this is bigger than all of us.  
                         We can't try a case in this 
                         atmosphere.

               Sharon has come in during this, signalling to Jim.

                                     SHARON
                         Mr. Miller's been waiting.

                                     JIM
                              (remembering)
                         Oh!  Send him in.
                              (to Numa)
                         Denver oilman wants to support the 
                         investigation.
                              (specifically to Bill)
                         Bill, I know what you're thinking, 
                         but sometimes when it makes no sense 
                         that's exactly when you just gotta 
                         stick to it, head down.

               Sharon shows in Mr. Miller, the Denver oilman.  He's a self-
               assured, impressive man in his 50's with a western accent, 
               cowboy boots and hat, and a well-cut gabardine suit.

                                     JIM
                         Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison.  
                         Would you care for some coffee?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your 
                         coffee's almost Turkish down here 
                         but I could get used to it.

               Numa leaves.  Bill indicates he'd like to sit in.  Jim nods 
               okay.  Miller pays no attention to Bill.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm glad you could find time to see 
                         me.  I flew down from Denver this 
                         morning on my private jet.

                                     JIM
                         Yes, your letter indicated you were 
                         in he oil business up there.

                                     MILLER
                         I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. 
                         Garrison, but I have to admire someone 
                         like you - and I have the means to 
                         back up what I say.

                                     JIM
                         We can use all the support we can 
                         get.  I think these might interest 
                         you.

               Jim has gathered together a group of photos of the shooting.  
               Sharon bringing the coffee.

                                     JIM
                         They've been enlarged and show a lot 
                         of detail...

                                     MILLER
                         Splendid, love to see them.

               He glances at the photo but continues on across the room, 
               looking at the pictures on the walls.

                                     MILLER
                         Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?

                                     JIM
                         Germany.

                                     MILLER
                         You were lucky.  I spent three years 
                         in the Pacific.
                              (he looks out the 
                              blinds at Tulane 
                              Avenue)
                         I've never seen an avenue with such 
                         a profusion of bail-bonding companies.  
                         Why is that?

                                     JIM
                              (nettled by Miller's 
                              moving around)
                         I imagine because this is the Criminal 
                         District Court Building
                              (showing a photo)
                         This is an enlargement of a potential 
                         shooter standing behind the picket 
                         fence.  We...

               We see a blurry blowup of something behind the picket fence.  
               Miller takes the photo, glances at it and sits down.

                                     MILLER
                         I know about that shot.  A terrible 
                         tragedy.
                              (Puts the photo back 
                              on the desk)
                         How much do you have for carrying on 
                         your investigation?

                                     JIM
                         If you must know, virtually nothing.

                                     MILLER
                         How many men are working with you on 
                         this?

                                     JIM
                         Less than you would guess.  Most 
                         days two to three assistant D.A.'s.  
                         A handful of police investigators.

                                     MILLER
                         That's all you've had all this time?

                                     JIM
                         That's it.

               Jim expectant of some help.  A pause.  Then:

                                     MILLER
                         I admire you, Mr. Garrison.  How did 
                         you manage to make your way into Guy 
                         Banister's operation?

               The clock is ticking.  Jim shares a look with Bill.  The 
               cards are on the table.

                                     JIM
                         That was never in he newspapers, Mr. 
                         Miller.

               Miller smiles, stands, paces the room.  He continues to ignore 
               Bill completely.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm going to be very frank with you.  
                         You've done a great job, an astounding 
                         job considering the limited resources 
                         available to you.  But the best you 
                         can ever hope for is to stir up a 
                         lot of confusion.  You're not going 
                         to do this country any good, and 
                         you're not going to do yourself any 
                         good.
                              (he sits back down 
                              and looks directly 
                              at Jim)
                         You don't belong here.  On this Mickey 
                         Mouse street with that cheap strip 
                         of bail bond shops.

                                     JIM
                         The job manages to keep me pretty 
                         busy.

                                     MILLER
                         Nonsense.  You should be in a job 
                         where you can make decisions that 
                         have impact, affect the world.  Here 
                         you're trying to climb up the steep 
                         side of Mount Everest.

               He leans forward across Jim's desk, tapping his manicured 
               index finger on the desk.  Clearly visible to Jim and to us 
               (in a close-up) is Miller's Annapolis ring tapping.

                                     MILLER
                         I propose you accept an appointment 
                         to the bench in Federal District 
                         Court and move into a job worthy of 
                         your talent.
                              (he leans back and 
                              pauses)
                         Do you have any idea, do you have 
                         any conception of how easily such an 
                         appointment can be arranged?

                                     JIM
                         And what would I have to do?

                                     MILLER
                         Stop your investigation... it was a 
                         magnificent effort but it's over and 
                         done with.  The press is already on 
                         your behind and that's only the 
                         beginning, my boy, only the beginning.

                                     JIM
                         How long do you think it would take 
                         me to be appointed?

               Jim's eyes go to Bill.  He could be wrong, but it's almost 
               as if Bill were going along with the idea now.

                                     MILLER
                              (smiling, thinking 
                              Jim is hooked)
                         Well, ordinarily these things take a 
                         long time.  But in your case, with 
                         your record it can be expedited - 
                         easily.  I guarantee it.

               Jim leans back, puts his feet up on the corner of the desk, 
               waving them like fans.  Bill waits.

                                     JIM
                         Who are you, Mr. Miller?
                              (no answer - just the 
                              sound of the overhead 
                              fan)
                         You see that helmet over there?
                              (the Nazi helmet with 
                              a bullet hole on his 
                              desk)
                         I picked that up at the Dachau 
                         concentration camp when we liberated 
                         it in 1945.  It was the most 
                         horrifying sight I've ever seen, Mr.  
                         Miller.  Pyramids of decaying, 
                         stinking bones and skin one on top 
                         of the other.  I don't enjoy looking 
                         at that swastika every day, Mr. 
                         Miller, but I keep it there to remind 
                         me of what can happen when a country 
                         turns from free democratic principles 
                         to Fascism, when a few madmen turn 
                         human beings into digits and millions 
                         sit in silence and do nothing about 
                         it.

               Miller waits.  Bill waits.  Jim comes forward with his reply.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Miller, you and I have met under 
                         a great misunderstanding.  I haven't 
                         the remotest interest in becoming a 
                         Federal Judge.  And nothing is going 
                         to keep me from going ahead with my 
                         investigation of John Kennedy's 
                         murder.

               Miller's entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger 
               and danger.

                                     JIM
                         Bill, Mr. Miller and I have finished 
                         our conversation.  Would you show 
                         him out?

               Bill has a strange reaction - a sudden exhalation of breath 
               as if an entire house of cards were collapsing.  He rises, 
               but Miller goes first, leaving silently.  Once he's gone, 
               Bill turns wearily to Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Those bastards!  That's proof enough 
                         right there of what we're up against.  
                         The whole goddamn Federal Government, 
                         Bill!

                                     BILL
                         Well, they offered you the carrot, 
                         and you turned it down... you know 
                         what's coming next, don't you, boss?

               GARRISON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY(1967)

               The staff is assembled.  We see the headline in the Times-
               Picayune, which says: "FERRIE CALLS GARRISON PROBE A WITCH 
               HUNT."

                                     LOU
                         Boss, I tell you something or somebody 
                         is putting tremendous heat on David 
                         Ferrie.  If we sit on our behinds 
                         any longer, I don't think the guy's 
                         going to hold on.

                                     SUSIE
                              (raps the newspaper)
                         Look at this bullshit!  He keeps 
                         changing what he says.  We can't 
                         possibly call him to a Grand Jury.

                                     JIM
                         Susie, watch the language, would you 
                         please.

                                     AL
                         My instinct is that Ferrie is going 
                         to keep on deteriorating, and we'll 
                         end up getting more out of him when 
                         he finally cracks.  If we call him 
                         now, he might freeze up and we could 
                         lose the best shot we've ever had.

                                     LOU
                         You don't get it, guys - he can't go 
                         down any further.  We got to protect 
                         him full time.

                                     JIM
                              (rises, looks at his 
                              watch)
                         I have a plane to catch... going to 
                         Washington.  An interesting lead, 
                         says he's closely connected to these 
                         events, but he won't come down here...  
                         I know what you're going through 
                         with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk 
                         tomorrow.

                                     LOU
                         I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, 
                         Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta 
                         get him in, boss.  I need more men - 
                         I can't even pull the teams to watch 
                         Ferrie... This is our case!

               Numa rushes in with a young investigator, Williams - 
               displaying a miniature microphone.

                                     NUMA
                         HOLD IT, CHIEF...

                                     JIM
                              (to Lou)
                         You just need some sleep, Lou.  It 
                         won't look so bad when...

               Numa makes violent signals to shut up - not to talk - sticking 
               the microphone in front of Jim.  Williams searches the walls 
               for the bug.  Numa signals everyone outside.

                                     GARRISON'S MAIN OFFICE
                         The staff comes out into the office 
                         with Him, disturbed.

                                     JIM
                         What the hell is...

                                     NUMA
                         Williams found this in your office... 
                         We think the conference room is also 
                         bugged.  And maybe the phones.  The 
                         whole place needs debugging.

               The whole staff from the conference room reacts.  Jim looks 
               stunned.

                                     JIM
                         I don't believe it!

                                     SUSIE
                         Bugging the District Attorney's office 
                         of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!

               Sharon has been standing there trying to get Lou's attention.

                                     SHARON
                         It's urgent for you, Mr. Ivon.

               Lou goes to the phone.

                                     NUMA
                         Well, believe what you want, boss, 
                         but we got to be more careful.  All 
                         these new volunteers, any one of 
                         them could be...

                                     JIM
                         Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't 
                         have time for this nonsense.
                              (to the hidden mikes 
                              loudly)
                         We've obviously got the bastards 
                         worried now.  I'm going to Washington.

               Everyone laughs, but the camera goes to the look of shock on 
               Lou's face as he holds the receiver.  They all look over at 
               him; feeling the bad news before they hear it.

                                     LOU
                         Dave Ferrie's dead.  The body was 
                         found at his apartment two hours 
                         ago.

               Jim's look says "There goes the case."

               OUTSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT - FRENCH QUARTER(1967)

               Jim and his staff storm into the area, which is cordoned off 
               by police.

               Members of the press are all over, yelling questions at Jim.

                                     JIM
                              (to chief police 
                              officer)
                         This case is in our jurisdiction.  I 
                         don't want anyone from a Federal 
                         agency in here without an explicit 
                         Federal court order.  You got that, 
                         Hank?
                              (Hank looks at him 
                              weirdly)

                                     NEWSMAN 10
                         Was Ferrie murdered, Mr. Garrison?  
                         Do you have any leads?

               INSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT

               The apartment is filthy and sinister.  Hundreds of mice squeal 
               in their cages, upset by the invasion of men and light.  
               Nothing seems to have been washed in years.  There is an 
               accumulation of furniture, college pennants, photos of young 
               boys in training, books everywhere, ammunition, guns, a piano, 
               maps, fake college degrees on the walls.  Ferrie's naked 
               body lies on the couch with a sheet over it.  He is unwigged, 
               his eyebrows unpainted, false teeth next to him.  Jim studies 
               the corpse as the coroner comes alongside.

                                     JIM
                         What's it look like, Nick?

                                     CORONER
                         I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart 
                         attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks 
                         like natural causes.

               Jim picks several empty, capless medicine bottles on a table 
               next to the sofa and looks at them.  Lou and Bill come over 
               with a typed suicide note.

                                     BILL
                         It's addressed to no one and no 
                         signature.  "To leave this life is, 
                         for me, a sweet prospect.  I find 
                         nothing in it that is desirable and 
                         on the other hand, everything that 
                         is loathsome."

                                     LOU
                         Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

               The words from the note hang there weirdly, as Jim paces on 
               into the apartment, one of them medicine bottles in his hand.  
               The music grows, and a sinister feel of danger and death 
               pervades the atmosphere.  Then the sounds drop away.

                                     FERRIE'S BEDROOM
                         Jim hands Lou the medicine bottle.

                                     LOU
                         Proloid?

                                     JIM
                         I took it once for a low thyroid 
                         condition...
                              (he walks away)
                         It raises the metabolism, Lou.
                              (pause)
                         Did David Ferrie strike you as the 
                         kind of person who had a low 
                         metabolism?

                                     LOU
                         I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

               CLOSET IN FERRIE'S APARTMENT

               Jim runs an eye through Dave's closet, cluttered with shabby 
               jackets.

               His eye falls on a neat but faded lace and satin, some sort 
               of garment of priestly origin, he takes it in his hand.

                                     JIM
                         Ferrie was the only one to express 
                         some kind of remorse about this whole 
                         thing.  I think it got him killed.

               Susie Cox walks in, a new message written on her face.

                                     SUSIE
                         Boss, we just got bad news from Miami.  
                         They found Ferrie's Cuban friend - 
                         Eladio del Valle - this morning, 
                         hacked to death with a machete in 
                         his car.  He was tortured, shot in 
                         the heart at point-blank range and 
                         his skull was split open with an 
                         axe...

                                     LOU
                         Jesus - if that ain't the Devil's 
                         piss!  Those bastards!

               Jim's mood darkens, and he heads back into the living room 
               as Ferrie's corpse is being trundled out the door.  The 
               sickness is everywhere; an oppressive mood.  Bill comes up.

                                     BILL
                         Found another note, same thing, no 
                         name, no signature.  "When you receive 
                         this, I will be quite dead, so no 
                         answer will be possible.  I offered 
                         you love.  All I got in return in 
                         the end was a kick in the teeth."

                                     JIM
                         Jesus, they must've been hard pressed 
                         to come up with that one.

               Jim, feeling ill, wanting to leave, stops the coroner before 
               he exits...

                                     JIM
                              (gives the coroner 
                              the empty bottle)
                         Nick, what would happen if a man 
                         suffering from hypertension were to 
                         take an entire bottle of Proloid?

                                     CORONER
                         He'd die pretty quick, either a heart 
                         storm or a ruptured blood vessel in 
                         the brain.

                                     JIM
                         Can you ascertain if there's Proloid 
                         in his system?

                                     CORONER
                         Not in a routine autopsy, but if we 
                         looked at the spinal fluid, there 
                         might be a high level of iodine, but 
                         it's difficult to know.  Whatcha 
                         thinkin', Jim?

                                     JIM
                         Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - 
                         he was afraid of dying, then he kills 
                         himself in a way that leaves no trace, 
                         but he leaves two unsigned suicide 
                         notes.

                                     CORONER
                              (shrugs, skeptical)
                         If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, 
                         Jim.

                         The fact is he's gone, chief, and 
                         so's our case.

                                     LOU
                         Not unless we go for Shaw now.

                                     BILL
                         With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe?  
                         A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A 
                         drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend.  
                         Shaw's got respect, the newspaper 
                         editors, the American Bar Association - 
                         they're not...

                                     SUSIE
                         I'm afraid I'm with Bill on this 
                         one.  We haven't got the goods yet.

                                     LOU
                         We wait, Shaw's gonna get whacked.  
                         Oswald, Ruby, Ferrie, del Valle, 
                         Banister, Bowers...  how many corpses 
                         you lawyers gotta see to figure out 
                         what's going on?

                                     JIM
                         All right, all right.  Break it up.

                                     BILL
                         Where you going, boss?

                                     JIM
                         I don't know, Bill, I just don't 
                         know.

               OUTSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT THAT SAME NIGHT

               As Jim, questioned by reporters, gets in his car and leaves, 
               Bill waves goodbye to Lou and walks toward his own car, 
               dejected.  The area is cordoned off and humming with activity.  
               Frank, an FBI man who knows Bill from previous cases, 
               approaches him out of the crowd.  He wears a hat, suit, and 
               tie.

                                     FRANK
                         Bill.

                                     BILL
                         Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're 
                         wasting your time here.  Big Jim 
                         gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.

                                     FRANK
                         It's you I want to talk to, Bill.

                                     BILL
                              (laughs)
                         Boss would fry me in hog fat if he 
                         knew...
                              (motions to car)

                                     FRANK
                              (getting in the car)
                         Your boss got a serious problem, 
                         Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's 
                         been going on at your office

                                     BILL
                              (smiles)
                         Yeah, I guess you do.

                                     FRANK
                         You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking 
                         as a friend now.  You're riding on 
                         the Titanic.  Time to jump off before 
                         you get destroyed along with Garrison.

                                     BILL
                         Frank, I don't want to hear it.

                                     FRANK
                         Senator Long set your boss up, my 
                         friend.

               This gets Bill's attention.

                                     FRANK
                         Who do you think fed him that 
                         information?  Garrison's going down.  
                         We're talking your career here, Bill, 
                         your life.  You're a young guy... we 
                         know you're working that Castro thing.

                                     BILL
                         No, I'm not...

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald 
                         didn't pull that trigger.  Castro 
                         did.  But if that comes out, there's 
                         gonna be a war, boy - millions of 
                         people are gonna die.  That's a hell 
                         of a lot more important than Jim 
                         Garrison.
                              (suddenly)
                         Goddammit, look at me when I talk to 
                         you!  You're too goddamn self-
                         opinionated, now shut up.  If you 
                         got a brain in that thick skull of 
                         yours, listen to me.  Listen real 
                         hard.

               Bill, taken aback, listens.

               WASHINGTON D.C. - PARK(1967)

               Jim walks down from the Lincoln Memorial, where he is met 
               unobtrusively by a military man in his 50's in casual 
               clothing, hat on his head, an erect posture.  They walk 
               towards the Mall, with the Capitol building looming in the 
               background.

                                     X
                         Jim Garrison?

                                     JIM
                         Yes.

                                     X
                              (shakes hands)
                         I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about 
                         the precautions.

                                     JIM
                         Well, I just hope it was worth my 
                         while, Mr...

               The man doesn't answer.  Jim, after his meeting with Miller 
               and loss of Ferrie, is testy and suspicious.

                                     X
                         I could give you a false name, but I 
                         won't.  Just call me X.

                                     JIM
                         I've already been warned by the 
                         Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is 
                         another type of threat, I don't...

                                     X
                         I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, 
                         and I assume if you've come this 
                         far, what I have to say interests 
                         you.  But I'm not going to name names, 
                         or tell you who or what I represent.  
                         Except to say - you're close, you're 
                         closer than you think...

               Something about his manner speaks of authority, knowledge, 
               and above all, old-fashioned honesty - the eyes looking at 
               you straight on.  He indicates a bench.

                                     X
                         Everything I'm going to tell you is 
                         classified top secret...
                              (significant look)
                         I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison.  Two 
                         wars.  I was one of those secret 
                         guys in the Pentagon that supplies 
                         the military hardware - the planes, 
                         bullets, rifles - for what we call 
                         "black operations" - "black ops", 
                         assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging 
                         elections, propoganda, psych warfare 
                         and so forth.  World War II - Rumania, 
                         Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take 
                         the Nazi intelligence apparatus out 
                         to help us fight the Communists.  
                         Italy '48 stealing elections, France 
                         '49 breaking strikes - we overthrew 
                         Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz 
                         in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.  
                         Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet 
                         '59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we 
                         were good, very good.  Then we got 
                         into the Cuban thing.  Not so good.  
                         Set up all the bases for the invasion 
                         supposed to take place in October 
                         '62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles 
                         to resist the invasion, Kennedy 
                         refused to invade and we were standing 
                         out there with our dicks in the wind.  
                         Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.  
                         Garrison, you understand?  I'll come 
                         to that later... I spent much of 
                         September '63 working on the Kennedy 
                         plan for getting all U.S.  personnel 
                         out of Vietnam by the end of '65.  
                         This plan was one of the strongest 
                         and most important papers issued 
                         from the Kennedy White House.  Our 
                         first 1,000 troops were ordered home 
                         for Christmas.  Tensions were high.  
                         In November '63, one week after the 
                         murder of Vietnamese President Diem 
                         in Saigon, and two weeks before the 
                         assassination of our President...

               FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices in 1963.  X strides down a 
               busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors, Major 
               General Y, a lean, cold warrior, battlefield handsome, 
               civilian clothes, and several advisors.  There's a U.S. flag 
               on the wall.  The status of Y is only clear by the sing on 
               the desk, the name blocked by a passing figure.

                                     X
                         ...a strange thing happened.  I was 
                         sent by my superior officer, call 
                         him Y, to the South Pole as the 
                         military escort for a group of 
                         international VIP's.  This trip had 
                         nothing to do with my nine years of 
                         work in Special Operations.  It was 
                         sort of a "paid vacation".

               We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating 
               a friendly atmosphere, and we see stock footage of a C-130 
               transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface 
               of the sea.

               Then, at a New Zealand airport, we see X, in a uniform, at a 
               newsstand reading of Kennedy's assassination.  The banner 
               headline of an "Extra" edition of The Christchurch Star 
               screams out "KENNEDY SHOT DEAD."

                         It wasn't until I was on my way back 
                         in New Zealand that I read of the 
                         President's murder.  That was 2 in 
                         the afternoon the next day New Zealand 
                         time, but already the papers had the 
                         entire history of an unknown 24-year-
                         old man, Oswald - a studio picture, 
                         detailed biographical data, Russian 
                         information - and were pretty sure 
                         of the fact he'd killed the President 
                         alone, although it took them four 
                         more hours to charge him with the 
                         murder in Texas.  It felt as if, 
                         well, a cover story was being put 
                         out like we would in a black op.

               Back at the Pentagon office, we see X returning and meeting 
               Y.  The atmosphere is cordial, but Y is slightly different 
               from before - more harried, more nervous.  He turns away to 
               light a cigarette, he doesn't want the usual conversation.

                                     X
                         Anyway, after I came back I asked 
                         myself why was I, the chief of special 
                         ops, selected to travel to the South 
                         Pole at that time to do a job that 
                         any number of others could have done?  
                         One of my routine duties if I had 
                         been in Washington would've been to 
                         arrange for additional security in 
                         Texas.  The Secret Service is 
                         relatively small, and by custom the 
                         military will augment them.  I checked 
                         it out when I got back and sure 
                         enough, I found out someone had told 
                         the 112th Military Intelligence Group 
                         at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam 
                         Houston to "stand down" that day, 
                         over the protests of the unit 
                         Commander, a Colonel Reich...

               We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a 
               day in 1963.  Inside, on the same day, Col. Reich is on the 
               phone, puzzled.

                         Now this is significant, because it 
                         is standard operating procedure, 
                         especially in a known hostile city 
                         like Dallas, to supplement the Secret 
                         Service.  Even if we had not allowed 
                         the bubbletop to be removed from the 
                         limousine, we'd've put at least 100 
                         to 200 agents on the sidewalks, 
                         without question!  There'd already 
                         been several attempts on de Gaulle's 
                         life in France.  Only a month before 
                         in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai 
                         Stevenson had been spit on and hit.  
                         We'd have arrived days ahead of time, 
                         studied the route, checked all the 
                         buildings...
                         We never would've allowed all those 
                         wide-open empty windows overlooking 
                         Dealey... never...  We would have 
                         had our own snipers covering the 
                         area.  The moment a window went up 
                         they'd have been on the radio.  We 
                         would've been watching the crowds - 
                         packages, rolled up newspapers, a 
                         coat over an arm, never would have 
                         let a man open an umbrella along the 
                         way - Never would've allowed that 
                         limousine to slow down to 10 miles 
                         per hour, much less take that unusual 
                         curve at Houston and Elm.  You would 
                         have felt an Army presence in the 
                         streets that day, but none of this 
                         happened.  It was a violation of the 
                         most basic protection codes we have.  
                         And it is the best indication of a 
                         massive plot in Dallas.  Who could 
                         have best done that?  People in my 
                         business, Mr. Garrison.  People like 
                         my superior officer could've told 
                         Col. Reich, "Look - we have another 
                         unit coming from so and so providing 
                         security.  You'll stand down."  That 
                         day, in fact, there were some 
                         individual Army Intelligence people 
                         in Dallas and I'm still trying to 
                         figure out who and why.  But they 
                         weren't protecting the client.  One 
                         of them, by the way, was caught in 
                         the Book Depository after police 
                         sealed it off.

               In Dealey Plaza, 1963, we see an Army intelligence man taking 
               a shot with a Minolta camera.

                         Army Intell had a "Harvey Lee Oswald" 
                         on file, but all those files have 
                         been destroyed.  Many strange things 
                         were happening that day, and Lee 
                         Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with 
                         them.  We had the entire Cabinet on 
                         a trip to the Far East.  We had a 
                         third of a combat division returning 
                         from Germany in the air above the 
                         United States at the time of the 
                         shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the 
                         entire telephone system went dead in 
                         Washington for a solid hour, and on 
                         the plane back to Washington, word 
                         was radioed from the White House 
                         Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson 
                         that one individual performed the 
                         assassination.  Does that sound like 
                         a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr. 
                         Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The 
                         cabinet was out of the country to 
                         get their perception out of the way.  
                         The troops were in the air for 
                         possible riot control.  The phones 
                         didn't work to keep the wrong stories 
                         from spreading if anything went wrong 
                         with the plan.  Nothing was left to 
                         chance.  I bet you there were even 
                         backup teams and cars on the other 
                         side of the underpass in the event 
                         that Kennedy got through wounded.  
                         They would have moved in with vehicles 
                         like they did with de Gaulle.  He 
                         could not be allowed to escape alive.

                         I never though things were the same 
                         after that.  Vietnam started for 
                         real.  There was an air of, I don't 
                         know, make-believe in the Pentagon 
                         and the CIA.  Those of us who'd been 
                         in secret ops since the beginning 
                         knew the Warren Commission was 
                         fiction, but there was something... 
                         deeper, uglier.  And I knew Allen 
                         Dulles very well.  I briefed him 
                         many a time in his house.  He was 
                         also General Y's benefactor.  But 
                         for the life of me I still can't 
                         figure out why Dulles was appointed 
                         to investigate Kennedy's death.  The 
                         man who had fired him.  I got out in 
                         '64.  I retired from the U.S. Air 
                         Force.

                         I never realized Kennedy was so 
                         dangerous to the establishment.  Is 
                         that why?

                         "Why?" - the "how" is just "scenery" 
                         for the suckers...  Oswald, Ruby,

                         like a parlor game, but it prevents 
                         them from asking the most important 
                         question - Why?  Why was Kennedy 
                         killed?  Who benefitted?  Who has 
                         the power to cover it up?... You 
                         know in '61 right after the Bay of 
                         Pigs - very few people know about 
                         this - I participated in drawing up 
                         National Security Action Memos 55, 
                         56, and 57.  These are crucial 
                         documents, classified top secret, 
                         but basically in them Kennedy 
                         instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman 
                         of the Joint Chiefs, that from here 
                         on forward...

               document is moved by hand into Lemnitzer's office where we 
               see a set of hands holding it while it's read.  There's a

                         be wholly responsible for all covert 
                         paramilitary action in peacetime.  
                         This basically ended the reign of

                         pieces", - and now was ordering the 
                         military to help.  This was 
                         unprecedented.  I can't tell you the 
                         shock waves this sent along the

                         Kennedy's directives were never really 
                         implemented, because of bureaucratic 
                         resistance, but one of the results 
                         was that the Cuban operation was 
                         turned over to my department as 
                         "Operation Mongoose", which meant 
                         that people like my superior officer, 
                         General Y, took over the Cuban 
                         personnel that were being trained to 
                         invade Cuba - and the bases like the 
                         training camp at Pontchartrain in 
                         your home state that were closed 
                         down by Kennedy... and that's how 
                         the "black ops" people, people like 
                         General Y, ended up taking the rules 
                         of covert warfare they'd used abroad 
                         and brought'em into this country.

               about what he should do now.  The size of it stuns him.  He 
               is lost, reeling back to the past in his mind.

               DISSOLVE TO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of Dachau concentration camp: 
               thousands of bodies are piled and bulldozed... And then back 
               to Jim at Arlington Cemetery reliving it... only the enormity 
               of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil.  In a 
               strange way, it reassures him.

                         ...don't underestimate the budget 
                         cuts Kennedy called for in March of 
                         '63 either - close to 52 military 
                         installations in 25 states, 21 
                         overseas bases, you're talking big 
                         money.  You know how many helicopters 
                         have been lost in Vietnam?  About 
                         three thousand so far.  Who makes 
                         them?  Bell Helicopter.  Who owns 
                         Bell?  Bell was near bankruptcy when 
                         the First National Bank of Boston 
                         approached the CIA about developing 
                         the helicopter for Indochina usage.  
                         How 'bout the f-111 fighters?  General 
                         Dynamics in Fort Worth.  Who owns 
                         that?  Find out the defense budget 
                         since the war began.  $75 going on a 
                         hundred billion ... $200 billion'll 
                         be spent before it ends.  In 1950 it 
                         was $13 billion.  No war, no money.  
                         Sometimes I think the organizing 
                         principle of any society is for war.  
                         The authority of the state over it's 
                         people resides in it's war powers.  
                         Even Eisenhower - military hero of 
                         WWII - warned us about it: "beware 
                         the military - industrial complex", 
                         he said.  Kennedy wanted to end the 
                         Cold War in his second term.  He 
                         wanted to call of the moon race in 
                         favor of cooperation with the Soviets.  
                         He signed a treaty with the Soviets 
                         to ban nuclear testing, he refused 
                         to invade Cuba in '62, and he set 
                         out to withdraw from Vietnam.  But 
                         that all ended on November 22, 1963.

               FLASHBACK TO the White House, 1963.  Lyndon Johnson is with 
               Henry Cabot Lodge.  We see them as shadowy figures from a 
               distance across the wide room, or near a veranda with a porch 
               and plenty of light.  Johnson, his back to us, talks in a 
               loud, thick Texas drawl (mostly muted) and signs a document.

                         Only four days after J.F.K. was shot, 
                         Lyndon Johnson signed National 
                         Security Memo 273, which essentially 
                         reversed Kennedy's new withdrawal 
                         policy and gave the green light to 
                         the covert operations against North 
                         Vietnam that provoked the Gulf of 
                         Tonkin incident.  In that document 
                         lay the Vietnam War.

               In the park with X, Jim is staggered by all this information.  
               X ceases walking and looks at Jim.

                         killed him because he wanted to change 
                         things.  In our time - in our country?

                         some kinda ego-crazed southern

               Jim watches this mystery man walking away.  The figure 
               vanishes in the Washington breeze.  Flags flap over some 
               distant memorial to some distant history of the Republic.

               EXTERIOR OF CLAY SHAW'S HOUSE - NEW ORLEANS(1967)

               Jim, Lou, Al, Numa and several policemen stand at the door 
               as Clay Shaw comes to it.

                                     LOU
                         Mr. Shaw, you're under arrest, charged

                         agreement with other persons for the 
                         specific purpose of committing the

               face spreads, sickly, undone, his arrogant public composure 
               gone, face now filled with terror, disbelief.

                                     LOU
                         ...we have a warrant to search the 
                         premises.

               The policemen take Shaw while the D.A. staff moves into the 
               carriage house past the butler, Frankie Jenkins.

                         In the bedroom, Numa points out to 
                         Jim the hooks screwed into the 
                         ceiling.  Al pulls out five whips, 
                         several lengths of chain, a black 
                         hood and matching black cape.  Dried 
                         blood is on one whip.

               it, without thinking, possibly preoccupied by thoughts of 
               press people pushing in.

                         Yes, Mr. Shaw was included in our 
                         investigation and there was no 
                         connection found at all between Shaw 
                         and the President's assassin.

               Jim confronts a packed room.  Bill is with him.

                                     JIM
                         If Mr. Shaw had no connection to the 
                         assassination, why did the FBI 
                         investigate him?  And why, if they 
                         did, is his name not mentioned once 
                         in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren 
                         Report, even it if is to clear his 
                         name?  I doubt this Attorney General 
                         would qualify for my staff.

               We see a shot of the Supreme Court building in Washington, 
               D.C. and then a corridor inside the building.  A Chief 
               Justice, looking gray and wise like Earl Warren, moves along 
               the corridor in his black robe delivering his verdict to the 
               press.

                                     CHIEF JUSTICE
                         No, I don't think so.  Mr. Garrison 
                         has presented absolutely nothing 
                         publicly to contradict our findings.  
                         As yet I have not heard one fact to 
                         refute the Commission determination 
                         that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

               In his own office, Jim responds to Justice Warren.

                         I congratulate Mr. Shaw.  Most 
                         witnesses have to wait for trial 
                         before they're allowed to produce 
                         sacred cows like the Chief Justice 
                         of the land as a character witness, 
                         who is of course not under oath and 
                         free from the laws of perjury.

                         even partly true in this case, you 
                         realize you are damaging the 
                         credibility of our government, 
                         possibly destroying it?

                         Let me ask you... is a government 
                         worth preserving when it lies to the 
                         people?  It has become a dangerous 
                         country, sir, when you can't trust 
                         anyone anymore, when you can't tell 
                         the truth.  I say let justice be 
                         done, though the heavens fall.

               It doesn't play with the press.  They shuffle off, quiet, 
               whispering.

               Julia Ann Mercer, 28, looks at Jim with sincere eyes.  Her 
               husband, a prosperous Republican businessman, watches from 
               the corner.  Jim - along with Al - has her testimony in front 
               of him.

                                     JIM
                         In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, 
                         it says you were at Dealey Plaza two 
                         hours before the assassination but 
                         that...

                                     MERCER
                         Yes, it was about 11 in the morning.  
                         I was driving west on Elm Street 
                         toward the Triple Underpass, in a 
                         rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll 
                         never forget that day.

               FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza in 1963.  It's a normal scene - 
               cars, traffic, people starting to arrive for Kennedy's 
               appearance.  We catch a glimpse of Julia Ann Mercer, 23, 
               driving, then stopping traffic.

                                     MERCER
                         ...there was quite a bit of traffic 
                         and I was stopped alongside a green 
                         pickup truck.  It was very noticeable 
                         because it was blocking traffic and 
                         it was parked with two wheels on the 
                         curb.  When I saw the gun, I thought - 
                         the Secret Service is not very secret.

               She glances over at the man in the driver's seat.  It's Jack 
               Ruby, wearing a green jacket.  Then she sees a young white 
               man in his mid - 20's, in a gray jacket, brown pants, plaid 
               shirt and wool stocking hat, getting out of the passenger 
               side, going to the rear of the van, opening a tool compartment 
               and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in 
               paper.  He walks up the embankment in the direction of the 
               picket fence.  Ruby looks over and stares at Julia Ann, who 
               turns away and notices three police officers standing near a 
               motorcycle on the overpass bridge.  Her eyes lock with Ruby's 
               a second time and as the traffic moves, she drives on.

                                     MERCER
                         The next morning, Saturday, I went 
                         to the FBI office and the agents 
                         showed me photographs...

               In the Dallas FBI office, Mercer sits at a table looking at 
               photos.  Two FBI agents stand near her showing her photos.  
               She shakes her head "no" several times, until they put a 
               shot of Jack Ruby in front of her.  She holds it up.

                                     MERCER
                         I picked out three pictures that 
                         looked generally like the driver of 
                         the truck and then...

                                     MERCER
                         That's the man.

                                     FBI AGENT
                              (to Second Agent)
                         Jack Ruby.

                                     SECOND AGENT
                         What about these others?  You said 
                         they might be him.

                                     MERCER
                         They look a little like him.  But 
                         no,
                              (holding up the Ruby 
                              photo)
                         I'm sure this is the man.

               Back in the present, Jim continues to question Mercer.

                                     JIM
                         You mean you identified him on 
                         Saturday, the day before Ruby shot 
                         Oswald?

                                     MERCER
                         That's right.  When I saw him on TV, 
                         I was shocked.  I said to my family, 
                         "that was the man I saw in the truck."

                                     JIM
                              (skeptical)
                         But you didn't seem nearly so sure 
                         in your statement to the Warren 
                         Commission.

                                     MERCER
                         That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.  
                         You see, they've been altered.  My 
                         statements...

               Jim is silent.  Mercer picks up the report and finds the 
               pertinent paragraphs:

                                     MERCER
                         This says "Mercer could not identify 
                         any of the photographs as being 
                         identical with the person she had 
                         observed slouched over the wheel of 
                         a green Ford pickup truck."  That's 
                         not true.  I recognized him and I 
                         told them so... They also said it 
                         was a dark green air conditioning 
                         truck, which it was not.  And here...
                              (she goes to another 
                              report)
                         ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report.  
                         This is really strange.  See that 
                         notarized signature on the bottom of 
                         each page?  That's not my signature.  
                         And there never was any notary present 
                         during any of my questioning.
                              (she hands the papers 
                              back to Jim)
                         I guess that's all...

                                     JIM
                         Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, 
                         it's difficult to accept this.

                                     MERCER
                         I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is 
                         just not doing their job.

                                     HUSBAND
                         I'm a Republican, Mr. Garrison, and 
                         I don't go in for this kind of 
                         government bashing, but I must tell 
                         you something's not right when they 
                         don't even bother to call Julia in 
                         front of the Warren Commission.

                                     JIM
                         They didn't call a lot of people, 
                         Mr. Mercer.  I think it's safe to 
                         say the Warren Report is a work of 
                         fiction.

               DALLAS CLUB - NIGHT(1967)

               BEVERLY, a woman of ample proportions and a big, cute Texas 
               face, ex-club singer, meets with Jim and Lou Ivon in a 
               nightclub not unlike Ruby's Carousel.

                                     LOU
                         Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison about the 
                         Carousel club.

                                     BEVERLY (V.O.)
                         Oh yes, I used to go over there a 
                         lot to see Jack and especially my 
                         friend Jada who danced there.  It 
                         was the real swinging spot in town.  
                         Everybody came.  Businessmen, 
                         politicians from Austin, Lyndon 
                         Johnson's friends... Dallas was a 
                         slow town back then.  You chewed 
                         toothpicks, played dominos, spit and 
                         dated policemen.  But Jack's was 
                         exciting.  There were always cops 
                         there.  Jack liked 'em around, but 
                         he used to throw the drunks out 
                         himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent-
                         tempered man... it seemed everybody 
                         in those days knew Jack was with the 
                         Mob.  The cops were "bad" back then - 
                         they'd shake you down for the money 
                         in your pocket.  They put a lotta 
                         people in the cemetery, especially 
                         colored people.

                                     LOU
                         Beverly, what about Lee?

               Jada and Beverly sit down at the table with Ferrie, Oswald, 
               and Jack, with Jack doing the buying.  It's too loud to hear 
               anything.

                                     BEVERLY (V.O.)
                         Oh, yeah.  One time I came in, Jack 
                         introduces me to these two guys.  He 
                         said, "Beverly, this is my friend 
                         Lee..." and I didn't catch the other 
                         guy's name.  He was a weird-looking 
                         guy with those funny little eyebrows.  
                         The other guy, Lee, didn't make much 
                         of an impression either.  He wasn't 
                         good-looking or nuthin', he didn't 
                         look like he had any money, and he 
                         was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay 
                         him much mind.  Well, I might not 
                         remember a name, but I always remember 
                         a face.  When I saw him tow weeks 
                         later on the television, I screamed, 
                         "Oh, my God - that's him!  That's 
                         Jack's friend!"  I knew right then 
                         it had something to do with the 
                         Mafia... Well, about a week later, 
                         after she told the newspapers she'd 
                         met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada 
                         disappears off the face of the 
                         Earth...

               THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON JADA

                                     BEVERLY (V.O.)
                         Never knew what happened to her till 
                         Herman offered to sell me her 
                         wardrobe.  I said, "but Jada's coming 
                         back," and I remember the way he 
                         smiled... and I knew she was never 
                         coming back.

               BACK TO the 1967 scene.

                                     JIM
                         Will you testify,  Beverly?

                                     BEVERLY
                         I don't think so, sir.

                                     LOU
                         I thought when we came here, we had 
                         an agreement.

                                     BEVERLY
                         I just don't want to become another 
                         statistic like her.  If they can 
                         kill the President, do you think 
                         they're gonna think twice about a 
                         two-bit showgirl like me?

                                     LOU
                         We could call you in, Beverly.

                                     JIM
                         I know the pressure you're under, 
                         Beverly.  Don't think I don't.
                              (as he exits)
                         I understand.

               DISSOLVE TO DEALEY PLAZA(1967)

               Our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme 
               south side of the Plaza.  J.C. Price, the building engineer, 
               in hat and overalls, points for Jim and Lou.

                                     PRICE (V.O.)
                         ...yes, sir, right here on this spot.  
                         The shots came from near that wooden 
                         fence over there, near the overpass.

               The camera tightens on the picket fence.

                                     PRICE
                         I saw a man run from this spot and 
                         go behind the Book Depository - 30 
                         minutes later I gave this information 
                         to the Sheriff.

               On the overpass near Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, a tan, 
               elderly, leather-faced signal supervisor, points to the picket 
               fence for Jim and Lou.  His accent is thick and rural.  We 
               saw him before, briefly, when Jim was reading the Warren 
               Report.

                                     HOLLAND
                         I made it very clear to the Warren 
                         people one of the shots came from 
                         behind that picket fence.  I heard 
                         the report and saw the smoke come 
                         out about 6 or 8 feet above the 
                         ground, right out from under those 
                         trees.  There is no doubt whatsoever 
                         in my mind...

               FLASHBACK TO the restaged shooting.  The smoke hangs under 
               the trees.

               CUT TO Richard Dodd on the overpass.  He's a cowboy type 
               with a hat and an even thicker accent than Holland.

                                     DODD
                              (pointing)
                         ...we, all four of us, all railroad 
                         men, standing here, seen about the 
                         same thing.  The smoke came from 
                         behind the hedge - and a motorcycle 
                         policeman dropped his cycle in the 
                         street and run up the embankment...

               FLASHBACK to the motorcycle...

               BACK TO 1967.  Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near 
               the picket fence.  We feel the emptiness of the area now and 
               see the normal amount of traffic driving by.

                                     HOLLAND
                         ...we came around here to look for 
                         tracks.  It rained that morning and 
                         we found a bunch of cigarette butts.  
                         Someone'd been standing about here...

               The camera shows the "spot" and Lou sighting.

                                     LOU
                         This is a good spot, chief, for the 
                         head shot.

               Jim looks, reliving the moment.

               Later Jim and Lou stand on the south side of Elm Street in 
               Dealey Plaza talking to Jean Hill, an attractive, 30-ish 
               teacher.  Her demeanor has a rock-solid Texas back-country 
               conviction to it; she's a woman not easily frightened.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I was standing here next to my friend 
                         Mary Mooman, who took the photograph 
                         when he was killed...

               We see a flash of the Moorman photograph - a blurry Polaroid 
               with the President in the foreground and the picket fence in 
               background.  We will return to this photograph in more detail 
               later.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I jumped out in the street and yelled, 
                         "Hey Mr. President, look over here, 
                         we wanna take your picture."  He 
                         looked up and then shots rang out.  
                         Mary fell to the ground right away, 
                         shouting, "Get down, they're shooting, 
                         get down, they're shooting." I knew 
                         it but I was moving to get closer to 
                         him.  The driver had stopped - I 
                         don't know what was wrong with that 
                         driver.  And then, out of the corner 
                         of my eye, I saw this flash of light, 
                         in the bushes and that last shot... 
                         just ripped his head off, I mean, 
                         blood, brains, just blew everything...

               FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting.  We hear the sound of 
               shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jean's point of view.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I looked up and saw smoke from the 
                         Knoll.  And everything was frozen - 
                         seemed like people wasn't even 
                         breathing, like you're looking at a 
                         picture - except this one guy.  I 
                         saw this one guy running from the 
                         Book Depository towards the railroad 
                         tracks.  And that was the same man I 
                         saw on TV two days later shooting 
                         Oswald.  That was Jack Ruby.  No 
                         question about it.

               Blurry image - we're not at all sure what or who or if... 
               but a seed is planted.  We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers 
               saw... then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book 
               Depository toward the railroad tracks.  Then we see Jean's 
               view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others.  there 
               are yells, shouts, and general confusion.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         It was him I was chasing up the Grassy 
                         Knoll, thinking our guys had shot 
                         back and maybe we got one of them.  
                         I don't know what I would have done 
                         if I had caught him, but I knew 
                         something terrible had happened and 
                         somebody had to do something.

               At the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, 
               railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, 
               confusion...

                                     *JEAN HILL
                         I never did catch him.  All I saw in 
                         that parking area were railroad 
                         workers and Dallas' finest.

               Two Secret Service types approach her suddenly, and one of 
               them puts an arm on her shoulder.

                                     FIRST AGENT
                         Secret Service, ma'am.  You're coming 
                         with us.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Oh no, I'm not.  I don't know you.  
                         We gotta catch this shooter - don't 
                         you realize?

                                     SECOND AGENT
                              (grabbing her other 
                              shoulder)
                         I said you're coming with us.  I 
                         want the pictures in your pocket.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         ...he put a hurt on me but good.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I don't have any pictures!  I have 
                         to go back and find my friend Mary.  
                         Lemme alone!

               The two agents hustle her away.

                                     FIRST AGENT
                         Hush!  Just smile and keep walking.

               Hill, 32 years old that day, is shown into a third floor 
               office of the County Courts Building - which has a view of 
               the assassination area.  Other Secret Service agents are 
               there.  Some 18 people are detained there.

               TIME CUT TO two men interrogating Hill.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         These new people never identified 
                         themselves.  They musta been watching 
                         the whole thing 'cause they knew 
                         everything Mary and me had been doing 
                         that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard 
                         to find - wearing that red raincoat.

                                     MAN
                         How many shots you say you heard?

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Four to six.

                                     MAN
                         That's impossible.  You heard echoes 
                         ...echoes.  We have three bullets 
                         and three shots which came from the 
                         Book Depository and that's all we're 
                         willing to say.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         ...which is strange 'cause this is 
                         less than 20 minutes after the 
                         assassination.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         No, I saw a guy shooting from over 
                         there.  He was behind that fence.  
                         What are you going to do about it?

                                     MAN
                         We have that taken care of.  You 
                         only heard three shots and you are 
                         not to talk to anyone about this.  
                         No one, you hear?

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, 
                         but it sure felt like two and two 
                         was coming up three... and then they 
                         took Mary's five snapshots from me, 
                         sent them to Washington, and when 
                         they returned them weeks later, two 
                         of them had the backgrounds 
                         mutilated... The only one we saved 
                         was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want 
                         to go to Washington when the Warren 
                         Commission subpoenaed me... so the 
                         lawyer come down here and interviewed 
                         me at Parkland Hospital.

               In a Parkland Hospital office in 1964, a lawyer interviews 
               Jean Hill.  A female stenographer takes notes.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         He asked me why I thought I was in 
                         danger and I said:

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Well if they can kill the President, 
                         they can certainly get me.

                                     LAWYER
                         That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill.  
                         We have the man that killed the 
                         President.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         No, you don't!

                                     JEAN HILL
                         He kept trying to get me to change 
                         my story about the shots.  He was 
                         getting hot under the collar, and 
                         telling the woman not to write when 
                         he wanted.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Look, do you want the truth, or just 
                         what you want me to say?

                                     LAWYER
                         I want the truth.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         The truth is that I heard between 
                         four and six shots.  I'm not going 
                         to lie for you.

                                     LAWYER
                         ...you heard echoes.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         No.  I had guns all my life.  I used 
                         to go turtle shooting.

                                     LAWYER
                         I realize you're under a great deal 
                         of stress .. it's clouded your 
                         judgement.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         So off the record, he starts talking 
                         about my family, and even mentioned 
                         my marriage was in trouble like I 
                         didn't know it or something.  He got 
                         angrier and angrier and then:

                                     LAWYER
                         Look, we can put you in a mental 
                         institution.  We can make you look 
                         crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and 
                         everybody knows how crazy she is.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         I knew something was crooked as a 
                         dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is 
                         just taking a deposition gets that 
                         involved and angry... sure enough, 
                         when I finally read my testimony as 
                         published by the Warren Commission, 
                         it was a fabrication from start to 
                         finish.

                                     JIM
                         Are you willing to testify, Mrs. 
                         Hill?

               Back at the Knoll.

                                     JEAN HILL
                              (without hesitation)
                         Damned right I would.  Somebody's 
                         got to tell the truth around here 
                         'cause the Government sure ain't 
                         doing it.

               DISSOLVE TO a scene inside the Texas School Book Depository 
               in 1967.  Jim and Lou walk the floor and look out the windows.  
               Lou has a Mannlicher-Carcano in his hand with a sight and 
               clip.  We see Oswald's supposed view of the limousine as he 
               pulls the trigger.  Now, innocuous traffic goes by, but the 
               iris of the camera tightens into a sniper's scope.

                                     LOU
                         The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots 
                         in 5.6 seconds.  Here.  I'm Oswald.  
                         Time me.

               Lou cocks the Mannlicher for the first shot.  Jim looks at 
               this watch.

               Lou assumes the Oswald pose, crouched at the window aiming 
               out.

                                     JIM
                         Go!

               Lou pulls, quickly recharges the bolt, fires, recycles, fires.

                                     LOU
                         Time?

                                     JIM
                         Between six and seven seconds.

                         The key is the second and third shots 
                         came right on top of each other, and 
                         it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to 
                         recycle this thing.
                              (he recycles the bolt 
                              for firing)
                         The other problem is there was a 
                         tree right there...
                              (he points)
                         Blocking the first two shots at the 
                         time they occur in the Zapruder film.

                         Didn't Hoover say something about 
                         that?  The leaves had fallen off in 
                         November?

                         It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.
                              (he shakes his head)
                         It sheds it's leaves the first week 
                         of March.  You try to hit a moving 
                         target at 88 yards through heavy 
                         foliage with this cheap 13-dollar 
                         sucker, the world's worst shoulder 
                         weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two 
                         sets of tests and not one of their 
                         sharpshooters could match Oswald's 
                         performance.  Not one.  And Oswald 
                         was at best a medium shot.  The scope 
                         was defective on it, too.  I mean 
                         this is the whole essence of the 
                         case to me.  The guy couldn't do the 
                         shooting.  Nobody could.  And they 
                         sold this lemon to the American 
                         public.

                                     JIM
                         The Zapruder film is the proof they 
                         didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get 
                         our hands on it.

                                     LOU
                         That means we gotta subpoena Time-
                         Life on it.

                                     JIM
                              (looks out the window)
                         Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up 
                         Houston?  There's plenty of time - 
                         he's out in the open - a frontal 
                         shot?

               Jim points the Carcano south, right up Houston Street, 
               following a car that happens to be passing by - a convertible 
               with an unknown woman driving.

                                     LOU
                         I asked myself the same thing.  Common 
                         sense.  Even if you miss the first 
                         shot, if he accelerates you still 
                         got him for a second shot.  No... 
                         the only reason for waiting to get 
                         him on Elm is you got him in a 
                         triangulated crossfire.  You got him 
                         on a flat low trajectory from the 
                         front at the fence there.

               The camera swings to the Grassy Knoll and the picket fence 
               as seen from the sixth floor of the Depository.

                                     LOU
                         ...you put a third team there - in 
                         that building, on a low floor.

               The camera swings to the Daltex Building across the street.

                                     LOU
                         When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, 
                         it's a turkey shoot.

                                     JIM
                              (aiming)
                         How many men?

                                     LOU
                         One shooter.  One spotter on a radio.  
                         Maybe three teams.  I'd say these 
                         were professional riflemen, chief, 
                         serious people.  Hunters...  patient.  
                         It takes skill to kill with a rifle, 
                         that's why there's been no execution 
                         of an executive with one in 200 
                         years... "3-2-1...  green!"
                              (he taps Jim on the 
                              shoulder)
                         Or else "Abort!  Abort!"

               Jim pulls the dead trigger, reliving the moment through the 
               scope on a passing car.

                                     LOU
                         Main Street's over there - the 
                         original parade route on the way to 
                         the Trade Mart.  Too far right?  
                         Impossible shot.

               Jim swings the scope up to confront Main Street.  Another 
               car is in his sight.  Too far.

                                     LOU
                         So they changed the route to bring 
                         it this way.

               Moving at a normal 25 mph, they knew the motorcade would 
               have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn.  
               That's where you get him.

               The camera swings to the Houston and Main intersection.

                         route?

                         dry run with Chief Curry a few days 
                         before.  But they didn't bother 
                         running through Dealey.  They stopped 
                         right there, said something like, 
                         "and afterwards there's only the 
                         freeway," and went home.

                         Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy 
                         in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs 
                         fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, 
                         called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he 
                         came to New Orleans to address the 
                         Foreign Policy Association, you know

                         Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy 
                         fired them both.  Cabell was his 
                         deputy for nine years.

               Lou walks to another window in the empty Book Depository 
               where Oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out 
               over the plaza, with all its ghosts.  Jim and Lou are two 
               men - with only two men's power.  A terrible aloneness 
               pervades their minds.

                                     JIM
                         Maybe we should just call it a day, 
                         Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a 
                         little behind.  We got two people 
                         killed, maybe more we never thought 
                         about.

                                     LOU
                         You never got anyone killed, boss.  
                         Their actions killed them years 
                         before.  If we stopped now, it'd be 
                         even more wrong.

               FLASHBACK TO 1963 - the sixth floor of the Texas School Book 
               Depository - the same place Jim and Lou are now.  Jim looks 
               around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox 
               radio, in repairman clothes.  Jim is watching.  Neither of 
               these men is Oswald.  We hear the sounds of the motorcade 
               below.  The shooter pulls the trigger on the Carcano.  A 
               loud frightening sound snaps Jim back to the present.

               GARRISON'S OFFICE - 9 MONTHS LATER - 1968

               We see another smoke-filled conference of assistants.  
               Paperwork is stacked in the corners almost to the ceiling; 
               there are coffee cups and doughnuts on desks.  The 
               disorganization and lack of resources are apparent.  The 
               staff working on this project now numbers some eleven people, 
               and there are some new investigators and assistants.  We 
               sense that the trial is drawing closer.

                         Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The 
                         bad news is the IRS has just requested 
                         an audit on your income from this 
                         office.

                         I expected that two months ago, and 
                         they're wasting their time... The 
                         bad news is the National Guard has 
                         just asked me to resign after 18 
                         years.
                              (we see his hurt)
                         Well, maybe that's good news - it 
                         was never as good as combat, but 
                         this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald 
                         and Shaw?

                         Yeah.  They were seen together in 
                         Clinton in early September.  The 
                         Civil Rights Movement was running a 
                         voter registration drive.

                                     BILL
                         ...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was 
                         working on some arms deal to discredit 
                         the civil rights movement.  No one 
                         really knows what they were doing 
                         there, but everyone sure saw 'em.  
                         They stood out like cottonballs.  I 
                         got whites and blacks saw 'em, but 
                         last time I checked there was nothing 
                         illegal with registering to vote.  
                         We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon 
                         Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall 
                         near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's 
                         tough, boss - no one wants to talk 
                         about Shaw.  He's...

                         I think Clinton is a breakthrough.  
                         Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald.  
                         Is that right?  It proves he's a 
                         liar.  Keep on it, Bill.

                         This is interesting - are you ready 
                         for this?  Oswald went to see the 
                         FBI two weeks before the 
                         assassination.  It seems Special 
                         Agent Hosty made three routine visits 
                         to his house, supposedly to keep an 
                         eye on Marina Oswald.

               FLASHBACK TO Dallas FBI Office in 1963.  Oswald is at the 
               counter addressing the female receptionist.

                                     OSWALD
                         I want to see Special Agent Hosty.

                         I'm sorry, he's not in.  Can someone 
                         else help you?

                                     OSWALD
                         Can I use a pen?

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         He left a note.  Hosty told a Dallas 
                         newspaperman it was a warning to him 
                         to stop questioning Marina at their 
                         home when Oswald was not present.  
                         She was not a citizen, so possibly 
                         he was threatening to deport her 
                         back to Russia.

               TIMECUT TO FBI James Hosty confronting his agitated superior, 
               FBI Agent Shanklin in one of his cubicles.

                         But what the note really said no one 
                         knows because his boss Shanklin told 
                         Hosty...

                                     SHANKLIN
                              (reading the note)
                         Oswald's dead now.  There's no trial.  
                         Get rid of it.  I don't even want 
                         this in the office.  Get rid of it, 
                         Hosty.
                              (he gives it back to 
                              Hosty)

                         Hosty tore it up and flushed it down 
                         the toilet.  Waggoner Carr, the 
                         Attorney  General of Texas, says he 
                         had evidence from the Dallas Sheriff's 
                         office that Oswald had been employed 
                         as an undercover informant for the 
                         FBI at a salary of $200 a month, 
                         beginning more than a year before 
                         the murder.

                              (in present)
                         This is just speculation, people, 
                         but what if the note was describing 
                         the assassination attempt on J.F.K.?
                              (the staff seem 
                              surprised by the 
                              thought)
                         Come on guys, think - that's the 
                         only reason to destroy it, because 
                         if it was any kind of threat, like 
                         Hosty said, they would've kept it 
                         'cause it makes their case against 
                         the "angry lone nut" stronger!  
                         Remember the New Orleans meeting 
                         with Agent Quigley the day he got 
                         busted?

               FLASHBACK TO Oswald, under arrest, meeting with Quigley.

                                     JIM
                         ...there again Quigley destroyed the 
                         notes of the meeting.  I think we 
                         can raise the possibility that Oswald 
                         not only was an informant but that 
                         he may well have been the original 
                         source for the telex we have dated 
                         November 17 warning of the Kennedy 
                         assassination in Dallas on November 
                         22.

                         a copy of this.  It went all over 
                         the country.  Nothing was done, and 
                         the motorcade went ahead on schedule - 
                         and this wasn't even mentioned in 
                         the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.

                         etc..."

               FLASHBACK TO New Orleans FBI office in 1963.  Walter, the 
               night clerk, receives the teletype, reads it, and runs it.

                         ...shortly after the assassination, 
                         Walter says, the telex was removed 
                         from all the files in all cities, as 
                         an obvious embarrassment to the 
                         Bureau.  I believe Oswald was sending 
                         information through Hosty...

               FLASHBACK TO a Dallas safe house in 1963.  Oswald, Ruby, and 
               several Cubans including the Bull and the Indian are talking.

                                     JIM
                         I have a hunch that from the get go, 
                         Oswald had infiltrated this group, 
                         probably Cubans or right-wing 
                         extremists.  He was at the Book 
                         Depository that day, told to be there 
                         by their handlers, either to prevent 
                         the assassination or to take part in 
                         it.  They coulda told him anything, 
                         either 1) they were going to close 
                         down the plotters that day, or 2) 
                         they were going to fake an attack on 
                         Kennedy to whip up public opinion 
                         against Russia or Cuba and reverse 
                         his policies - it doesn't really 
                         matter what they told him, 'cause he 
                         was under orders, he was a foot 
                         soldier.

               Underneath the voice-over we hear and see Oswald, with a 
               floor plan of the Book Depository, at the center of the group.  
               Jack Ruby, Bull, and the Indian, two or three young Cubans 
               and a young white shooter - the man in the plaid shirt 
               described by Julia Ann Mercer - are also there.

                         turn from Main onto Houston, that'll 
                         do the trick, 'cause it'll slow down 
                         to make the turn here.  You can't

                         He's a dead duck.

               Ruby shares a look with Bull unbeknownst to Oswald, and then 
               we see the looks on the faces of Jim's team.

                         the whole FBI here.  A telex that 
                         disappears from every single FBI

                         Army Intelligence and who knows what 
                         else, when you know you can't even 
                         keep a secret in this room between 
                         12 people!  We got leaks everywhere!
                         We're going to trial here!  What the 
                         hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, 
                         Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - 
                         maybe he's an agent, I don't know, 
                         but as a covert operator in my book 
                         he's wide open for blackmail 'cause 
                         of his homosexuality.

                         Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't 
                         know exactly what he is, where he 
                         fits, and I don't care.  I do know 
                         he's lying through his teeth and I'm 
                         not gonna let go of him!

                                     BILL
                         So for those reasons, you're going 
                         to trial against Clay Shaw, chief?  
                         Well, you're gonna lose!  We should 
                         be investigating all our Mafia leads 
                         here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, 
                         Santos Trafficante - I can buy that 
                         a hell of a lot easier than the 
                         Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows 
                         Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - 
                         Trafficante - Marcello, they hire 
                         some guns and they do Kennedy and 
                         maybe the Government doesn't want to 
                         open up a whole can o'worms there 
                         because it used the Mob to get to 
                         Castro.  Y'know, Castro being 
                         assassinated sounds pretty wild to 
                         John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the 
                         book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to 
                         me.

                                     JIM
                         I don't doubt their involvement, 
                         Bill, but at a low level.  Could the 
                         Mob change the parade route, Bill, 
                         or eliminate the protection for the 
                         President?  Could the Mob send Oswald 
                         to Russia and get him back?  Could 
                         the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and 
                         the Dallas Police to make a mess of 
                         the investigation?  Could the Mob 
                         appoint the Warren Commission to 
                         cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck 
                         the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence 
                         the national media to go to sleep?  
                         And since when has the Mob used 
                         anything but .38's for hits, up close?  
                         The Mob wouldn't have the guts or 
                         the power for something of this 
                         magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, 
                         orders, times, schedules.  This was 
                         a military-style ambush from start 
                         to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon 
                         Johnson waiting in the wings.

                                     BILL
                         Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson 
                         was involved?  The President of the 
                         United States?

               His voice is challenging.  There's a pause.  The men exchange 
               looks and wait.

                                     JIM
                         I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson 
                         got $1 billion for his Texas friends, 
                         Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh 
                         Bay for the military in Vietnam.  
                         That's just for openers.

                                     BILL
                         Boss, are you calling the President 
                         a murderer?

                                     JIM
                         If I'm so far from the truth, why is 
                         the FBI bugging our offices?  Why 
                         are our witnesses being bought off 
                         and murdered?  Why are Federal 
                         agencies blocking our extraditions 
                         and subpoenas when we were never 
                         blocked before?

                                     BILL
                         Maybe 'cause there's some rogue 
                         element in the Government!

               The others in the room groan at the reasoning.  Bill feels 
               embittered, cornered.

                                     JIM
                         With a full-blown conspiracy to cover 
                         it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, 
                         Bill?

                         everything.

                         to prove that mob boys like Barding 
                         and Jack Ruby played ball in right

               GARRISON'S LIVING ROOM - (1968)

               It's after dinner and toys scattered around the living room.  
               Snapper is chasing his sister Elizabeth around.  Virginia, 
               6, runs to the ringing phone in the living room, as her mother 
               and Mattie, stunned, watch the news of Martin Luther King's 
               death on TV.

                                     MATTIE

               CUT TO Jim's study, where Jim also watches the news in horror.  
               We see TV images of Martin Luther King on the motel balcony, 
               dead.

                         To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luther 
                         King, who preached non-violence and 
                         won the Nobel Peace Prize, was cut 
                         down earlier today by a sniper's 
                         bullets while standing on the porch 
                         of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, 
                         Tennessee.  He was surrounded by his 
                         closest aides.  The police say they 
                         have no suspects at this time.  Mr. 
                         King...

               Jim, visibly shaken, slams his book down on the desk in 
               frustration.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Uh huh.

               Liz comes to the phone, a wary look on her face.

                                     LIZ
                              (taking the phone)
                         Who are you talking to?

                                     MALE VOICE
                         Okay, Virginia, that's all I need to 
                         know.  I'll call you again when it's 
                         time for the beauty contest.

                                     LIZ
                         Who's this?... Hello?... Hello?

               After a pause, the man hangs up.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (excited)
                         Mama, I'm going to be in a beauty 
                         contest!

                                     LIZ
                         What did he ask you?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Well, he asked me everything.  He 
                         asked me...

               Liz freaks out.  She marches into Jim's study.

                                     LIZ
                         Did you enter Virginia into a beauty 
                         contest?

                                     JIM
                              (absorbed in the TV)
                         What?

                                     LIZ
                              (hysterical)
                         A man just called.  He asked her 
                         everything!

               Her height, her weight, when she came home from school.

                                     JIM
                              (distracted)
                         Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther 
                         King was killed in Memphis today!

                                     LIZ
                              (screaming)
                         Your daughter's life was just 
                         threatened!

                                     JIM
                         Just a crank making phone calls.  
                         Happens a dozen times a day at the 
                         office.

                                     LIZ
                         Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a 
                         murderer, who knows!

                                     JIM
                         Only cowards make crank calls, 
                         sweetheart, nothing is going to 
                         happen.

                                     LIZ
                         How do you know?  How do you even 
                         know what goes on in this house 
                         anymore!  You're too busy making 
                         speeches, stirring up every crazed 
                         Klansman in Louisiana after us!

                                     JIM
                         Get a hold of yourself.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids 
                         and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it 
                         anymore.

               The kids, hearing the shouting, come to watch from the door 
               of the study.

                                     JIM
                         Honey, come on.  The government wants 
                         you to be scared.  They want everybody 
                         to be scared to speak out.  They 
                         count on it.  But there's nothing to 
                         be scared of.

                                     LIZ
                         You and your government!  What's the 
                         matter with you?  Don't you have any 
                         feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind 
                         of man are you?

               Jim controls himself, shoos the kids out, closes the door.

                                     JIM
                         I'll take them up to my mother's if 
                         it'll make you feel better.  Spend a 
                         week.  I'll change the locks, the 
                         phone lines, I'll even get a 
                         bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, 
                         get a hold of yourself.

                                     LIZ
                         Jim, before this Kennedy thing, 
                         nothing mattered to you in this life 
                         more than your children.  The other 
                         night Jasper tried to show you a 
                         drawing.  You didn't even notice he 
                         was there.  He came to me bawling 
                         his little eyes out.  Jim, he's 
                         sensitive - he needs more from you.

                                     JIM
                         I promise I'll make more time for 
                         Jasper.

                                     LIZ
                         Is it such a chore?  I don't 
                         understand you.

                                     JIM
                         Damn it, if I say I'll spend more 
                         time with him, I'll spend more time 
                         with him.  I can't fight you and the 
                         world too, Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just 
                         trying to reach you.  You've changed.

                                     JIM
                         Of course, I've changed!  My eyes 
                         have opened, and once they're open, 
                         believe me, what used to look normal 
                         seems insane!  And now King.  Don't 
                         you think this has something to do 
                         with that?  Can't you see?

                                     LIZ
                              (she explodes)
                         I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm 
                         tired.  I've had enough!  They say 
                         you don't have anything anyway!  
                         Everybody in town's talking.  You're 
                         ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're 
                         attacking him because he's homosexual!  
                         Going ahead with this stupid "trial"!  
                         Did you ever once stop and consider 
                         what he's going through?

                                     JIM
                              (astounded)
                         That's not why I'm attacking him!  
                         You don't believe me - all this time 
                         you never believed me.

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe 
                         there was a conspiracy, but not the 
                         government.  I just want to raise 
                         our children and live a normal life!  
                         I want my life back!

               The children press in at the door.  Mattie, ignoring them, 
               is enraged as she watches King's eulogy on TV.  Riots are 
               already breaking out.

                                     JIM
                         Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I!  
                         I had a life too, y'know - I had a 
                         life, too.  But you just can't bury 
                         your head in the sand like some 
                         ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's 
                         not just about you - and your well-
                         being and your two cars and your 
                         kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes 
                         fine honey."  While our kids grow up 
                         into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm 
                         not "fine" about that, I'm angry.  
                         My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours 
                         is, too!  And if you don't want to 
                         support me I can understand that but 
                         don't you go start making threats of 
                         taking the children away.

                                     LIZ
                         You never talked to me this way 
                         before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making 
                         any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm 
                         taking the kids to my mother's.  I 
                         am - I am.

               She runs out, past the stunned kids, sobbing as she goes up 
               the stairs.  Jim pursues her like an angry spirit, yelling 
               up the stairs at her.

                                     JIM
                         Go on then, get out!  Go hide 
                         someplace.  Join the rest of them!  
                         They'll tell you I'm crazy.  You got 
                         plenty of people'll tell you Jim 
                         Garrison's crazy.  You won't have a 
                         problem filing your divorce papers 
                         on me ...somebody's got to try, 
                         goddammit, somebody!

               The kids move away, fearful.  Quaking with rage and hurt, 
               Jim stands there at the bottom of the stairs, strangled with 
               pain.  He takes a law dictionary in his hand and throws it 
               across the room.  Jasper and Virginia come over to him.

                                     JASPER
                         Are we going away, Daddy?

                                     JIM
                         Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

                                     JASPER
                         Because of Kennedy?
                              (a beat.  Jim doesn't 
                              answer)
                         Are the same people gonna kill us, 
                         Daddy?

                                     JIM
                         No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Do you love us?

                                     JIM
                         Yes, of course I do, honey.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         No.  I mean like mommy loves us.  
                         She really loves us.

                                     JASPER
                         I'm scared.

                                     JIM
                              (bending down)
                         There's nothing wrong with feeling a 
                         little scared, Jasper, Virginia.  
                         Telling the truth can be a scary 
                         thing.  It scared President Kennedy, 
                         but he was a brave man.  If you let 
                         yourself be too scared, then you let 
                         the bad guys take over the country, 
                         don't you - and then everybody gets 
                         scared.

                                     JASPER/VIRGINIA
                         Stay with Mom, Daddy... please.

               JERRY JOHNSON SHOW - (1968)

               The band strikes up "When the Saints Go Marching In" 
               introducing Jim, who strides in from the wings to shake hands 
               with Jerry Johnson, the friendly-looking host.

                                     SIDEKICK
                         And now, Jerry, here's Big Jim 
                         Garrison, District Attorney of New 
                         Orleans, Louisiana.

               The audience is enthusiastic.  Jim smiles and waves, then 
               sits down next to Johnson.

                                     JOHNSON
                         Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.  
                         May I call you Jim?

                                     JIM
                         I've been called everything under 
                         the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever 
                         you like.

               He reads from a script on the desk.

                                     JOHNSON
                         First we had your charge that the 
                         Cuban exiles killed the President, 
                         then the Mob, then you said the oil 
                         billionaires did it, then you said 
                         the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan 
                         collaborated to do it, now your latest 
                         theory seems to be that the CIA and 
                         the FBI and the Pentagon and the 
                         White House all combined in some 
                         elaborate conspiracy to kill John 
                         Kennedy.  Let me ask you, is there 
                         anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who 
                         you think did not conspire to kill 
                         the President?

               He fixes his eyes on Jim, waiting for a reply.  A weariness 
               has set in on Jim.  Once more into the slaughter.

                                     JIM
                         How many hours do I have to answer 
                         that one?  Well let's just say this, 
                         Jerry - I've stopped beating my wife.
                              (the audience laughs)
                         Or maybe you should ask Lyndon 
                         Johnson.  We know he has some answers.

               The audience, loving it, cheers.  Johnson looks at Jim 
               blankly, and reads the next question on his list.

                                     JOHNSON
                         There have been a number of reports 
                         in reputable news media - Time, 
                         Newsweek, our own NBC - that you 
                         have gone way beyond the legal means 
                         available to a prosecutor, that you've 
                         intimidated and drugged witnesses, 
                         bribed them, urged them to commit 
                         perjury.  What is your response?

                                     JIM
                         Your faith in the veracity of the 
                         major media is touching, Jerry.  It 
                         indicates that the Age of Innocence 
                         is not yet over.  But seriously, 
                         Jerry, people aren't interested in 
                         Jim Garrison - they want the hard 
                         evidence!  They want to know why he 
                         was killed and what forces were 
                         opposed to...

                                     JOHNSON
                              (interrupting)
                         Some people would say you're paranoid.

                                     JIM
                         Well, if I am, why is the Government 
                         concealing evidence?

                                     JOHNSON
                         Are they?  Why would they?

                                     JIM
                              (pulling out his 
                              briefcase)
                         That's exactly my question, Jerry.  
                         Maybe I'd better show you some 
                         pictures so you can begin to 
                         understand what I am talking about.

               He pulls out a large blowup of the Allen photo of the three 
               hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera.

                                     JIM
                         These arrests were photographed 
                         minutes after the assassination, and 
                         were never shown to the American 
                         public.  They show...

               It takes Johnson a few moments to realize what's happening.  
               When he does, he lunges like a cobra for the photographs, 
               pulling Jim's arm down so the pictures are out of the camera's 
               view.

                                     JOHNSON
                              (sharply)
                         Pictures like this don't show up on 
                         television!

                                     JIM
                              (holding the picture 
                              up again)
                         Sure they do.  The camera can pick 
                         this up.

                                     JOHNSON
                              (yanking his arm down)
                         No, it can't!

               Jim swings the picture up a third time, but the stage director 
               gives a "cut" signal - finger across the throat - and the 
               red light on the camera blinks off.  The monitor shows another 
               camera panning the audience.

                                     JIM
                              (quickly realizes 
                              he's about to be cut 
                              off)
                         Those men you just saw were arrested 
                         in Dallas minutes after the 
                         assassination.  They were never seen 
                         again.  No record of arrest, no 
                         fingerprint, no mugshot, nothing.  
                         They all got away.

               The director frantically gives Johnson the "cut" sign.

                                     JOHNSON
                         We'll be back after these messages.

               The audience cheers as the commercial comes on.

               GARRISON'S HOME - (1968)

               Jim comes home.  His wife and two of the children are waiting 
               in the doorway.  They kiss.  Al Oser interrupts.

                                     AL
                         Jim, bad news.  Bill's turned, boss.  
                         I think he's given everything we've 
                         got to the Feds.

                         We studied the memos - there was 
                         nothing there, chief, nothing!  When 
                         we went to confront him, the landlady 
                         said that sonofabitch just took off, 
                         left everything.

                                     JIM
                         I know.

                              (to Jim)
                         I'm sorry.

                         Something sure scared him.

                                     JIM
                         Bill doesn't scare that easy.  
                         Somebody got to his thinking.  He 
                         was never that good a thinker.

               On the TV, the news is on.

                                     NEWSMAN 9
                         Much is at stake tonight in 
                         California.  Public opinion polls 
                         show Senator Robert Kennedy of New 
                         York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy 
                         of Minnesota.  Their anti-Vietnam 
                         War message is obviously striking a 
                         chord with the voters, and whoever 
                         wins tonight will certainly emerge 
                         as the favorite over Vice-President 
                         Humphrey to win the nomination in 
                         Chicago in August.  That man now 
                         seems to be Senator Kennedy.

               We see a shot of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles with his 
               supporters.

                                     NUMA
                         Sure sounds like he's winning.

                                     JIM
                         He'll never make it.  If he wins, 
                         they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge 
                         his brother.  He'll stop that war.  
                         No, they'll kill him before they let 
                         him become President.

               Liz shares a look with Al and Numa.

                                     AL
                         Boss, with Broussard they have 
                         everything.  All our witnesses, our 
                         strategy for the trial.  We'd have 
                         to doublecheck all his work, there 
                         could be false leads... we gotta 
                         rethink this trial.

               We don't have a choice.

                                     JIM
                         I don't think so, Al.  You remember 
                         the Hemingway story, "The Old Man 
                         and the Sea"?
                              (Al nods)
                         The old fisherman manages to catch 
                         this great fish - a fish so huge he 
                         has to tie it to the side of the 
                         boat to get it back in.  But by the 
                         time he reached shore, the fish had 
                         long since been picked apart by sharks 
                         and nothing was left but the skeleton.

                         Then what are we going through all 
                         this trouble for?

                                     JIM
                         It's a means to an end.  This war 
                         has two fronts - in the court of 
                         law, we hope, against the odds, to 
                         nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge.  
                         In the court of public opinion, it 
                         could take another 25 or 30 years 
                         for the truth to come out, but at 
                         least we're going to strike the first 
                         blow.

                         And if you're wrong?

                              (rising)
                         I never doubted for a second that I 
                         was.

                         I don't think so, Jim...

               She walks out.

               We see the outside of Jim's house and hear crickets chirping - 
               the purr of the suburb.  Inside, the TV election results are 
               still on.

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         With 53% of the precincts reporting, 
                         Senator Kennedy continues to hold a 
                         lead of 48% to 41% over Senator 
                         McCarthy.  CBS News has projected 
                         Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of 
                         the crucial California primary.

               Jim is in the kitchen fixing himself a sandwich.  There's a 
               strange feeling in the house.  We hear the wind - a shutter 
               sighing.  Jim suddenly doesn't feel alone in the kitchen.

                                     ROBERT KENNEDY
                              (voice over on TV)
                         ...and that is what has been going 
                         on within the United States over the 
                         last three years - the division, the 
                         violence, the disenchantment, whether 
                         it's between blacks and whites, 
                         between poor and the more affluent, 
                         or between age groups or the war in 
                         Vietnam - we can start to work 
                         together.  We are a great country, 
                         an unselfish country and a 
                         compassionate country.  I intend to 
                         make that my basis for running.

               He waves and leaves the podium, going back through the kitchen 
               of the hotel.  Jim is frozen in his spot, shaken.  The ghost 
               of Jack Kennedy - as he was before the killing - stares at 
               him through the kitchen, as if encased in a hologram.  The 
               hooded eyes watch Jim without expression.  They're 
               communicating, in some strange subliminal way.  Suddenly 
               shots ring out from the television and there's pandemonium.

                         SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT.

               The television shows a scene of confusion.  Jim walks out, 
               looking at the TV, struck down with his foreknowledge and 
               his inability to do anything about it.

               In their bedroom upstairs that night, Jim gently wakes Liz 
               and holds her.

                                     JIM
                         They killed him, honey.

                                     LIZ
                              (groggily)
                         Huh?

                                     JIM
                              (strangled)
                         He won... and they killed Robert 
                         Kennedy.  They shot him down.

                                     LIZ
                              (realizing, with terror)
                         Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I 
                         can't believe it.  Both of them, 
                         both brothers, oh my God!

               She clings to him, horrified.  He caresses her hair.  They 
               look in each other's eyes.

                                     LIZ
                         You're right, it hasn't ended, has 
                         it?

               He kisses her gently - They start to make love, numbed, 
               needing each other, needing their love in an increasingly 
               terrifying world.

                                     JIM
                              (awkward)
                         I wish I could've loved you more... 
                         I feel sometimes like I didn't ever.. 
                         love you or the children enough... 
                         I'm sorry.

               OUTSIDE THE COURTS BUILDING - NEW ORLEANS -(JAN. 1969)

               The scene is like a circus.  Armed, uniformed guards with 
               walkie-talkies are everywhere.  Guards with rifles are on 
               the rooftop.  There are crowds of reporters from around the 
               world and many onlookers.  Everyone going into the courtroom 
               is frisked by electronic metal detectors.

               INSIDE THE COURTROOM

               Jim, accompanied by Mattie, the maid, but not his wife, forges 
               his way through a tightly packed crowd to the prosecution 
               table, joining Al, Susie, Numa, and others from his team.  
               Young law student have come to watch.  The crowd is noisy to 
               the point of unruliness.  Suddenly there's a hush as everyone 
               cranes their necks to see Clay Shaw and his attorneys, Irvin 
               Dymond and two others, enter the court.  Shaw, impeccably 
               dressed, his high handsome cheekbones sucking on an ever- 
               present cigarette in a porcelain filter (smoking in court 
               was allowed then), smiles to those who greet him as if they 
               were not really there and limps past Jim with a stony 
               indifference.

               The clerk starts pounding the gavel to call the court to 
               order as Judge Edward Aloysius Haggerty sweeps in and takes 
               the bench.  He's a stocky little Jimmy Cagney look alike 
               with fierce blue eyes under bushy brows.  The jurors - nine 
               white men and three black men - all dressed in suits and 
               ties, look on.

               CUT TO Willie O'Keefe pointing out Clay Shaw.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         That's Clay Bertrand.  That's the 
                         man I saw at David Ferrie's.

               Irvin Dymond cross-examines O'Keefe.

                                     DYMOND
                              (words wafting)
                         That's who you say you saw... a 
                         confessed homosexual, convicted of 
                         solicitation, pandering... a man who 
                         has lied about most everything, who...

               TIME CUT TO Vernon Bundy, a poor black man, who points at 
               Shaw.

                                     BUNDY
                         It was that man there, yessir.  He 
                         was at the Pontchartrain wall with 
                         the man who shot the President.  I 
                         remember him cause o' his limp there.

                                     DYMOND
                         A heroin addict, injecting himself 
                         at the wall, barely conscious...

               TIME CUT TO Jim looking over at a strange man, Matthews, a 
               kind of lawyer, making notes and conferring with Shaw and 
               Dymond.  Matthews seems to have some authority over both 
               men.

               Corrie Collins, a black woman who is one of the CORE workers 
               from Clinton, is on the stand.

                                     COLLINS
                              (pointing at Shaw)
                         ...that was the man there.  He dropped 
                         Oswald off on the voter line.  I 
                         remember 'cause they were the only 
                         white strangers around that morning.  
                         That big, black Cadillac of his made 
                         me think they might be FBI.

               TIME CUT TO the Town Marshall on the stand.

                                     TOWN MARSHALL
                              (looking at Shaw)
                         ...said he was a representative of 
                         one International Trade Mart in New 
                         Orleans.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...more than five years ago, for two 
                         minutes.  It's fair to say you could 
                         be mistaken, isn't it?

               TIME CUT TO Dymond cross-examining Dean Andrews, shaking his 
               head.

                                     ANDREWS
                         ...figment of my imagination... The 
                         cat's stewing me, the oyster's 
                         shucking me I told him, you got the 
                         right at-at but the wrong oh-oh...  
                         Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor 
                         and you can tell him I said so...

                                     SUSIE
                              (counter-arguing)
                         Objection, your Honor.  This office 
                         has won a conviction of perjury 
                         against Dean Andrews on this matter.

                                     DYMOND
                         Exception taken.  That case is on 
                         appeal!

               Arguments follow.

               TIME CUT TO Charles Goldberg, a mild-looking New York 
               accountant, on the stand with Dymond cross-examing.

                                     DYMOND
                              (relishing this)
                         Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David 
                         Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a 
                         vacation here from your accounting 
                         business in New York, you had drinks 
                         and, under the influence discussed 
                         killing Kennedy, is that not so?

                                     GOLDBERG
                         I did.

                                     DYMOND
                         Why?

                                     GOLDBERG
                         Well, I wanted to make sure she's 
                         the same girl I sent.

                                     DYMOND
                         I see... and why are you experiencing 
                         this paranoia?

                                     GOLDBERG
                              (launching into his 
                              explanation)
                         Well, you see, I've been subject to 
                         hypnosis and psychological warfare 
                         ever since 1948, when I was in 
                         Korea...

               We see the faces of people in the courtroom... the judge's 
               face... obviously Goldberg is disturbed (or maybe he is 
               telling the truth, but it doesn't play well)... Jim looks at 
               Al sickly.

                                     AL
                         He was one of Broussard's witnesses, 
                         chief.  I'm sorry.  He was totally 
                         sane when we took his affidavit.

                                     SUSIE
                         But how does Dymond know what to 
                         ask?  FUCK!  We're dead.

                                     GOLDBERG
                         When someone tries to get your 
                         attention - catch your eye - that's 
                         a clue right off.

               TIME CUT TO Jim calling Officer Habighorst to testify.

                                     GARRISON
                         Your Honor, I call police officer 
                         Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand.

               Habighorst, the clean-cut police officer who booked Clay 
               Shaw on the day of his arrest, starts forward.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         I'm going to have to ask the jury to 
                         leave the courtroom.

                                     GARRISON
                         What?

               This is an ugly surprise for Jim.  We see him at the bench 
               arguing loudly with the judge.  Susie, Dymond and Al are 
               also there.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         I'm sorry, Jim, but the defendant 
                         did not have his lawyer present when 
                         asked.

               FLASHBACK TO 1967, in the New Orleans police station.  Shaw 
               is being booked.  The press is there and Habighorst is 
               questioning him.

                                     HABIGHORST
                         Any alias?

                                     SHAW
                         Clay Bertrand.

               We see a close-up on Habighorst typing this in.

                                     GARRISON (V.O.)
                         Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's 
                         been standard booking procedure to 
                         ask an alias.  You know that.  There's 
                         no constitutional requirement that 
                         says a lawyer has to be present for 
                         routine questions.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm 
                         ruling it inadmissible.

                                     GARRISON
                         That's our case!

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         If that's your case, you didn't have 
                         a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever 
                         Habighorst said, anyway.

                                     GARRISON
                         I can't believe you're saying this 
                         in the courtroom.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                              (feistier)
                         Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the 
                         jury.

                                     AL
                         We're filing for a writ to the 
                         appellate court.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         You do that.

               Dymond goes back to Shaw, very please.  Shaw smokes, icy.  
               Jim, devastated, sits, feeling it's over.

               CUT TO Clay Shaw on the stand.  Dymond cross-examines him.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...Oswald?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I did not.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...ever called Dean Andrews?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I did not.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?

                                     SHAW
                              (with a smirk of 
                              amusement)
                         No, I would not even know what he 
                         looked like except for the pictures 
                         I've been shown.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...did you ever use the alias Clay 
                         Bertrand?

                         No, I did not.

                                     DYMOND
                         Thank you... Mr. Shaw.

               Jim rises slowly out of his chair.

                                     JIM
                         Well, a very great actor has just 
                         given us a great performance, Your 
                         Honor, but we are nowhere closer to 
                         the truth.  Let it be noted, my office 
                         is charging Clay Shaw with outright 
                         perjury on the fifteen answers he 
                         has given, not one word of this...

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         You're out of order, Jim Boy, now 
                         sit down.  Strike those remarks!!

               CUT TO later in the trial.  A movie screen has been installed 
               for the jury.  Jim paces dramatically, as if waiting, casting 
               looks at the door.  Members of the press pack the hot room, 
               and a fan turns overhead.

                                     JIM
                         To prove their was a conspiracy 
                         involving Clay Shaw we must prove 
                         there was more than one man involved 
                         in the assassination.  To do that, 
                         we must look at the Zapruder film, 
                         which my office has subpoenaed.  The 
                         American public has not seen that 
                         film because it has been kept locked 
                         in a vault in the Time-Life Building 
                         in New York City for the last five 
                         years.  There is a reason for that.  
                         Watch.

               The Zapruder film (8mm) now rolls.  We have seen pieces of 
               it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole.  
               It is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several 
               times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily 
               lost on casual viewing.  The first viewing is silent except 
               for the sound of the clanky projector.  It lasts about 25 
               seconds, and then the lights come on.  The jury is shaken.  
               The judge is shaken.  The people in the courtroom murmur.  
               Even Clay Shaw is surprised at what he has seen.  Jim says 
               nothing, letting the truth of it sink in.  Then:

                                     JIM
                         A picture speaks a thousand words.  
                         Yet sometimes the truth is too simple 
                         for some...  The Warren Commission 
                         thought they had an open and shut 
                         case: three bullets, one assassin - 
                         but two things happened that made it 
                         virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder 
                         film which you just saw, and 2)the 
                         third wounded man, Jim Tague, who 
                         was nicked by a fragment down by the 
                         Triple Underpass.  The time frame of 
                         5.6 seconds established by the 
                         Zapruder film left no possibility of 
                         a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle, 
                         but the shot or fragment that left a 
                         superficial wound on Tague's cheek 
                         had to come from a bullet that missed 
                         the car entirely.  Now they had two 
                         bullets that hit, and we know one of 
                         them was the fatal head shot.  So a 
                         single bullet remained to account 
                         for all seven wounds in Kennedy and 
                         Connally.  But rather than admit to 
                         a conspiracy or investigate further, 
                         the Commission chose to endorse the 
                         theory put forth by an ambitious 
                         junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.  
                         One of the grossest lies ever forced 
                         on the American people, we've come 
                         to know it as the "magic bullet" 
                         theory.

               CUT TO a drawing which has been put on a chair for the Jury.  
               Jim has also moved Al, acting as J.F.K., into a chair directly 
               behind the larger Numa, acting as Governor Connally.  He 
               demonstrates with a pointer.

                                     JIM
                         The magic bullet enters the 
                         President's back, headed downward at 
                         an angle of 17 degrees.  It then 
                         moves upward in order to leave 
                         Kennedy's body from the front of his 
                         neck - his neck wound number two - 
                         where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns 
                         right and continues into Connally's 
                         body at the rear of his right armpit - 
                         wound number three.  Then, the bullet 
                         heads downward at an angle of 27 
                         degrees, shattering Connally's fifth 
                         rib and leaving from the right side 
                         of his chest - wounds four and five.  
                         The bullet continues downward and 
                         then enters Connally's right wrist - 
                         wound number six - shattering the 
                         radius bone.  It then enters his 
                         left thigh - wound number seven - 
                         from which it later falls out and is 
                         found in almost "pristine" condition 
                         on a stretcher in a corridor of 
                         Parkland Hospital.
                              (he shows a mock-up 
                              of the "pristine" 
                              bullet)
                         That's some bullet.  Anyone who's 
                         been in combat can tell you never in 
                         the history of gunfire has there 
                         been a bullet like this.
                              (the court laughs)
                         The Army Wound Ballistics experts at 
                         Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison 
                         bullets and not one of them looked 
                         anything like this one.
                              (he shows mock-ups of 
                              comparison bullets)
                         Take a look at CE 856, an identical 
                         bullet fired through the wrist of a 
                         human cadaver - just one of the bones 
                         smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet 
                         the government says it can prove 
                         this with some fancy physics in a 
                         nuclear laboratory.  Of course they 
                         can.  Theoretical physics can prove 
                         an elephant can hang from a cliff 
                         with it's tail tied to a daisy, but 
                         use your eyes - your common sense -
                              (he holds the bullet)
                         Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single 
                         bullet explanation is the foundation 
                         of the Warren Commission's claim of 
                         a lone assassin.  And once you 
                         conclude the magic bullet could not 
                         create all seven of those wounds, 
                         you have to conclude there was a 
                         fourth shot and a second rifleman.  
                         And if there was a second rifleman, 
                         there had to be a conspiracy, which 
                         we believe involved the accused Clay 
                         Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen 
                         of the jury, thought they heard shots 
                         coming from the Grassy Knoll, which 
                         is to the right and front of the 
                         President.

               Jim walks to a drawing of an overhead view of Dealey Plaza.  
               On it are dots representing locations of the witnesses. He 
               points to each portion.  He pauses and looks out into the 
               courtroom - Liz has entered accompanied by Jasper.  Quietly 
               she takes a seat.  Jim is unbelieving at first, then very 
               moved.  He takes a beat, then:

                         Zapruder, James Simmons - each of 
                         these witnesses has no doubt 
                         whatsoever one or more shots came 
                         from behind the picket fence!  Twenty 
                         six trained medical personnel at 
                         Parkland Hospital saw with their own 
                         eyes the back of the President's 
                         head blasted out.

                              head)
                         ...had been blasted out along with 
                         the brain tissue there.  The exit 
                         hole in the rear of his head was 
                         about 120 mm. across.  There was 
                         also a large piece of skull attached 
                         to a flap of skin in the right 
                         temporal area.

               FLASHBACK TO: Parkland Hospital Emergency Room on that day 
               in 1963.  The doctors work on the President.  The wounds on 
               the back of his head are evident but will change later in 
               the autopsy.  He is placed in a bronze casket.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Not one of the civilian doctors who 
                         examined the President at Parkland 
                         Hospital regarded his throat wound 
                         as anything but a wound of entry.  
                         The doctors found no wounds of entry 
                         in the back of the head.  But the 
                         body was then illegally moved to 
                         Washington for the autopsy.

               out.  The Dallas Medical Examiner, Dr. Rose, backed by a

                         occurred there's a big difference 
                         between an autopsy performed by 
                         civilian doctors and one by military

                         On the plane, of course, Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald's guilt was announced by the 
                         White House Situation Room to the 
                         passengers before any kind of 
                         investigation had started.  The "lone 
                         nut" solution is in place.

                         Objection!  Your Honor!

                                     JUDGE
                         Sustained.  Mr. Garrison, would you 
                         please bottle the acid.

               FLASHBACK TO: the Bethesda autopsy room in 1963.  The room 
               is crammed with military officers, Secret Service men and, 
               at the center, three intimidated doctors.  Pictures are being 
               taken as they remove bullet fragments.

                                     JIM
                         The three Bethesda Naval Hospital 
                         doctors picked by the Military left 
                         something to be desired inasmuch as 
                         none of them had experience with 
                         combat gunfire wounds.  Through their 
                         autopsy we have been able to justify 
                         eight wounds - three to Kennedy, 
                         five to Connally - from just two 
                         bullets, one of these bullets the 
                         "magic bullet".

               CUT TO: Jim in court with a series of drawings indicating 
               with arrows entry and exit wounds to Kennedy's neck and head.  
               Dr. Finck is on the stand, erect, very precise, and irritated.

                                     JIM
                         Colonel Finck, are you saying someone 
                         told you not to dissect the neck?

                                     FINCK
                         I was told that the family wanted 
                         examination of the head.

                                     JIM
                         As a pathologist it was your 
                         obligation to explore all possible 
                         causes of death, was it not?

                                     FINCK
                         I had the cause of death.

                                     JIM
                         Your Honor, I would ask you to direct 
                         the witness to answer my question.  
                         Why did Colonel Finck not dissect 
                         the track of the bullet wound in the 
                         neck?

                                     FINCK
                         Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - 
                         he said...

               FLASHBACK TO: Bethesda autopsy room.

                                     HUMES
                         Who's in charge here?

                                     ARMY GENERAL
                         I am.

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         I don't remember his name.  You must 
                         understand it was quite crowded, and 
                         when you are called in circumstances 
                         like that to look at the wound of 
                         the President who is dead, you don't 
                         look around too much to ask people 
                         for their names and who they are.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         But you were a qualified pathologist.  
                         Was this Army general a qualified 
                         pathologist?

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         No.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         But you took his orders.  He was 
                         directing the autopsy.

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         No, because there were others.  There 
                         were admirals.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         There were admirals.

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         Oh yes, there were admirals - and 
                         when you are a lieutenant colonel in 
                         the Army you just follow orders, and 
                         at the end of the autopsy we were 
                         specifically told - as I recall it 
                         was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon 
                         General of the Navy - we were 
                         specifically told not to discuss the 
                         case.

                                     KENNEY
                              (in Bethesda scene)
                         Gentlemen, what you've seen in this 
                         room is intensely private to the 
                         Kennedy family and it is not our 
                         business to...

               Jim turns away from the jury.  His point is made.  Finck is 
               no longer on the stand.

                                     JIM
                         In addition to which, 1) the chief 
                         pathologist, Commander Humes, by his 
                         own admission voluntarily burned his 
                         autopsy notes, 2)never released the 
                         autopsy photos to the public, 3) 
                         President Johnson ordered the blood 
                         soaked limousine filled with bullet 
                         holes and clues to be immediately 
                         washed and rebuilt, 4) sent John 
                         Connally's bloody suit right to the 
                         cleaners, and 5) when my office 
                         finally got a court order to examine 
                         President Kennedy's brain in the 
                         National Archives in the hopes of 
                         finding from what direction the 
                         bullets came, we were told by the 
                         government the President's brain had 
                         disappeared!

               There's a pause, and then a murmur from the court.  Jim is 
               on a roll and knows it.  The faces in the courtroom are with 
               him, absorbed, horrified.  The law students are still there, 
               they have been since day one.  But it is Liz's interest that 
               touches him the most.

                                     JIM
                         So what really happened that day?  
                         Let's just for a moment speculate, 
                         shall we?  We have the epileptic 
                         seizure around 12:15 P.M.... 
                         distracting the police, making it 
                         easier for the shooters to move into 
                         their places.  The epileptic later 
                         vanished, never checking into the 
                         hospital.  The A Team gets on the 
                         6th floor of the Book Depository...

               FLASHBACK TO: the Book Depository, 1963.  A shooter and two 
               spotters dressed as working men move into the Oswald spot.  
               One spotter produces the Mannlicher-Carcano.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         They were refurbishing the floors in 
                         the Depository that week, which 
                         allowed unknown workmen in and out 
                         of the building.  The men move quickly 
                         into position just minutes before 
                         the shooting.

               The camera takes the shooter's point of view: we see down 
               the street through a scope.  His spotter wears a radio 
               earpiece.  The second spotter is working out of the southeast 
               window.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The second spotter is probably calling 
                         all the shots on a radio to the two 
                         other teams.  He as the best overall 
                         view - "the God spot".

               Inside the Dal-Tex Building, a shooter and a spotter dressed 
               as air-conditioning men move into a small second-story textile 
               storage room.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         B Team - one rifleman and one spotter 
                         with a headset, with access to the 
                         building - moves into a low floor of 
                         the Dal-Tex Building.

               At the picket fence a shooter in a Dallas Police uniform 
               moves into place, aiming up Elm Street.  His spotter has a 
               radio to his ear.  Another man in a Secret Service suit moves 
               further down the fence.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The third team, the C Team, moves in 
                         behind the picket fence above the 
                         Grassy Knoll, where the shooter and 
                         the spotter are first seen by the 
                         late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of 
                         the railyard.  They have the best 
                         position of all.  Kennedy is close 
                         and on a flat low trajectory.

               Part of this team is a coordinator who's flashed security 
               credentials at several people, chasing them out of the parking 
               lot area.

               An "agent" in tie and suit moves on the underpass, keeping 
               an eye out.

               In the crowd on Elm Street, we catch brief glimpses of the 
               umbrella man and the Cuban, neither of them watching Kennedy, 
               both looking around to their teams.  There is a third man, 
               heavyset, in a construction helmet.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Probably two to three more men are 
                         down in the crowd on Elm... ten to 
                         twelve men... three teams, three 
                         shooters.  The triangulation of fire 
                         Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed 
                         two months before.  They've walked 
                         the Plaza, they know every inch.  
                         They've calibrated their sights, 
                         practiced on moving targets.  They're 
                         ready.  It's going to be a turkey 
                         shoot.  Kennedy's motorcade makes 
                         the turn from Main onto Houston.

               J.F.K. waves and turns in slow motion.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Six witnesses see two gunmen on the 
                         sixth floor of the Depository moving 
                         around.  Some of them think they're 
                         policemen with rifles.

               From Houston Street we look up at the sixth floor of the 
               Book Depository and see the shooter moving around.  Arnold 
               Rowland points him out to his wife.

                         ...probably a security agent.

               In the Dallas County Jail, Johnny Powell is one of many 
               convicts housed on the sixth floor - the same height as the 
               men in the Book Depository.  We look across to the Depository 
               through cell bars.  Johnny and various cell mates are watching 
               two men in the sixth floor of the Depository.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth 
                         floor of the Dallas County Jail, 
                         sees them.

                         and that.  We thought is was security 
                         guys...

                         ...they don't shoot him coming up 
                         Houston, which is the easiest shot 
                         for a single shooter in the Book 
                         Depository, but they wait till he 
                         gets to the killing zone between 
                         three rifles.  Kennedy makes the 
                         final turn from Houston onto Elm, 
                         slowing down to some 11 miles per 
                         hour.

               All the shooters tighten, taking aim.  It's a tense moment.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The shooters across Dealey Plaza 
                         tighten, taking their aim across 
                         their sights...  waiting for the 
                         radio to say "Green Green!" or "Abort 
                         Abort!"

               The camera is on Kennedy waving.  A MONTAGE follows - all 
               the faces in the square that we've introduced in the movie 
               now appear one after the other, watching - the killers, the 
               man with the umbrella, the Newman family, Mary Moorman 
               photographing, Jean Hill, Abraham Zapruder filming it, S.M. 
               Holland, Patrolman Harkness... INTERCUT with the Zapruder 
               and Nix films on J.F.K. in the final seconds coming abreast 
               of the Stemmons Freeway sign.

                         The first shot rings out.

               CUT TO the Dal-Tex shooter firing.  We see the back of 
               Kennedy's through his gun sight.  Kennedy (stand in) reacts 
               in the Zapruder film.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Sounding like a backfire, it misses 
                         completely... Frame 161, Kennedy 
                         stops waving as he hears something.  
                         Connally turns his head slightly to 
                         the right.

               Everything goes off very fast now.  Repeating intercuts are 
               slowed down with shots of Kennedy reacting in the Zapruder 
               film.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Frame 193 - the second shot hits 
                         Kennedy in the throat from the front.  
                         Frame 225 - the President emerging 
                         from the road sign.  He obviously 
                         has been hit, raising his arms to 
                         his throat.

               CUT TO: the picket fence shooter hitting him from the fence.  
               We see Kennedy (stand in) from the point of view of his 
               telescopic sight.  In the Zapruder film, we see Kennedy clutch 
               his throat.

                                     JIM
                         Frame 232, the third shot - the 
                         President has been hit in the back, 
                         drawing him downward and forward.  
                         Connally, you will notice, shows no 
                         signs at all of being hit.  He is 
                         visibly holding his Stetson which is 
                         impossible if his wrist has been 
                         shattered.

               CUT TO: the Dal-Tex shooter.  We see Kennedy from his point 
               of view, and the Zapruder film in slow motion.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Connally's turning now here.  Frame 
                         238... the fourth shot misses Kennedy 
                         and takes Connally in the back.  
                         This is the key shot that proves two 
                         rifles from the rear.  This is 1.6 
                         seconds after the third shot, and we 
                         know no manual bolt action rifle can 
                         be recycled in that time.  Connally 
                         is hit, his mouth drops, he yells 
                         out, "My God, they're going to kill 
                         us all"... Here...

               CUT TO: the sixth floor shooter firing rapidly and missing 
               Kennedy but hitting Connally (stand in).

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...the umbrella man is signalling 
                         "He's not dead.  Keep shooting."  
                         James Tague down at the underpass is 
                         hit sometime now by another shot 
                         that misses.

               CUT TO: the umbrella man pumping his umbrella.  The Cuban is 
               looking off.  The man on the curb in the construction helmet 
               is looking not at J.F.K. but up at the Book Depository.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The car brakes.  The fifth and fatal 
                         shot - frame 313 - takes Kennedy in 
                         the head from the front...

               CUT TO the picket fence shooter.  We see J.F.K. from his 
               point of view.  He fires, and then we see Kennedy in the 
               Zapruder film flying backwards and to his left in a ferocious, 
               conclusive spray of blood and brain tissue.  We repeat the 
               shot.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         This is the key shot.  Watch it again.  
                         The President going back to his left.
                         Shot from the front and right.  
                         Totally inconsistent with the shot 
                         from the Depository.  Again - 
                         (repeats)... back and two the left.  
                         (he repeats it like a mantra)... 
                         back and to the left...  back and to 
                         the left.

               Kennedy's car speeds off.  Jackie is like a crawling animal 
               in a pillbox hat on the back of the car.  The people on the 
               other side of the underpass wave innocently as the car speeds 
               through with it's horrifying contents.  Pigeons fly off the 
               rooftop of the Book Depository.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         What happens then?  Pandemonium.  
                         The shooters quickly disassemble 
                         their various weapons, all except 
                         the Oswald rifle.

               CUT TO: sixth floor spotter dumping the Mannlicher - Carcano 
               in a corner as he leaves... and then to the Dal-Tex spotter 
               and shooter, who break down the gun and move out... and then 
               to the spotter with the fence shooter, who quickly breaks 
               down the weapon, throwing it in the trunk of a car parked at 
               the fence.  He walks away.  The fence shooter, dressed as a 
               policeman, blends with the crowd.

               CUT TO: the umbrella man and the Cuban sitting quietly 
               together on the north side of the curb of Elm Street.

               CUT TO: stunned, confused, people in the crowd - some lying 
               on the ground, some running for the Grassy Knoll.

               Back in the courtroom, patrolman Joe Smith is on the stand.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Patrolman Joe Smith rushed into the 
                         parking lot behind the fence.  He 
                         smelled gunpowder.

               FLASHBACK TO: the picket fence area where, with his gun drawn, 
               Smith rushes across to a man standing by a car who reacts 
               quickly, producing credentials.  He is one of the hoboes.  
               There's a strange moment when the camera moves from Smith's 
               eyes to the man's fingernails.

                                     SMITH (V.O.)
                         ...the character produces credentials 
                         from his pocket which showed him to 
                         be Secret Service.  So I accepted 
                         that and let him go and continued 
                         our search.  But I regretted it, 
                         'cause this guy looked like an auto 
                         mechanic.  He had on a sports shirt 
                         and pants, but he had dirty 
                         fingernails.  Afterwards it didn't 
                         ring true, but at the time we were 
                         so pressed for time.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Yet all Secret Servicemen in Dallas 
                         that day are accounted for.  None 
                         were on foot in Dealey Plaza before 
                         or after the shooting, till Dallas 
                         Secret Service Chief Forrest Sorrels 
                         returned at 12:55.

               Back in the courtroom, Liz is totally absorbed.  Jim exchanges 
               looks with her.  The camera movies in for a close - up of 
               Jim.

                                     JIM
                              (pausing for effect)
                         What else was going on in Dealey 
                         Plaza that day?  At least 12 other 
                         individuals were taken into custody 
                         by Dallas police.  No records of 
                         their arrests.  Men acting like hoboes 
                         were being pulled off trains, marched 
                         through Dealey Plaza, photographed, 
                         and yet there is no records of their 
                         arrests.

               FLASHBACK TO: the three hoboes being arrested ... marching 
               across Dealey Plaza.  The hoboes look familiar now.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Men identifying themselves as Secret 
                         Service Agents were all over the 
                         place.  But who was impersonating 
                         them?

               FLASHBACK TO: men in suits, ties, and hats moving people out 
               of the parking lot area ... turning a policeman back.

               FLASHBACK TO: the Cuban, putting away a radio, and the 
               umbrella man, who now rise and leave the area in opposite 
               directions.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         And where was Lee Oswald?  Probably 
                         in the second floor snack room.  
                         Eddie Piper and William Shelly saw 
                         Oswald eating lunch in the first 
                         floor lunch room around twelve.  
                         Around 12:15, on her way out of the 
                         building to see the motorcade, 
                         secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald 
                         in the second floor snack room, where 
                         he said he went for a Coke...

               In the second floor lunchroom of the Book Depository we see 
               Carolyn Arnold, a pregnant secretary, crossing past Oswald, 
               who is in a booth.

                                     CAROLYN ARNOLD (V.O.)
                         He was sitting in one of the booths 
                         on the right hand side of the room.  
                         He was alone as usual and appeared 
                         to be having lunch.  I did not speak 
                         to him but I recognized clearly.  I 
                         remember it was 12:15 or later.  It 
                         coulda been 12:25, five minutes before 
                         the assassination, I don't exactly 
                         remember.  I was pregnant and I had 
                         a craving for a glass of water.

               On the sixth floor of the depository, Bonnie Ray Williams is 
               eating a chicken lunch, alone.

                                     JIM
                              (VO)
                         At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams 
                         is supposedly eating his chicken 
                         lunch on the sixth floor, at least 
                         until 12:15, maybe 12:20 ... he sees 
                         nobody.

               On the street, Arnold Rowland and his wife look up at the 
               sixth floor windows and we see, from their point of view, 
               two shadowy figures...

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Down on the street, Arnold Rowland 
                         was seeing two men in the sixth floor 
                         windows... presumably after Bonnie 
                         Ray Williams finished his lunch and 
                         left.

               We see footage of J.F.K. coming up Houston - waving.

               Oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman 
               Marrion Baker runs in, gun at his side.  He is about 30 feet 
               from Oswald.  Roy Truly, the superintendent, runs in a moment 
               later.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Kennedy was running five minutes 
                         late for his appointment with death.  
                         He was due at 12:25.  If Oswald was 
                         the assassin, he was certainly pretty 
                         non-chalant about getting himself 
                         into position.  Later he told Dallas 
                         police he was standing in the second 
                         floor snackroom.  Probably told to 
                         wait there for a phone call by his 
                         handler.  The phones were in the 
                         adjacent and empty second floor 
                         offices, but the call never came.  A 
                         maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is 
                         shot, patrolman Marrion Baker runs 
                         into Oswald in that second story 
                         lunchroom.

                                     BAKER
                         Hey you!
                              (to Truly)
                         Do you know this man?  Is he an 
                         employee?

                                     TRULY
                         Yes he is.
                              (as Baker moves on)
                         The President's been shot!

               Oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time.  Truly 
               and Baker continue running up the stairs.  Oswald proceeds 
               to get a Coke and continues out of the room.

               CUT TO: the sixth floor, where we see Oswald as the shooter.  
               After firing, he runs full speed for the stairs, stashing 
               the rifle on the other side of the loft.  Our camera follows 
               him roughly down stairs - we hear the loud sound of his shoes 
               banging on the hollow wood - to the lunchroom, where Patrolman 
               Baker and Superintendent Truly run in.  Then they start to 
               repeat the same action as seen in the previous scene.

                         ...but what the Warren Report would 
                         have us believe is that after firing 
                         3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds, 
                         Oswald then leaves three cartridges 
                         neatly side by side in the firing 
                         nest, wipes the rifle clear of 
                         fingerprints, stashes the rifle on 
                         the other side of the loft, sprints 
                         down five flights of stairs, past 
                         witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra 
                         Styles who never see him, and then 
                         shows up cool and calm on the second 
                         floor in front of Patrolman Baker -
                         all this within a maximum 90 seconds 
                         of the shooting.  Is he out of breath?  
                         According to Baker, absolutely not.

               CUT TO: the second floor.  Oswald ambles past Mrs. Reid, a 
               secretary in the second floor office, on his way out, Coke 
               bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look... there's 
               a lingering close - up on his face.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Assuming he is the sole assassin, 
                         Oswald is now free to escape from 
                         the building.  The longer he delays, 
                         the more chance the building will be 
                         sealed by the police.  Is he guilty?  
                         Does he walk out the nearest 
                         staircase?  No, he buys a Coke and 
                         at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid 
                         in the second floor office, he strolls 
                         out the more distant front exit, 
                         where the cops start to gather...

               Outside, we see Oswald stroll out the door of the Book 
               Depository into the crowd.  He heads for the bus stop to the 
               east.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Oddly, considering three shots are 
                         supposed to have come from there, 
                         nobody seals the Depository for ten 
                         more minutes.  Oswald slips out, as 
                         do several other employees.  Of 
                         course, when he realized something 
                         had gone wrong and the President 
                         really had been shot, he knew there 
                         was a problem.  He may even have 
                         known he was the patsy.  An intuition 
                         maybe - the President killed in spite 
                         of his warning.  The phone call that 
                         never came.  Perhaps fear now came 
                         to Lee Oswald.  He wasn't going to 
                         stand around for roll call.

               Back in the courtroom, Jim continues speaking:

                                     JIM
                         The story gets pretty confusing now - 
                         more twists in it than a watersnake.  
                         Richard Carr says he saw four men 
                         take off from the Book Depository in 
                         a Rambler that possibly belongs to 
                         Janet Williams.  Deputy Roger Craig 
                         says two men picked up Oswald in the 
                         same Rambler a few minutes later.  
                         Other people say Oswald took a bus 
                         out of there, and then because he 
                         was stuck in traffic, he hopped a 
                         cab to his rooming house in Oak 
                         Cliff...

               FLASHBACK TO: Oswald's boarding house.  Oswald enters his 
               room, passing Earlene Roberts, the heavyset white housekeeper.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...we must assume he wanted to get 
                         back in touch with his intell team, 
                         probably at a safehouse or at the 
                         Texas Theatre, but how could he be 
                         sure?  He didn't know who to trust 
                         anymore...

                                     ROBERTS
                              (watching TV)
                         My God, did you see that, Mr. Lee?  
                         A man shot the President.

               The camera closes in on Oswald's perplexed face.  Earlene 
               peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn.

               Outside is a black police car driven by Tippit.  Also in the 
               car is the fence shooter, dressed as a Dallas policeman.  
               The car drives by, honks twice, waits, then moves away.  
               During this visual, we see the fence shooter changing his 
               uniform into civilian clothes.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Oswald returns to this rooming house 
                         around 1 P.M., half hour after the 
                         assassination, puts on his jacket, 
                         grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at 
                         1:04... Earlene Roberts, the 
                         housekeeper, says she heard two beeps 
                         on a car horn and two uniformed cops 
                         pulled up to the house while Oswald 
                         was in his room, like it was a signal 
                         or something... Officer Tippit is 
                         shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a 
                         mile away.  Though no one actually 
                         saw him walking or jogging, the 
                         Government says Oswald covered that 
                         distance.  Incidentally, that walk, 
                         if he did it, is in a straight line 
                         toward Jack Ruby's house.  Giving 
                         the government the benefit of the 
                         doubt, Oswald would have had to jog 
                         a mile in six to eleven minutes and 
                         commit the murder, then reverse 
                         direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to 
                         the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime 
                         before 1:30.  That's some walking.

               On a street, Oswald walks alone, fast.  A police car pulls 
               up alongside him on 10th Street.  Oswald leans on the 
               passenger side of the window.  Officer Tippit, suspicious, 
               gets out to question him.  Oswald pulls his .38 revolver and 
               shoots him down in the street with 5 shots.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         It's also a useful conclusion.  After 
                         all, why else would Oswald kill 
                         Officer Tippit, unless he just shot 
                         the President and feared arrest?  
                         Not one credible witness could 
                         identify Oswald as Tippit's killer.

               Domingo Benavides, hidden in his truck only a few yards away, 
               watches as another unidentified man (not seen before) shoots 
               and walks away.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Domingo Benavides, the closest witness 
                         to the shooting, refused to identify 
                         Oswald as the killer and was never 
                         taken to a lineup.

               We see Acquilla Clemons, a black woman, looking on.  She 
               watches as two men kill Tippit.  One of them resembles the 
               fence shooter.  The other one is a mystery figure, seen before 
               in the fringes.  The men walk off quickly in opposite 
               directions.  We notice a policeman's uniform hanging in the 
               back seat of Tippit's car.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with 
                         another man and says they went off 
                         in separate directions.  Mrs. Clemons 
                         was never taken to lineup or to the 
                         Warren Commission.  Mr.  Frank Wright, 
                         who saw the killer run away, stated 
                         flatly that the killer was not Lee 
                         Oswald.  Oswald is found with a .38 
                         revolver.  Tippit is killed with a 
                         .38 automatic.  At the scene of the 
                         crime Officer J.M. Poe marks the 
                         shells with his initials to record 
                         the chain of evidence.

                         Those initials are not on the three 
                         cartridge cases which the Warren 
                         Commission presents to him.

               On a Dallas avenue near the Texas Theatre, Oswald moves along, 
               spooked.  Police cars roar by with sirens blaring.  Johnny 
               Brewer, in a shoestore, spots him and follows him.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman 
                         Johnny Brewer lurking along Jefferson 
                         Avenue.  Oswald is scared.  He begins 
                         to realize the full implications of 
                         this thing.  He goes into the Texas 
                         Theatre, possibly his prearranged 
                         meeting point, but though he has $14 
                         in his pocket, he does not buy the 
                         75-cent ticket.  Brewer has the 
                         cashier call the police.

               Outside the Texas Theatre Oswald walks past the cashier, who 
               is out on the sidewalk watching the police cars go by.  A 
               double feature is playing - Cry of Battle with Van Heflin 
               and War is Hell.  He goes in.

               CUT TO: 30 officers arriving at the theatre in a fleet of 
               patrol cars.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         In response to the cashier's call, 
                         at least thirty officers in a fleet 
                         of patrol cars descend on the movie 
                         theatre.  This has to be the most 
                         remarkable example of police intuition 
                         since the Reichstag fire.  I don't 
                         buy it.  They knew - someone knew - 
                         Oswald was going to be there.  In 
                         fact, as early as 12:44, only 14 
                         minutes after the assassination, the 
                         police radio put out a description 
                         matching Oswald's size and build.  
                         Brewer says the man was wearing a 
                         jacket, but the police say the man 
                         who shot Tippit left his jacket 
                         behind.  Butch Burroughs, theatre 
                         manager, says Oswald bought some 
                         popcorn from him at the time of the 
                         Tippit slaying.  Burroughs and witness 
                         Bernard Haire also said there was an 
                         Oswald look - alike taken from the 
                         theatre.  Perhaps it was he who 
                         sneaked into the theatre just after 
                         1:30.

               Inside the theatre, Cry of Battle is on the screen.  Twelve 
               to fourteen spectators sit scattered between the balcony and 
               ground floor.  Brewer leads the officers onto the stage and 
               the lights come on.  He points to Oswald.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         In any case, Brewer helpfully leads 
                         the cops into the theatre and from 
                         the stage points Oswald out...

               The cops advance on Oswald, who jumps up, as if expecting to 
               be shot.

                         Kill the President, will you?

               Scared, Oswald takes a swing at a policeman.  He pulls out 
               his gun.  The officers close in on him from the rear and 
               front.  A wrestling and shoving match ensues.  One officer 
               gets a chokehold on Oswald and another one hits him.

                         The cops have their man!  It was 
                         already been decided - in Washington.

               Outside the theatre, Oswald, his eye blackened, is led out 
               by the phalanx of officers.  They are surrounded by an angry 
               crowd.

                         Dr. Best, Himmler's right hand man 
                         in the Gestapo, once said "as long 
                         as the police carries out the will 
                         of the leadership, it is acting 
                         legally."  That mindset allowed for 
                         400 political murders in the Weimar 
                         Republic of 1923 - 32, where the 
                         courts were controlled and the guilty 
                         acquitted.  Oswald must've felt like 
                         Josef K in Kafka's "The Trial".  He 
                         was never told the reason of his 
                         arrest, he does not know the unseen 
                         forces ranging against him, he cries 
                         out his outrage in the police lineup 
                         just like Josef K excoriates the 
                         judge for not being told the charges 
                         against him.  But the state is deaf.  
                         The quarry is caught.  By the time 
                         he is brought from the theatre, a 
                         large crowd is waiting to scream at 
                         him.  By the time he reaches police 
                         headquarters, he is booked for 
                         murdering Tippit...

               At the Dallas police station, Dallas Police Captain Will 
               Fritz takes a call from a high official in Washington.  In 
               the background we notice Lee Oswald continuing to be 
               questioned by federal agents.  We hear Johnson's distinctive 
               Texas drawl but we never see him.

                         care of us down in Dallas.  Lady

                         Thank you, Mr. President.  We're 
                         doing our best.

                         hound dog down there to get this 
                         mess wrapped up, but I gotta tell 
                         you there's too much confusion coming 
                         out of Dallas now.  The TVs and the 
                         papers are full of rumour 'bout 
                         conspiracies.  Two gunmen, two rifles, 
                         the Russkies done it, the Cubans 
                         done it, that kinda loose talk, it's 
                         carin' the shit outta people, bubba'.  
                         This thing could lead us into a war 
                         that could cost 40 million lives.  
                         We got to show'em we got this thing 
                         under control.  No question, no 
                         doubts, for the good of our country... 
                         you hear me?

                                     FRITZ
                         Yes, sir.

                         Cap'n, you got your man, the 
                         investigation's over, that's what 
                         people want to hear.

               The camera closes in on Oswald in the background.  He turns 
               to an unseen Deputy, sad.

                         By the time the sun rose the next 
                         morning, he is booked for murdering 
                         the President.  The whole country - 
                         fueled by the media - assumes he's 
                         guilty.

               In an underground police garage, we see Jack Ruby being 
               allowed in via an interior staircase by his police contact.  
               He moves towards the outer edge of reporters, nervous.

               Oswald comes out with his two guards.  We see a repeat of 
               the assassination in stop time... Ruby's eyes, Oswald's... 
               do they recognize each other?

                         Under the guise of a patriotic 
                         nightclub owner out to spare Jackie 
                         Kennedy from having to testify at a 
                         trial, Jack Ruby is shown into the 
                         underground garage by one of his 
                         inside men on the Dallas Police Force, 
                         and when he's ready Oswald is brought 
                         out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely 
                         disposed of as an enemy of the people.  
                         By early Sunday afternoon, the autopsy 
                         has been completed on him.  Who 
                         grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald?  Buried 
                         in a cheap grave under the name 
                         "Oswald"?  No one.

               We see Oswald dying on the floor of the police station.  A 
               paramedic pushes in and starts administering artificial 
               respiration, which only aggravates the internal hemorrhaging.

               At a Texas cemetery, Oswald's mother weeps.  Oswald is buried 
               with a few people present, but there are no details, no dates.  
               We see Marina whisked out by agents.

               CUT TO Kennedy's funeral, which, in contrast, attracts 
               thousands of mourners.

                         the globe.

                         The Official Legend is created and 
                         the media takes it from there.  The 
                         glitter of official lies and the 
                         epic splendor of the thought-numbing 
                         funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye 
                         and confound the understanding.  
                         Hitler always said "the bigger the 
                         lie, the more people will believe 
                         it."  Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely 
                         man who wanted attention and got it 
                         by killing a President, was only the 
                         first in a long line of patsies.  In 
                         later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin 
                         Luther King, men whose commitment to 
                         change and to peace would make them 
                         dangerous to men who are committed 
                         to war, would follow, also killed by 
                         such "lonely, crazed men," who remove 
                         our guilt by making murder a 
                         meaningless act of a loner.  We have 
                         all become Hamlets in our country - 
                         children of a slain father - leader 
                         whose killers still possess the 
                         throne.  The ghost of John F. Kennedy 
                         confronts us with the secret murder 
                         at the heart of the American dream.  
                         He forces on us the appalling 
                         questions:  Of what is our 
                         Constitution made?  What is our 
                         citizenship, and more, our lives 
                         worth?  What is the future of a 
                         democracy where a President can be 
                         assassinated under conspicuously 
                         suspicious circumstances while the 
                         machinery of legal action scarcely 
                         trembles?  How many political murders, 
                         disguised as heart attacks, cancer, 
                         suicides, airplane and car crashes, 
                         drug overdoses will occur before 
                         they are exposed for what they are?

               Liz watches, moved.  Susie, Al and Numa are also there for 
               the summation.  Even Lou Ivon has come back to support his

                         "Treason doth never prosper," wrote 
                         an English poet, "What's the reason?  
                         For if it prosper, none dare call it 
                         treason."  The generals who sent 
                         Dreyfus to Devils Island were among 
                         the most honorable men in France, 
                         the men who killed Caesar were among 
                         the most honorable men in Rome.  And 
                         the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt, 
                         were honorable men.  I believe we 
                         have reached a time in our country, 
                         similar to what life must've been 
                         like under Hitler in the 30's, except 
                         we don't realize it because Fascism 
                         in our country takes the benign 
                         disguise of liberal democracy.  There 
                         won't be such familiar signs as 
                         swastikas.  We won't build Dachaus 
                         and Auschwitzes.  We're not going to 
                         wake up one morning and suddenly 
                         find ourselves in gray uniforms goose -

                         will come," Huey Long once said. "in 
                         the name of anti-fascism" - it will 
                         come in the name of your security - 
                         they call it "National Security," it 
                         will come with the mass media 
                         manipulating a clever concentration 
                         camp of the mind.  The super state 
                         will provide you tranquility above 
                         the truth, the super state will make 
                         you believe you are living in the 
                         best of all possible worlds, and in 
                         order to do so will rewrite history 
                         as it sees fit.  George Orwell's

                         future."

                         fundamental power from the hands of 
                         the American people and validates 
                         the ascendancy of invisible government 
                         in the United States?  That kind of 
                         "national security," gentlemen of 
                         the jury, is when it smells like it, 
                         feels like it, and looks like it,

                         I submit to you that what took place 
                         on November 22, 1963 was a coup 
                         d'etat.  Its most direct and tragic 
                         result was a reversal of President 
                         Kennedy's commitment to withdraw 
                         from Vietnam.  War is the biggest 
                         business in America worth $80 billion 
                         a year.  The President was murdered 
                         by a conspiracy planned in advance 
                         at the highest levels of the United 
                         States government and carried out by

                         Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's

                         was a public execution and it was

                         individuals in the Dallas Police 
                         Department, the Secret Service, the 
                         FBI, and the White House - all the 
                         way up to and including J. Edgar 
                         Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I 
                         consider accomplices after the fact.

                              (laughter)
                         Let's ask the two men who have 
                         profited the most from the 
                         assassination - your former President 
                         Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new 
                         President, Richard Nixon - to release 
                         51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee 
                         Oswald and Jack Ruby, or the secret 
                         CIA memo on Oswald's activities in 
                         Russia that was "destroyed" while 
                         being photocopied.  All these 
                         documents are yours - the people's 
                         property - you pay for it, but because 
                         the government considers you children 
                         who might be too disturbed to face 
                         this reality, because you might lynch 
                         those involved, you cannot see these 
                         documents for another 75 years.  I'm 
                         in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled 
                         off this mortal coil by then, but 
                         I'm already telling my 8 year - old 
                         son to keep himself physically fit 
                         so that one glorious September morning 
                         in 2038 he can walk into the National 
                         Archives and find out what the CIA 
                         and the FBI knew.  They may even 
                         push it back then.  It may become a 
                         generational affair, with questions 
                         passed down from father to son, mother 
                         to daughter, in the manner of the 
                         ancient runic bards.  Someday 
                         somewhere, someone might find out 
                         the damned Truth.  Or we might just 
                         build ourselves a new Government 
                         like the Declaration of Independence 
                         says we should do when the old one 
                         ain't working - maybe a little farther 
                         out West.

                         An American naturalist wrote, "a 
                         patriot must always be ready to defend 
                         his country against its government."  
                         Well, I'd hate to be in your shoes 
                         today.  You have a lot to think about.  
                         Going back to when we were children, 
                         I think most of us in this courtroom 
                         thought that justice came into being 
                         automatically, that virtue was its 
                         own reward, that good would triumph 
                         over evil.  But as we get older we 
                         know that this just isn't true.  
                         "The frontier is where a man faces a 
                         fact."  Individual human beings have 
                         to create justice and this is not 
                         easy because truth often presents a 
                         threat to power and we have to fight 
                         power often at great risk to 
                         ourselves.  People like Julia Ann 
                         Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers, 
                         Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have 
                         come forward and taken that risk.
                              (he produces a stack 
                              of letters)
                         I have here some $8000 in these 
                         letters sent to my office from all 
                         over the country - quarters, dimes, 
                         dollar bills from housewives, 
                         plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, 
                         invalids ... These are the people 
                         who cannot afford to send money but 
                         do, these are the ones who drive the 
                         cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, 
                         who see their kids go to Vietnam.  
                         Why?  Because they care, because 
                         they want to know the truth - because 
                         they want their country back, because 
                         it belongs to us the people as long 
                         as the people got the guts to fight 
                         for what they believe in!  The truth 
                         is the most important value we have 
                         because if the truth does not endure, 
                         if the Government murders truth, if 
                         you cannot respect the hearts of 
                         these people...
                              (shaking the letters)
                         ...then this is no longer the country 
                         in which we were born in and this is 
                         not the country I want to die in...  
                         And this was never more true than 
                         for John F. Kennedy whose murder was 
                         probably the most terrible moment in 
                         the history of our country.  You the 
                         people, you the jury system, in 
                         sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw, 
                         represent the hope of humanity against 
                         Government power.  In discharging 
                         your duty, in bringing the first 
                         conviction in this house of cards 
                         against Clay Shaw, "Ask not what 
                         your country can do for you, but 
                         what you can do for your country."  
                         Do not forget your young President 
                         who forfeited his life.  Show the 
                         world this is still a government of 
                         the people, for the people, and by 
                         the people.  Nothing as long as you 
                         live will ever be more important.
                              (he stares into the 
                              camera)
                         It's up to you.

               He returns to the table and sits.  The courtroom is still.

               CUT TO: later in the same courtroom.  The jury files in, 
               having reached a verdict.  Jim, prepared, sits with his staff 
               and Liz.  The jury foreman enters the courtroom.

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         We find Clay Shaw... not guilty on 
                         all counts.

               There's jubilation and commotion in the Court.  Shaw stands, 
               happily shaking hands all over... Members of the press run 
               for the phones.  In the corridor outside the courtroom, the 
               press interviews the jury foreman.

                                     FOREMAN
                         We believe there was a conspiracy, 
                         but whether Clay Shaw was a part of 
                         it is another kettle of fish.

               The camera moves to Jim, who walks out past the banks of 
               reporters.  TV lights are in his face.  Liz is by his side.

                         Mr. Garrison, the American media is

                         of the Warren Commission, do you...

                                     JIM
                         I think all it proves is you cannot 
                         run a trial even questioning the 
                         intelligence operations of the 
                         government in the light of day.

                         resignation - unfit to hold office.  
                         You've ruined Clay Shaw's reputation - 
                         are you going to resign?

                                     JIM
                         Hell, no.  I'm gonna run again.  And 
                         I'm gonna win.  Thank you very much.  
                         If it takes me 30 years to nail every 
                         one of the assassins, then I will 
                         continue this investigation for 30 
                         years.  I owe that not only to Jack 
                         Kennedy, but to my country.

               He and Liz squeeze hands as they walk on.

               DISSOLVE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. - (1970)

               Jim waits on the same park bench as earlier in the film, 
               overlooking the Mall or the Lincoln Monument... as X walks 
               up, a little grayer, a little more stooped, wearing ill 
               fitting civilian clothes.

                                     JIM
                         Well, thanks for coming.

                         You didn't get that break you needed, 
                         but you went as far as any man could, 
                         bubba.
                              (he sits next to Jim)
                         What can I do for you?

                                     JIM
                         Just speculating, I guess.  How do 
                         you think it started?

                                     X
                         I think it started in the wind.  
                         Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon 
                         people, contractors, bankers, 
                         politicians like L.B.J. were committed 
                         to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early 
                         as '61 they knew Kennedy was going 
                         to change things... He was not going 
                         to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows?  
                         Probably some boardroom or lunchroom 
                         somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, 
                         maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, 
                         it's international now.

               CUT TO: a New York lunch club or executive dining room.  
               From the window we have a towering view of the City.  Four 
               men in their 50's to 70's - old men, rich men, talk at a 
               quiet table.  Their figures are shadowy and we overhear their 
               conversation obliquely, across faces flared out by sun 
               bouncing off the skyscraper window.

                         with a few million dollars... and 
                         says something pretty direct like...

                         The sonofabitch is gonna get re-
                         elected by a bigger vote than ever 
                         in '64.  It's gonna be worse than 
                         Roosevelt.  The country won't survive 
                         as we know it.

                         I agree, Bob, it can't go on.
                              (he looks to Man 3)

                                     RICH MAN 3
                         ...and Bobby in '68?  Something's 
                         got to be done.

               Looks pass among them.  There's a pause, and then...

                                     RICH MAN 1
                         He's gotta go, Lou.  The election's 
                         gotta be stopped.

               There is a breathless moment with the thought in the air.

                                     RICH MAN 1
                         I talk to a lot of people.  I know

                         They start talking about it.  A few 
                         people here, there.  Just 
                         conversations, nothing more...

               We see a general meeting with another general.  They talk.

                         Generals, Admirals, CIA people, and 
                         probably some people on the inside 
                         of Kennedy's staff - young, brilliant 
                         Judases, ready to go to war in 
                         Southeast Asia...

               FLASHBACK TO: the White House, 1962.  A general talks to one 
               of Kennedy's staff - a bespectacled, bright young Harvard 
               type.

                         Kennedy, like Caesar, is surrounded

               ON A BLACK SCREEN WE READ:

               ** In 1975, VICTOR MARCHETTI, former executive assistant to 
               the CIA's deputy director, stated that during high - level 
               CIA meetings during Shaw's trial in 1969, CIA director RICHARD 
               HELMS disclosed that CLAY SHAW and DAVID FERRIE had worked 
               for the Agency, and asked his assistants to make sure Mr. 
               Shaw received Agency help at his trial.

               ** In 1979, RICHARD HELMS, director of covert operations in 
               1963, admitted under oath that CLAY SHAW had Agency 
               connections.

               ** It is now known that in 1963, U.S. military intelligence 
               controlled more agents than the CIA and had almost as much 
               money to spend.  It surfaced in the 1970's that the Army had 
               long been conducting surveillance and keeping files on 
               thousands of private citizens in the name of national 
               security.  The prime targets were dissident-left-wingers of 
               the kind Oswald appeared to be.

               ** CLAY SHAW died in 1974 of supposed lung cancer.  No autopsy 
               was allowed.

               ** WILLIAM SULLIVAN, Assistant Director of the FBI, died in 
               the early morning hours of November 9,177 when he was mistaken 
               for a deer in an open field in New Hampshire.  Shortly before 
               his death, Sullivan had a preliminary hearing with the HSCA.

               ** GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT committed suicide just hours after 
               HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi located him.

               ** In November, 1969 JIM GARRISON was re-elected to a third 
               term as District Attorney of Orleans Parish.  In June of 
               1971, he was arrested by Federal Agents on charges of allowing 
               payoffs on pinball gambling by organized crime.  In September 
               of 1973, after defending himself in Federal Court, he was 
               quickly found not guilty of charges that appear to have been 
               framed against him.  Less than six weeks later, he was 
               narrowly defeated for a fourth term as District Attorney.

               ** In 1978, Garrison was elected Judge of the Louisiana State 
               Court of Appeal in New Orleans.  He was re - elected in 1988.  
               To this date, he has brought the only public prosecution in 
               the Kennedy killing.

               ** ELIZABETH and Jim were divorced in 1978.  He now lives in 
               the same house he lived in with Elizabeth.  She lives a block 
               away.  Their five children are grown.

               ** SOUTHEAST ASIA: 58,000 American lives, 2 million Asian 
               lives, $220 billion spent, 10 million Americans air - lifted 
               there by commercial aircraft, more than 5,000 helicopters 
               lost, 6.5 million tons of bombs dropped.

               ** A Congressional Investigation from 1976 - 1979 found a 
               "probable conspiracy" in the assassination of John F. Kennedy 
               and recommended the Justice Department investigate further.  
               As of 1991, the Justice Department has done nothing.  The 
               files of the House Select Committee on Assassinations are 
               locked away until the year 2029.

               The camera moves onto the mottoes chiselled in the walls of 
               the National Archives in Washington, D.C.:

 ON BLACK: If I didn't have enough money, I'd be dead right now. - Carroll Shelby FADE IN: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY Mancini's "Ave Maria" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road. CREDITS ROLL A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist. EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard. EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end. SLO-MO The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy. EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes. Dairy Queens, Hardee's, and Walmarts line the main drag. Stars and Stripes flutter from lampposts. INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING A man sits propped up against pillows, his sleeping wife snuggled next to him. His name is JOHN QUINCY ARCHIBALD. His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing. JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs. WIFE Honey, what is it? EXT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - MORNING The screen door bangs open. John Q. bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house. TWO TRUCKERS are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old Chevy. J.Q. Hey, what the hell are you doing? TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1 What does it look like? J.Q. Aw, come on. That's my car. TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1 Yeah? That's not what the bank says. The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in. John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement. The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper. Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes. MIKE What's going on? INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING CLOSE ON a hand circling want-ads in red ink. J.Q. sits at the kitchen table drinking a half-filled cup of coffee, his eyes scouring the classifides. Denise enters, dressed in her brown and red supermarket cashier's uniform. Without speaking, she passes J.Q. and starts making breakfast. J.Q. Sorry. Denise doesn't respond. A chill fills the air. J.Q. (CONT'D) I talked to the bank. They promised they'd work with me. DENISE Okay. J.Q. I did. DENISE John, that was two months ago. J.Q. We've got enough money for next month's rent. That's it. It was either the car or the house, so I thought... DENISE You thought. J.Q. What did you want me to do? Have us put out on the street? I'm down to twenty hours a week a the plant. They shipped off half the damn jobs down to Mexico. DENISE My car is gone, John. J.Q. You know I'm out there trying to find a second job. DENISE What do you want me to say? That it's fine? Alright, it's fine. J.Q. The car's still ours, Denise. We own it. All we have to do is wait two weeks until my check comes in. Mike enters dressed for school. He strikes a body builder's pose, flexing. MIKE Yah! Ronnie Coleman, Mr. Olympics two years running. Yah! He moves to the bread box and grabs a donut. DENISE Sit down, honey. Eat some breakfast. MIKE (mouthful of food) I am eating. J.Q. A donut isn't breakfast. MIKE Yeah it is. It's a continental breakfast. J.Q. Yeah, well, you're not a continent right now. MIKE Uh, Dad, what do you call North America? Denise sets down two plates of hot food. DENISE Enough about that. You're not going to school without breakfast. Now eat. Both of you. Mike and John Q. wolf down their food three bites at a time. MIKE I can't believe those jerks took our car, can you, Mom? Denise gives J.Q. the hairy eyeball. DENISE No, I can't. MIKE What are we going to do? You're not going to do something, right, Dad? You know what I'd do? I'd get so big and mad, I'd just go crazy and kick someone's butt. J.Q. Watch your language. MIKE I would. I swear. When I grow up I'll be so strong no one will ever take nothing from us. J.Q. You've been watching too much of that W.W. wrestling. MIKE Not wrestling, Dad. Body building. There's a big difference. DENISE Alright, alright. Get your books. You're going to be late. Mike runs out of the room. Denise starts to clear the table. DENISE (CONT'D) Give me a ride to work? J.Q. Sure. J.Q. takes her arm. J.Q. (CONT'D) Baby, things will get better. I promise. I've just got to get a few paychecks ahead, that's all. INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT An amber light flashes through the darkness, followed by a rapid buzzing sound. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on a mammoth-sized printer, furiously pounding letters onto a fact sheet. We catch glimpses of peoples' names, hometowns, other vital information. Vernell Tilson, Des Moines. Arthur Friedlander, Jefferson City. Amy Podgorsky, Topeka. INT. JOHN Q.'S TRUCK - DAY John, Denise and Mike. Denise in the middle. John and Mike are playing Speedy Gonzalez. The object of the game is to pick something and then say it so fast it's almost indecipherable. Mike's got a good one. MIKE Rdshxshn. J.Q. Reddish Stick? MIKE No. Rdshxshn. J.Q. Radishes? MIKE Rdshxshn. J.Q. I swear to God, I'm hearing reddish stick. MIKE It's a radio station. J.Q. Oh, brother. You got me. It's Dad's turn. J.Q. (CONT'D) Ydugskew. MIKE Yogurt and stew? J.Q. Yogurt and Stew? MIKE Well, I don't know. Do it again. J.Q. Ydugskew. MIKE I give up. J.Q. You're going to school. MIKE Dad! J.Q. Okay. One more. It's the longest one in history. J.Q. (CONT'D) Iplglgnstheflgvthntdstscvmrcndthrpblcfw chtstndsnntnndrgdndvsblewithlbrtyndjstc rll. Mike gives him a look. J.Q. (CONT'D) Pledge of allegiance. MIKE Wow. That's a good one. How about you, Mom? DENISE I don't want to play. You guys always make fun of me. MIKE Come on, Mom. It's fun. J.Q. Yeah, Mom. DENISE Okay. Mom's not very good. You can always understand her clearly. DENISE (CONT'D) Dashboard. The boys giggle. DENISE (CONT'D) What? No good? Okay. Okay. Hold on. She tries to be tricky, but still it's clear as a bell. DENISE (CONT'D) Antenna. The boys laugh at her. DENISE (CONT'D) See. That's why I don't play. The car stops in front of the small, red brick elementary school. Kids everywhere. Mike kisses his mother goodbye. EXT. THOMAS EDISON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY John walks Mike to the gate. Mike turns, serious. MIKE Hey, Dad? I've got forty-six dollars I saved from my allowance. You can have it if you want. J.Q. Yeah? MIKE We're a family. We've got to stick together, right? John rubs his son's head. He's a good boy. J.Q. Right. But you earned that money. You keep it. Mike runs toward the schoolhouse. MIKE Okay. See you later! J.Q. Goodbye. Mike turns around. MIKE No, Dad. See you later. I hate goodbye. J.Q. Okay, okay. See you later. Mike does the crab before running inside. MIKE Flex Wheeler, 275 pounds. Two percent body fat. Yah! INT. NEIMAN MACHINERY PLANT - DAY Sparks. Fire. Goggles. Tires as tall as two-story buildings. John Q. and his best friend, JIMMY PALUMBO, work the assembly line. John holds a giant riveter. INT. NEIMAN MACHINERY PLANT - EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - DAY Quitting time. Employees are showering, towling down, changing. John Q. is putting on a tie. JIMMY What's the deal with the jacket? Who died? EXT. NEIMAN MACHINERY PLANT - DAY Cement and huge. Smoke billows from the stacks. John Q. and Jimmy make their way to their trucks. J.Q. I've got a job interview at the machinery plant over in Otisville. JIMMY What job? There are no jobs. J.Q. I saw it in the paper. JIMMY Forget it. J.Q. I've got to go. Denise is going to kill me if I don't find something. They repo'd her car this morning. JIMMY Oh, boy. You want me to go with you? INT. OTISVILLE MACHINERY PLANT - WAITING AREA - DAY The waiting room is packed. A lot of people needing work. John fills out the application. JIMMY This is a waste of time. Four hundred people for one job. Give me a break. John keeps filling out his paperwork. JIMMY (CONT'D) I'm telling you, somebody's son, cousin, uncle has already got this job sewn up. J.Q. Jimmy, why do they put it in the paper if they're not hiring? JIMMY They've got to put it in the paper to make it look good. State law or something. J.Q. Give it a rest, will you? JIMMY I'm just saying, it's the run around. Mark my words. It's either, 'We'll keep your application on file.' That's the kiss of death. Or they tell you that you're overqualified. Either way, you're screwed. A PERSONNEL MANAGER emerges from his office and reads from a clipboard. PERSONNEL MANAGER John Archibald? INT. OTISVILLE MACHINERY PLANT - PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY John Q. sits across the desk from the P.M. J.Q. I've been working heavy machinery for fifteen years. I really want this job. Whatever you need, I can do. PERSONNEL MANAGER I see. J.Q. Hey, I could start today. John Q. laughs nervously as the P.M. reviews his application. PERSONNEL MANAGER Your resume is very impressive. You've certainly got the experience. Frankly, you might be overqualified. John Q. gets the message. He pushes his chair back and starts to get up. INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT The daisy wheel buzzsaws across the page. WE SEE more names, columns, entitled STATUS, ENTRY DATE. Underneath the Entry Date heading, months and days appear: June 19, April 30. February 6. INT. ALL SAINTS CHURCH - DAY Sunday services. The congregation sings. In the third row, Mike elbows his Dad. MIKE The game starts in fifteen minutes. We're gonna be late. J.Q. I know. A few rows back, John sees Jimmy Palumbo tapping his watch. Denise gives her husband a disapproving look. John sticks his head back in the hymn book and continues singing. EXT. ALL SAINTS CHURCH - DAY The congregation pours out of the church and parishioners run to their cars. Denise stops to talk to the PASTOR. MIKE Dad! John moves over to Denise and the Pastor. J.Q. Sorry, Reverend. No time for saving souls today. Big game. PASTOR Have you been saying your prayers like we talked about? J.Q. Does praying for a job count? PASTOR Work on him, will you, Denise? DENISE He's hopeless. PASTOR No one's hopeless. Good luck! The Pastor waves as John grabs Denise by the hand and they run to the truck and hop in. In the parking lot, kids put on their uniforms, men and women change out of their Sunday best. Cars, vans, pick-ups, "dualies" take off, tires spinning, everybody whooping and hollering. EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY It's a tailgate party. Parents lugging ice chests, making sandwiches, barbecuing. In the bleachers, John, Denise, Jimmy Palumbo, and his wife, GINA, cheer on the home team. The wives are really loud. DENISE Let's go, Orioles! GINA Pitcher's got a rubber arm! The Dodger pitcher stretches, fires a fastball. The batter takes the pitch. UMPIRE Ball four! Tommy trots down to first base. JIMMY Way to go, Tommy. Good eye. Walk's as good as a hit. Mike steps to the plate. Family and friends cheer wildly. GINA Yeah, Mike! Drive him home, baby! You can do it! DENISE Hey, pitcher! Hey, pitcher! The pitcher smokes one down the middle. Mike swings. Nothing but air. J.Q. That's okay, Mikey. Put the bat on the ball. The pitcher burns one on the outside corner. UMPIRE Strike two! DENISE Hey, ump, you're blind! I hate this pitcher. How old is he, anyway? GINA He's supposed to be twelve. JIMMY Twelve, my ass. Look at him. His beard just grew an inch between pitches! J.Q. Don't let him rattle you, Mikey. Wait for your pitch. The catcher flashes fingers. The pitcher nods and fires. Mike hits a sharp ground ball between first and second. The second baseman moves over but doesn't have the angle. The first baseman charges the ball, scoops it on the run, then underhands it to the Dodger pitcher, who gallops off the mound towards first. Mike's foot hits the bag at exactly the same time the ball plops in the pitcher's outstretched glove. FIRST BASE UMP SAAAAAAAAFFFEEE! DODGER PITCHER No way! He was out! FIRST BASE UMP Tie goes to the runner, son. As the Dodger pitcher argues with the umpire, the Oriole player on third base darts towards home. The Dodger pitcher wheels around and fires. Too late, the runner scores. HOME PLATE UMP Saaaaaffee! Seeing an opening, Mike races from first to second, arms pumping, breathing hard. The Dodger shortstop sees Mike, races to the base and calls for the throw. DODGER SHORTSTOP Second base! The Dodger catcher throws off his mask and fires the ball. CLOSE ON MIKE, slowing, suddenly clutching his chest, gulping for air, ten feet from the base. SMACK. The ball lands in the shortstop's glove. Mike wobbles, doubles over and falls face first into the dirt. The Dodger shortstop stands over Mike. He can't decide if he should tag him. Players, spectators look on dazed, shocked. ANGLE - BLEACHERS PUSH IN ON J.Q.'s FACE, panicked. TRACK HIM leaping down the bleachers, knocking over spectators, racing onto the playing field. J.Q. Mike! Jesus God. He lifts Mike's head, holds it in his hands. Denise arrives, hysterical. DENISE Mike?! Mikey, can you hear me? Mike is semi-conscious, eyes dilated, barely breathing. JIMMY Somebody call an ambulance. J.Q. I'm not waiting for an ambulance. J.Q. lifts Mike into his arms and races with Denise through the crowd towards the parking lot. Denise gets in the pick up and John lays Mike down in her lap before gunning the engine and taking off. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY J.Q.'s pick up speeds along a super highway, blurring past rural pastures, farmland and cornfields. Up ahead, the oppressive skyscrapers of the city. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY A monolithic maze of glass and stone. John's truck screeches to a stop at the E.R. entrance. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY It's standing room only. Bodies everywhere. Doctors and nurses move purposefully through the suffering masses. Mike in his arms, J.Q. and Denise run double-time through the crowded corridors. J.Q. Help! My son can't breathe! I need help here! Can somebody please... A male nurse, LEO MAGUIRE, leaves what he's doing and moves towards them. He clutches Mike's wrist, taking his pulse. MAGUIRE What happened? J.Q. I don't know. He had a baseball game. All of a sudden he... Maguire passes a female nurse in the hallway. MAGUIRE I need a doctor right away. Room 6. INT. RESUSCITATION ROOM - DAY Maguire helps J.Q. lower Mike onto an examination table, and immediately several emergency technicians start applying the resuscitation equipment. Their movements are swift and precise. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around Mike's arm, an oxymeter to the tip of his finger, and sensors are stuck all over his chest. The E.R. doctor is MARJORIE KLEIN, early 30's. Klein is all business, assessing Mike's condition. MAGUIRE Pulse is 150. B.P. 68 over 34. Collapsed playing baseball. J.Q. notices Maguire glancing worriedly at Klein. J.Q. He was running. Next thing we know he keels over. DR. KLEIN Anything like this ever happen before? J.Q. Never. No, ma'am. Never. MAGUIRE Pulse is seventy-eight percent. DR. KLEIN Let's get him on some oxygen. Maguire reaches for the Oxygen tank, lays the mask over Mike's nose, turns the screw. As Mike inhales the hissing air, Klein turns Mike on his side, probes his lung and lower back areas. J.Q. He's going to be alright, isn't he? DR. KLEIN The lungs are wet and his liver feels enlarged. Five mil I.V. Digoxin, stat. Maguire moves to the counter, finds an I.V. needle, fills it with Digoxin. DENISE What's the matter with him? Just then, another R.N. charges in. Klein "eyes" the nurse who immediately picks up on the look. R.N. Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, would you come with me? J.Q. What? R.N. He's in good hands. Please, there's a few procedures we need to go over. J.Q. What kind of procedures? The R.N. gently takes J.Q.'s elbow. J.Q. pushes her hand away. R.N. We're going to be admitting your son, sir. You'll need to fill out the proper forms. DENISE For godsakes, can't the forms wait? John and Denise watch helplessly as Maguire stabs an I.V. needle into Mike's vein. R.N. Please, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. It's possible your son may need a transfusion. We'll need to test you both for blood types. The R.N. edges them out as SWOOSH, the divider curtain is pulled shut. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY J.Q. and Denise are escorted by the R.N. to the admitting desk. Arms bent, fists clenched, they're pressing sterilized gauze pads to their inner elbow joints. ADMITTING NURSE First name, Mr. Archibald? J.Q. John. The admitting nurse's fingers glide over the computer keyboard, inputting all vital info. ADMITTING NURSE Middle initial? J.Q. Q. Quincy. ADMITTING NURSE And the name of your insurance company? JIMMY (O.S.) John! J.Q. spins and sees Jimmy and Gina rushing through the E.R. doors. GINA Where is he, is he okay? J.Q. I don't know. They're running tests. We're waiting to find out. GINA What can we do? Gina throws her arms around Denise, consoling her. ADMITTING NURSE Your card, Mr. Archibald? J.Q. Huh? ADMITTING NURSE Your insurance card. I'll need to make a copy for our files. J.Q. pulls out his wallet, fumbles for his card, hands it to the admitting nurse. INT. PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - DAY J.Q. and Denise walk past rows of quiet, glassed-in rooms full of patients and life-support machines. They enter Mike's room to find REGGIE, a twenty-four year old nurse, hooking Mike up to the high monitor above the bed. Mike is lying supine, awake but groggy, hooked up to a heart monitor, IV drips, hideous plastic tubes up his nose, down his throat, on full inotropic support. Denise leans over, kisses Mike. DENISE Hi, sweetheart. J.Q. Hey, slugger, how are you doing? Mike smiles weakly, struggles to speak, points to the tubes. MIKE I can't...talk. J.Q. Relax, buddy. Get some rest. Mike closes his eyes. He's really out of it. J.Q. (CONT'D) I love you, kid. Denise reacts to all the flashing numbers on the monitors. DENISE What's all this? REGGIE This is so we can monitor Mike's vitals. Respiratory rate. Pulse oximetry. Heart rate. And this one is blood pressure. Diastolic and systolic. Reggie points to a bank of monitors. In the middle is a flashing number 88. REGGIE (CONT'D) We'd like this top number to stay above ninety, but between eighty-five and ninety is acceptable for now. Anything less than eighty is dangerous. If his blood pressure drops, we're going to have to do something. We can't have him going below seventy again. DENISE What would that mean? REGGIE Seventy and below, he's in heart failure. Reggie exits. J.Q. and Denise watch the blood pressure monitor, holding steady at 88. Plink. Suddenly, the number drops a notch to 87. INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT Growing. Names multiplaying. Jones, Baker, Azbirjari, Hererra. The daisy wheel pounds incessantly. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CARDIO-THORACIC DEPT. - DAY Eight members Hope Memorial Hospital's administrative staff are seated at a long conference table. Among them are DR. RAYMOND TURNER, mid-40's, REBECCA PAYNE, Hope Memorial Hospital's Administrative Supervisor, and Dr. Marjorie Klein. PAYNE The father works part-time. Mother's a cashier in a supermarket. DR. KLEIN how's the family's insurance? She shakes her head - "we've got a problem." Payne sees J.Q. and Denise enter and she is immediately on her feet. PAYNE Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Rebecca Payne, hospital director. This is Doctor Turner, head of our cardiology department. J.Q. How's our boy doing? PAYNE Please sit down. John and Denise sit, and the lights are dimmed. Dr. Turner approaches an illuminated display of X-rays. He uses a pointer to clarify. DR. TURNER This X-ray is that of a normal, nine year old heart. This one is your son's. John Q. and Denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist-sized organs on the translucent glass. DR. TURNER (CONT'D) There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy. As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size. He points to Mike's heart, huge in comparison. J.Q. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Could you pout that in layman's terms? DR. TURNER Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard. J.Q. So what's he need? An operation? Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses. DR. TURNER I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant. The room goes silent. DENISE He's nine. PAYNE Wait a second. There are other options. J.Q. What options? PAYNE To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now. DENISE I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine. DR. TURNER He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up. PAYNE I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye. DENISE Oh my God. PAYNE And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance. J.Q. What do you think, Dr. Turner? DR. TURNER This isn't my decision. J.Q. I know that. I'm asking for your opinion. Without surgery, how long does he have? DR. TURNER Not long. Months. Weeks. Days. This is too much for Denise. She breaks into tears. John puts his arms around her, steadies her, gathers his thoughts. J.Q. What would you do if it was your son? PAYNE Mr. Archibald... J.Q. Not you. Him. DR. TURNER I'd do the transplant. Absolutely. J.Q. looks at Denise, who nods. J.Q. Okay. Let's do it. DR. TURNER The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away. PAYNE It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so. J.Q. I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered. PAYNE Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude. J.Q. There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered. PAYNE What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage? DENISE No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits. Payne flips through the Archibald family file. PAYNE I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings. J.Q. Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured. PAYNE That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account. DENISE How much does a transplant cost? PAYNE Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum. J.Q. What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son? PAYNE We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list. DENISE What kind of down payment? PAYNE Thirty percent. Seventy-five thousand. J.Q. Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kid's name on a list? DENISE Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money? PAYNE Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list. INT. HALLWAY - CARDIO-THORACIC DEPT. - DAY J.Q. and Denise move down the hallway towards the elevators. DR. KLEIN (O.S.) Mr. and Mrs. Archibald? They turn. J.Q. You don't want to treat my kid? Fine. I'll take him over to County Memorial. DR. KLEIN Trust me. You don't want to do that. J.Q. I don't, huh? Watch me. It's a county hospital. They have to treat him. DR. KLEIN No they don't. Transplantation is always considered an elective procedure. This hospital's politics are particularly infuriating, but you're in the right place. Believe me. You want Dr. Turner. His bedside manner is terrible, but he's one of the foremost surgeons in the country. J.Q. What do you want us to do? You heard Payne. We're a cash account. DR. KLEIN I know it's outrageous, but don't give up. Talk to your insurance company. Check with our Human Resources Department for medical assistance, State Children's Services, Medicaid. Just don't take no for an answer. INT. NEIMAN MACHINERY PLANT - EMPLOYEE SERVICE OFFICE - DAY John sits in a cubicle across from his employer's insurance representative. INSURANCE REP. You coverage has changed, Mr. Archibald. J.Q. Changed? INSURANCE REP. We've recently switched carriers from a PPO to an HMO. It's a less expensive policy, but unfortunately it has some restrictions. J.Q. What kind of restrictions? INSURANCE REP. This is how it works. Non-management, part-time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage. J.Q. But I'm not part-time. I'm a full-time employee. It's just slow right now. INSURANCE REP. Sure. But your coverage is based on house worked. Like I said, you only qualify for second tier, and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty-thousand dollars. J.Q. Wait a minute. I've been paying for my coverage for years. You take it out of my paycheck every week. INSURANCE REP. And that's why we're going to cover you for the full twenty. J.Q. Let me get this straight. You drop me from full-time to part-time, switch carriers, and now you're telling me I'm not fully covered even though I have a policy that says I am. INSURANCE REP. Doesn't seem right, does it? J.Q. No, sir. It doesn't. My son is very sick. If I'm not covered, I've got a serious problem. INSURANCE REP. I understand that, but there's nothing I can do. You might want to try State Services. Either that, or you can file an appeal. J.Q. Yeah? The insurance rep pushes a stack of papers towards J.Q. INSURANCE REP. Here are the forms. It'll take about seven working days. INT. STATE SERVICES - DAY J.Q. and Denise at a window counter, talking to a STATE EMPLOYEE, who only knows what's on the computer screen in front of her. STATE REP Says here you already have medical insurance. J.Q. Not enough. DENISE What little we have is already used up. STATE REP I understand that. But then you don't qualify. We only give assistance to patients without coverage. Are you on Welfare? J.Q. No. STATE REP You should be on Welfare. DENISE Welfare? We both have jobs. STATE REP Oh, that's too bad. Sorry, I can't help you. Try MA. INT. COUNTY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE - DAY A county worker flips through J.Q.'s paperwork. COUNTY EMPLOYEE It says here your son's condition is congenital. J.Q. Yeah? COUNTY EMPLOYEE Not congenitive. J.Q. So what? What's the difference? COUNTY EMPLOYEE Big difference. It means it's a pre existing condition, one your son was born with. A birth defect. Obviously, it pre-dates your coverage. Otherwise we could help. J.Q. That's impossible. He's had clean check ups every year. COUNTY EMPLOYEE I don't know what to tell you. It's right here in the report. Have you tried Medicaid? INT. MEDICAID OFFICES - DAY Another state run facility. Another employee. Another excuse. MEDICAID OFFICER No. J.Q. No, what? MEDICAID OFFICER You don't qualify. J.Q. Don't qualify? I've got a kid who's dying and I'm broke. If I don't qualify, who does? MEDICAID OFFICER Lower your voice, sir. J.Q. I mean, what do you guys do, anyway? Why does this service even exist? MEDICAID OFFICER I'm sorry. J.Q. I don't need you to be sorry. I need some help. INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT We see more of the list this time. Boldfaced columns appear: HOSPITAL/CENTER, CROSS MATCH, WEIGHT RANGE, BLOOD TYPE. Vernell Tilson, Des Moines, Metropolitan Hospital, Entry Date: Feb. 5, 215-240 lbs. Type "O". Status 2. Arthur Friedlander, Jefferson City, St. Joseph's Medical Center, Entry Date: April 30, 160-175 lbs. Type "O". Status 2. Mike Archibald... INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - ELEVATOR - DAY John Q. takes the trip down with Rebecca Payne. PAYNE No, no, no. You filed an appeal? An appeal is for an already existing claim. What you needed to file was a grievance. You'll have to resubmit. But that could take up to thirty days. J.Q. I don't have thirty days. PAYNE I know that. J.Q. And, frankly, I'm tired of getting the runaround. I need my son's name on that list. PAYNE Mr. Archibald, your hospital bill is in excess of thirty thousand dollars. So far, we haven't received any kind of payment. We have bent over backward to help you. J.Q. Oh, is that right? PAYNE Yes, sir, that is right. But there is a limit to this hospital's generosity. Once and for all, you are not covered by insurance. We will need to guarantee payment. J.Q. You want money? Alright, I'll get you your money. INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - DAY John selling everything. Television, washer, dryer, sofa. Strangers walk through the house and make offers. Jimmy Palumbo shakes his head. JIMMY You know what you should do? You should try that newsguy that does all those special investigative reports. You know the one. The guy with the hair. J.Q. Yeah, yeah. JIMMY The trouble shooter. Channel eight. What's his name? A woman offers twenty dollars for the coffee table. J.Q. takes it, pocketing the money. JIMMY (CONT'D) Lampley. Tuck Lampley. INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - STUDIO CHANNEL 8 - DAY TUCK LAMPLEY, 38, with plastic hair, sits at his desk, his lunch spread all over the table. LAMPLEY Tuck Lampley. Hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk. I'm up to here today, you know? Go, go, go. J.Q. No, that's fine. Thanks for seeing us. LAMPLEY So, what can I do you for? J.Q. My son, Mike, went into heart failure playing in his little league game. I have full insurance through my work, but now they're saying they don't have to pay. LAMPLEY Why not? JIMMY Lots of reasons. He don't even understand half of them. LAMPLEY What about the hospital? J.Q. Hope Memorial Hospital. LAMPLEY Yeah, Hope Memorial. Don't they have to cover it? JIMMY Right, right? That's what I thought. J.Q. No. The hospital says I have to pay cash. Otherwise the only thing I can do is bring Mike home and watch him die. LAMPLEY Jesus. J.Q. Yeah. Lampley is already working on the story in his head, putting all the pieces in the right place. LAMPLEY Bureaucracy of the medical establishment, American family caught in the middle. JIMMY Right. Big guy versus little guy. We were thinking you could do one of them special interest pieces, you know? Send donations, write your congressman. That kind of thing. J.Q. Anything would help. LAMPLEY What they've done to your son is outrageous, and I want to help. But I've got to run it by my producers. I've got bosses, just like anyone else. So, leave me your phone number, and I'll get back to you. EXT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - DAY The fire sale continues. The Archibald refrigerator is carried out the front door. EXT.

It now reads 86. INT. DINER - DAY John, Jimmy and Gina go door to door, soliciting donations. INT. MIKE'S ICU ROOM - NIGHT J.Q. reads to Mike from a book. Mike's eyes close and John smiles as he falls asleep. As John closes the book, something catches his eye. At the far end of the ICU, a man in a coal black suit stands over a boy in a hospital bed. He is the HOSPITAL CHAPLAIN, and he is performing last rites. The boy's distraught parents hang on to each other for comfort. The chaplain kisses the crucifix, touches it to the boy's forehead, and begins to pray. John and Denise exchange a look.

HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MORNING J.Q. steps off a city bus carrying a gym bag. Windbreaker buttoned, baseball cap pulled down tight, he moves with purpose toward the hospital. INT. EMERGENCY WAITING ROOM - MORNING The broken, battered and bloodied sit on chairs waiting to be seen. A BABY BOY wails in the arms of his Hispanic mother, ROSA. MIRIAM, 28, hugely pregnant, sits next to her husband, STEVE, a contractor, dressed in paint-stained coveralls. LESTER, 23, a blood-soaked towel wrapped around his hand. MITCH, 30's, black jeans, shades, and a huge hangover, sits with his arm around his girlfriend, JULIE, a platinum bombshell. She's hurting. Her face is cut, her eyes swollen. DEBBY UTLEY, a young, sensitive nurse sits behind the admitting desk. MITCH What's going on? Are we going to get seen or what? DEBBY The doctor will be with you shortly, sir. MITCH Shortly? Shortly we could all be dead. We've been waiting damn near an hour. The electric doors slide open and J.Q. enters and looks around before moving quickly through and disappearing into the main hospital entrance. INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - MORNING J.Q. moves through the corridors intently, a man on a mission. Dr. Turner escorts a wheelchair to the hospital exit. In a wheelchair is a middle-aged man, dressed in designer casuals, a Rolex wrapped around his wrist. His name is CARROLL SHELBY, and he is a transplant patient. One of the lucky recipients. His elegantly dressed WIFE walks alongside. DR. TURNER You're doing great, Carroll. You've already gained back five pounds. I think you're the only patient I have who actually eats the food here. SHELBY'S WIFE Thanks for everything, doctor. J.Q. approaches the group. His face reveals nothing. DR. TURNER Hello, John. This is Mr. Archibald. His son's a patient of mine. SHELBY'S WIFE Well, you're certainly in good hands. J.Q. forces a smile. The Shelbys say goodbye before leaving. J.Q. Denise said you're letting Mike go home. DR. TURNER Mr. Archibald, I'm a physician. I don't make policy decisions. That's handled by the board of trustees. J.Q. You're head of Cardiac Surgery, Doctor. You're telling me a person in your position makes a recommendation, no one's going to listen? DR. TURNER I make recommendations all the time. The final decision rests with the board. Not me. J.Q. wags a Hope Memorial brochure at Turner. J.Q. You and your staff did over three hundred operations last year. It's right here on page 4 of the hospital brochure. Nice color pictures, happy faces. Three hundred plus surgeries at a quarter million a pop. That's seventy five million dollars your department took in. Couldn't you do just one on good faith? DR. TURNER Please take your hands off me. J.Q. I'm not asking for charity, Doc. I'll pay. I don't know how, but I swear to God, if it takes me the rest of my life, I will. You have my word as a man. DR. TURNER I'm sorry. I tried to help. But it's out of my hands. Something in J.Q. snaps. Heart pounding, he pushes Turner through a pair of heavy metal doors and into the Emergency Room. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MORNING J.Q. shoves Turner inside, pulls out a Baretta .9mm, points it at Turner's head. J.Q. I'm not asking anymore, Doctor. I'm telling. Now I want a new heart for my kid. You understand? J.Q. drops the gym bag on the floor, unzips it, pulls out a length of heavy chain. Quickly, he wraps the chain around the power bar, threads a lock and clamps it shut. Turner marches over to a phone and picks it up. J.Q. sticks the weapon in his face. J.Q. (CONT'D) Don't even think about it. Turner hangs up the phone. SECURITY GUARD Hey, what are you doing? J.Q. sees the stocky SECURITY GUARD, trains the gun on him. J.Q. Hands over your head. Do it. The security guard nervously raises his hands above his head. This part wasn't covered in his training manual. J.Q. (CONT'D) Give me your gun. SECURITY GUARD I, uh, don't have a gun. J.Q. reacts awkwardly, wasn't expecting this response. J.Q. Okay. Then sit down. And stay down. The guard obediently drops into a chair. DR. TURNER Mr. Archibald, I understand how upset you are, but this is not the right way to handle it. J.Q. I tried your way, Doc. It didn't work. Now we're going to try it my way. In one of the treatment rooms, Dr. Marjorie Klein and Leo Maguire attend to a man in motorcycle leathers with a bloodied head wound. They watch J.Q. lock the ambulance entrance. DR. KLEIN Mr. Archibald. What are you doing? J.Q. I took your advice, Doctor. I'm not taking no for an answer. Several patients and medical personnel see the gun and bolt out the front door. With Turner still in tow, J.Q. hurries to the ER entrance, pulls more chains from his gym bag and secures both doors. Turning back, he sees Lester at the admitting desk arguing with Debby Utley. A clipboard with medical information forms sits in front of him. J.Q. (CONT'D) What's going on here? Lester removes the blood soaked towel. The tips of three fingers have been severed from his right hand. LESTER They want me to sign. The pen. The hand. It's not going to work. DR. TURNER Mr. Archibald, these people have nothing to do with this. You have got to let them go. They need treatment. J.Q. This is a hospital, isn't it? You're a doctor. Treat them. J.Q. points to Lester. J.Q. (CONT'D) Start with him. Turner stands frozen. J.Q. (CONT'D) What's the matter, Doc? You want to see his insurance card first? J.Q. stands on a table addressing the room. A madman with a gun. J.Q. (CONT'D) This hospital is under new management, ladies and gentlemen. From now on, free care for everyone. Various reactions from the people in the room. LESTER Far out. J.Q. points to the security guard. J.Q. You. Come with me. J.Q. leads the security guard to the elevators. J.Q. (CONT'D) Kill the power. SECURITY GUARD I don't have a key for that. J.Q. You've got the keys to the city. Now do it. Decision time. Finally the guard inserts an Allen wrench into the lock and kills the power. J.Q. takes a crowbar from his bag and jimmies the elevator control box, busting fuses and yanking wires. The elevator looks sick. It's not going anywhere. J.Q. looks around and sees a snake-eye security camera bolted to the ceiling. INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY DESK - DAY A skinny, pimple-faced KID with a big chrome badge sits in front of a dozen closed circuit monitors. On one, a man in a baseball cap is now bashing the camera with a crowbar. Ssss! A blizzard of white snow crackles on the monitor. Confused, the pimply faced kid picks up the phone. PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD Uh. This is the security desk at Hope Memorial Hospital. I think you guys better get down here. We may have a situation. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY J.Q. paces next to the windows, sizing up the room. Nearby, the Hispanic baby wails. J.Q. Everybody does exactly what I say and nobody gets hurt. He looks around the room, everybody battered, bloodied, and bruised. J.Q. (CONT'D) ...more hurt. INT. CONTROL ROOM - CHANNEL 8 - DAY FREDDY B., a superbright techie-geek, pokes his head into an office where Tuck Lampley is having a meeting with his BOSSES. FREDDY B. This just came in over the police radio. Someone is holding Hope Memorial hostage. Realizing, Lampley stares at the TV executives. TV EXEC Hope Memorial Hospital? Isn't that...? Lampley is already up and on the move. LAMPLEY Is it a good enough story for you now, George? FREDDY B. Do you think it's that guy with the kid, boss? LAMPLEY What do you think? INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY Maguire leads Lester back to the treatment area. Lester hands him a baggie filled with three-severed fingertips. LESTER Don't lose my fingers, man. Had them fingers my whole life. MITCH (under breath; to Julie) We were here before that guy. J.Q. You'll get your turn. Nobody's going anywhere for a while. J.Q. glances at the admitting desk and sees the chair move. He lifts his weapon and moves towards it. He jumps around the corner of the desk to find Debby Utley underneath, scared to death. J.Q. (CONT'D) I'm going to have to ask you to join the others, Miss. The sound of a screaming baby is cutting through the room like nails on a blackboard. J.Q. approaches Rosa, who clutches her child defensively. J.Q. (CONT'D) What's the problem? Rosa shakes her head. She doesn't speak much English. ROSA Yo no se que pasa. El llora por toda la noche. J.Q. Yo pienso que tiene dolor en su oreja. ROSA Si? En su oido? J.Q. Porque lo toca. Mira. The baby's tiny fingers reach for his ear. J.Q. singles out Debby Utley. J.Q. (CONT'D) This kid's got an ear infection. You. With J.Q.'s finger pointed at her, Debby falls apart, bursting into tears. DEBBY I can't. J.Q. Why not? DEBBY I don't know anything. It's my first. J.Q. gives her a look. "Oh, Jesus." MAGUIRE I got it. Give him this. Maguire hands a bottle of gooey pink Amoxycillin to Debby. MITCH Unbelievable. This place is a joke. Good think I'm not cut. I'd bleed to death in this joint. Am I right, my man? Mitch tries to engage J.Q. with a wink and a big flashy smile. J.Q. ignores him. MITCH (CONT'D) Excuse me? Hey, brother? Mitch. They crying baby. The tension. It's all getting to J.Q. MITCH (CONT'D) My girlfriend's in a lot of pain here. How much longer before she sees a doctor? Mitch gets up and tries to approach J.Q. J.Q. Sit down. MITCH That's cool. You and me ain't got no problems. You know what I'm saying? But do me a favor, huh? Baby's pretty banged up, and we've been waiting for hours. J.Q. I told you once already. Sit tight. MITCH That's what we've been doing. J.Q. shoots Mitch a look before moving to Miriam and Steve. J.Q. When is the baby due? MIRIAM Any minute. Oh, boy. J.Q. rubs his head. What else? CLANK. CLANK. The sound of the automatic doors banging against the chain is heard. J.Q. What's that? EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - ER ENTRANCE - DAY A red & white ambulance is parked outside. THREE PARAMEDICS are pushing against the locked doors, pounding on the glass. J.Q. runs from the treatment area, sees a body laying on a stretcher. PARAMEDIC #1 Open up. Got a gunshot victim here. Lost a lot of blood. J.Q. Take him to another hospital. PARAMEDIC #2 He won't make it. Come on. We're losing him. Open the door. J.Q. (to Maguire) You recognize these guys? MAGUIRE Yeah, they're here all the time. Paramedics #2 and #3 are wearing blue jackets, blue pants, cordovan, cushion-soled shoes. Paramedic #1 wears the same blue jacket and pants, but his shoes are black, with leather soles. J.Q. That one's a cop. MAGUIRE I was here when you brought in your son. Remember me? I shot straight with you then. I'm shooting straight with you now. I'm telling you, these guys are cool. J.Q. studies Maguire's eyes, measures his honesty, and then unchains the door and opens it, pointing the weapon. The paramedics see J.Q.'s gun and their hands go up. J.Q. You, open your coat. PARAMEDIC #1 What? J.Q. You heard me. Take the coat off. Cop. Paramedic #1 takes off his coat. There's nothing underneath. He's not police. J.Q. (CONT'D) Alright, then. Leave the stretcher. Go. Beat it. The paramedics back away and take off. Maguire rolls the stretcher inside, and J.Q. re-locks the doors. MAN ON STRETCHER (name's STAWITZKY) I gave them all the money in the register. They shot me anyway. J.Q. peels back a corner of the blanket, looks for weapons, recoils at the sight of the man's blood. Maguire moves in, squeezes the man's wrist, takes his pulse. MAGUIRE We need to prep this man for immediate surgery. He's in boo-koo trouble. Doctor? DR. TURNER No, no. This is out of my department. I'm a heart surgeon. I'm not an emergency room physician. MAGUIRE You are now. J.Q. Come on, Doctor. It's like riding a bike. Pretend you're getting paid. Turner and J.Q. lock eyes. J.Q. (CONT'D) Do it. DR. TURNER Seventy-five milligrams Demerol IV Lidocaine, local. Two percent. Turner takes the man's pulse as they roll the stretcher towards the trauma room. J.Q. watches the anesthesia cup placed over the man's nose and he goes down for the count. Mitch fires a look at the stocky security guard. MITCH When I get out of here, I'm suing this hospital and your security company. Unseen by Mitch, J.Q. has moved behind him. J.Q. What makes you so sure you're getting out of here at all? Mitch sits back down. J.Q. leans against a wall, takes a breath. Suddenly, he hears the woop-woop of police sirens. He looks out the window and sees police cars storming the front of the hospital. The cavalry has arrived. J.Q. (CONT'D) Here we go. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY The summer sun beats down as cop cars careen into the parking lot. Behind them, an unmarked Crown Victoria plows slowly through a growing crowd. LIEUTENANT FRANK GRIMES bails out before the car stops, smoothing out the wrinkles in his rumpled suit. He reacts with surprise when he sees veteran, on-the-spot news reporter, Tuck Lampley, already on the scene with his camera crew. GRIMES What are you doing here, Lampley? Shouldn't you be out exposing tragic miscarriages or justice or something? LAMPLEY Yeah, well, screw you, too. Grimes pushes past, but Lampley dogs him. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) There's a rumor floating around, Frank. Some guy's holding the hospital hostage. Needs an operation for his kid. Any truth to it? GRIMES You know more than I do. LAMPLEY You're full of shit. GRIMES Hey, then we're even. I never believe a word you guys say either. LAMPLEY This is big, isn't it, Frank? I can feel it. Come on, what do you got? GRIMES Zip. Nothing. Read my lips. I just got here. But I promise, as soon as I know anything, you'll be the last to know. LAMPLEY Hey, Grimes. You're a real horse's ass. You know that? GRIMES Yeah, well... Grimes chuckles as he moves past the police barricade, sizing up his territory. He runs into swat team SERGEANT TIM MOODY, already on the scene. Moody's accompanied by the pimply faced security guard who phoned it in. MOODY This guy's in for the long haul, Lieutenant. He locked down the ER, barricaded himself inside, killed the power on the elevators. We could bust down the door, but the sonofabitch might start killing everybody. GRIMES Any other way in? MOODY I'm working on it. GRIMES How many hostages? MOODY Security guard here said there could be anywhere from ten to twenty. GRIMES Any security cameras? PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD The guy took out the one in the ER, sir. But the hospital has two covert pinpoints hidden inside the treatment facility. GRIMES Pinpoint cameras? I don't understand. PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD The hospital's own private security. Every hospital has them, in case a mental patient goes crazy or an employee starts stealing pharmaceuticals. MOODY They're hidden in the walls throughout the hospital. There's two inside the ER area. GRIMES Can we get them? MOODY We're setting up a video tap right now. Should be up and running in a few minutes. Grimes looks at the pimply-faced kid. GRIMES Are you in charge of security? PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD No, sir. That'd be Wally Pitoniak. He's at home. It's his day off. GRIMES Not anymore it ain't. Get him down here. (to Moody) I need to make contact with this guy. Can you get me a secure line? PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD Lieutenant? One of our guys is on the inside. He's got a walkie-talk. You might want to give this a shot. The kid hands Grimes his walkie-talkie. GRIMES Alright, but put a clamp on all phone lines to the Emergency Room. If he picks up the phone, I want him talking to me. MOODY Got it. Grimes looks around, sees more news vans arriving. GRIMES And keep the media on a need to know basis. Until I say so, the press doesn't need to know nothing. Now who's in charge of this hospital? PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD Rebecca Payne, sir. She's off today, too. GRIMES Jesus Christ. Does anyone work at this hospital? PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD It's Saturday. GRIMES So what? People get sick on Saturday, don't they? INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY J.Q. watches the police build-up outside. Rosa is holding her baby, who is quieter now, not crying. J.Q. How old is he? Cuantos anos? ROSA Ocho meses. Eight month. J.Q. nods. Memories. J.Q. Eight months. Great age. Dr. Klein approaches J.Q. with Miriam. DR. KLEIN I'll need to do an internal examination on this woman. J.Q. Go. J.Q. sees Steve, the woman's husband, picking at his fingernails, anxious. J.Q. (CONT'D) Why'd you come to an ER? Why not go right to Maternity? STEVE Miriam went into labor early. Her water broke, we called our doctor, got the service. MITCH Excuse me, but I think my fiancee broke her arm. Could somebody take a look at her, please? J.Q. moves over to Julie, regards her black eye, her swollen face. MITCH (CONT'D) She's fine, ain't she? All that and twenty-two years old. Little slice of heaven. Must be doing something right, am I right? J.Q. looks at Mitch. Is this guy for real? J.Q. (to Julie) What's your story? MITCH Car accident. What does it look like? J.Q. I was talking to her. JULIE A drunk ran a red light and slammed into us. It was an accident. A muffled voice suddenly squawks on the security guard's walkie-talkie. GRIMES (O.S.) Hello? Hello? Anyone there? J.Q. grabs the guard's walkie-talkie, presses TALK. J.Q. Yeah. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - COMMAND POST - DAY INTERCUT The police have cordoned off a section of the parking lot and transformed it into a command post. Police personnel invade the area. Tables, phones, and monitors are being set up. GRIMES This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes of the Chicago Police Department. Are you the man in charge? J.Q. That's right. GRIMES Who am I speaking to? J.Q. pauses. GRIMES (CONT'D) Come on, my friend. We're going to be doing a lot of talking today. You don't have to give me your real name, but I've got to call you something. J.Q. Call me John Q. GRIMES Alright, John Q. Again, my name is Lieutenant Grimes. But I want you to call me Frank. Can you do that? J.Q. Sure, Frank. GRIMES I'm the hostage negotiator. I've been a cop for thirty-five years and this is all I do. I don't play games. And I don't fool around. So if I say something, you can take it to the bank. Now, let's get down to it. Is anybody hurt? J.Q. It's an Emergency Room, Frank. Everybody's hurt. Frank smiles. This guy's a comedian. J.Q. (CONT'D) They're fine. GRIMES Good. As long as it stays that way, we can keep talking. Grimes walks along the perimeter of the police barricade. A crowd of lookie-loos is starting to gather. GRIMES (CONT'D) Murphy's Law, John. You picked the hottest day of the year. It's a hundred degrees out here. And I'm allergic to the heat. So let's wrap this up as quickly as possible. Now, what exactly is it you want? J.Q. Find Rebecca Payne, Hope Memorial's Administrative Supervisor. Tell her I want my kid's name on the donor list. GRIMES Kid? Boy or girl? J.Q. Boy. GRIMES How old? You know, I've got two boys. Two girls and two boys. J.Q. Don't handle me, Frank. I don't want to be handled. It insults my intelligence. If I don't get what I want, you're going to have a lot of dead bodies on your hands. You only need to remember two things. My kid and the donor list. You got that? GRIMES Take it easy, John. The idea's not to get too excited. J.Q. Mike's name goes on that list or there's going to be a blood bath in here. GRIMES Alright. I hear you loud and clear. Rebecca Payne, right? I'm writing it down. Lot of cops out here, John. Are you sure you want to go through with this? J.Q. I'm sure. GRIMES Alright. Sit tight. You're in a tough spot, John. A lot of trouble. But if you work with me, if you're reasonable, we'll figure a way out of this. We have to have a little faith in one another. J.Q. Why? GRIMES Why? Because that's what faith's all about. Believing when you don't want to believe. Besides, what else are you going to do? J.Q. Just tell Payne. Donor list. She'll understand. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - COMMAND POST - DAY The line goes dead. GRIMES Alright, what the hell is a donor list? INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY J.Q. paces the floor. It's slower now. Everyone just sitting around, waiting to see what will happen. Debby has pulled herself together for the time being. She calls out to John. DEBBY Mr. Q? Would you really do it? J.Q. What? DEBBY What you said about the bloodbath? Would you really shoot us? J.Q. I'll do what I have to do to help my kid. MITCH Aw, bullshit. He can't shoot us all. There's only eight bullets in that weapon. J.Q. First one's got your name on it, Mitch. Mitch mumbles and kicks his feet up, sparking a cigarette. J.Q. keeps pacing back and forth, and Steve is still picking them fingernails. J.Q. (CONT'D) First child? STEVE Yes, sir. You know how it is, kind of nervous. J.Q. nods, understands. J.Q. What are you hoping for? Boy or girl? STEVE Miriam wants a baby girl. Doesn't matter to me, as long as the baby's healthy. Steve stops short. Realizing his faux pas. STEVE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I didn't meant -- J.Q. shakes it off: "Not to worry." John notices Julie, her arm now in a sling, not broken. J.Q. Who was driving? (off Julie's look) The car. MITCH I was. What's that got to do with it? J.Q. How come she got all banged up and you didn't? MITCH What do you call this? Mitch pulls back his hair, shows off his wounds. Surface scratches on his arms and around his neck and face. LESTER Somebody get this man a band-aid. MITCH Shut up, smart ass. It hurts. JULIE His airbag went off. Mine didn't. J.Q. What kind of car do you drive there, hot shot? MITCH Mercedes 500. J.Q. A Benz, huh? MITCH Sixteen valve. One point six liter. It does about a hundred and eighty in reverse. J.Q. Wow. Pretty snazzy. What year? MITCH 1986. It's a classic. The other hostages study J.Q. Where is he going with this? J.Q. Yeah, well, I've got news for you, Mitch. Mercedes didn't install passenger airbags until 1988. A long uncomfortable silence ensues as the group looks at Mitch, realizing the obvious. Busted. MITCH I was drunk. Alright? Tears stream down Julie's proud face, for the first time, Mitch is speechless. He looks like a car that won't start. Finally, he gets up and walks away. LESTER Well, well, well. My man, Mitch. Mister girlfriend beater. What do you got to say now, bitch? Maguire and Turner enter. Maguire's got a big smile on his face. J.Q. How's Stawitzky? DR. TURNER He's going to make it. J.Q. How's it feel, Doc? Saving a life? Feels pretty good, doesn't it? INT. MIKE'S ICU ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON Monitor. Plink. Mike's blood pressure drops from 75 to 74. Mike is resting, eyes closed. Denise stands vigilantly by Mike's bedside. Reggie enters. Carrying an armload of medicine. He replaces the IV bag and starts to administer the meds. One after the other, Reggie injects them into the IV line, and Mike stirs. DENISE What's that? REGGIE Lasix. It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up. But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement. DENISE And those? REGGIE Dopamine. For his blood pressure. Dig for his heart. Primacor. DENISE Gosh, it seems like so much. REGGIE Yeah, it's a lot. This is antibiotic. DENISE What for? REGGIE It's prophylactic. Just in case. These two, I don't really know what they're for. Pain, maybe. DENISE Pain? REGGIE I don't know, Mrs. Archibald. I just do what they tell me. Mike groans. He feels queasy and his mouth is bone dry. MIKE I don't feel good. REGGIE This is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes, buddy. But I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on. How does that sound? Mike forces a smile, dips his head slightly. "Sounds good." Reggie leaves the room. Something catches Denise's eye. Down the Pediatric ICU, she sees the hospital chaplain again. There is a commotion. The parents are crying. And a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child. The chaplain tries to console the devastated mother, who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room. MIKE Mom? Is Dad coming? DENISE Yeah. He's coming. MIKE Where is he? Denise steals a final look at the parents overcome with grief. DENISE I don't know, sweetheart. I don't know. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - DAY Mitch is snooping around one of the treatment rooms, always careful to keep an eye on J.Q. He nearly jumps out of his skin when he sees the security guard standing next to him. SECURITY GUARD What are you up to? MITCH Never mind me. You're worthless. You know that? Some security guard. You should have zapped the bastard. SECURITY GUARD With what? Besides, I'm not putting my neck on the line. Not for eight-fifty an hour. Mitch reaches, pulls a cas cart closer. He carefully slides open a drawer, steals a sharp-edged scalpel, slips it into his pocket. Next he spots a spray top cannister marked Ethychloride. SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D) What the hell are you doing? MITCH Looking out for number one. SECURITY GUARD You want to stay alive? Sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here. MITCH Wake up, fat boy. The cops are coming in shooting. They don't give a shit about his kid. And as soon as he realizes that, we're history. SECURITY GUARD Yeah? He finds out you got a scalpel, you're the one that's history, asshole. MITCH Really? He doesn't look so bad to me. SECURITY GUARD Listen. MITCH No, listen to me, you stupid rent-a-cop. I'm not a slob. I've got a life, and it means something to me. I'm not dying in this shithole. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY The vending machines have been jimmied open and a huge pile of candy bars and soda cans sit on the waiting room table. Everybody is chowing down. J.Q. The thing I don't understand is why no one caught it before. Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born. Why didn't his doctors pick it up? DR. TURNER Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur? J.Q. Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time. DR. TURNER He might not have been tested thoroughly enough. J.Q. Why not? MAGUIRE You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner. J.Q. Is that true? DR. TURNER Possible. Not likely, but possible. J.Q. Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago? DR. TURNER Who knows? LESTER Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks. MAGUIRE You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money. LESTER It's all about getting paid, man. MAGUIRE And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve. LESTER Because then no one gets paid. JULIE But what about that thing you guys take? That promise? What do they call it? STEVE The Hippocratic oath. LESTER More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me. How's that go, Doc? "I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?" MAGUIRE I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing. JULIE Hospitals can't turn people away. STEVE Yeah. I thought there were laws about that. MAGUIRE There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook. Turner is getting hot. DR. TURNER That's not how it works. MAGUIRE That's exactly how it works. Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door. MITCH Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc? Finally, Turner explodes. DR. TURNER Shut up. Enough already. I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand. Sure, the system sucks. There's red tape and there's worse. There's tough luck. And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun? Turner gets up and walks into the treatment room. JULIE Wow. MITCH What's his problem? STEVE I've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and I couldn't get help, I don't know what I'd do. DEBBY Me, neither. STEVE But I'd do something. J.Q. glances quickly at the clock. He picks up the phone, clicking the button, trying to get a dial tone. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - COMMAND POST - DAY INTERCUT A black SWAT phone starts ringing and the policemen freeze. Where's Grimes? A COMPUTER COP runs over and calls out to the lieutenant. COMPUTER COP Sir! Grimes waves him off and cues his portable. GRIMES This is Frank Grimes. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM J.Q., confused. J.Q. But... GRIMES The line is clipped, John. You pick up the phone, you get me. (then) Can I help you with something? J.Q. Where are we at with that list? GRIMES I'm working on it, John. But I need some time. J.Q. Time I don't have, Lieutenant. GRIMES I want to talk about the hostages. J.Q. What about them? GRIMES What's going on in there? How are they? J.Q. Same as they were before, Frank. We're all just kind of waiting on you. At the command post, Moody is now waving his arms. Grimes moves over and looks at the monitors. The videotape is up. The images are wide and grainy. Giving him his first look at the hostages. ON THE SCREEN, J.Q. moves into frame. Moody taps the screen and Grimes nods. That's our guy. GRIMES I want you to let some of them go. J.Q. What for? GRIMES I do for you. You do for me. Show some good faith. We've got a lot of nervous people out here, John. Make everybody breathe a lot easier if we saw some happy faces. J.Q. Good faith only takes you so far. You see, I believe in the merit system. And so far, you haven't earned any points. EXT. COMMAND POST - DAY A navy blue unmarked Crown Victoria pulls up and out steps Rebecca Payne and POLICE CHIEF GUS MONROE. They are quickly ushered over to the monitors where they see J.Q.'s face on the screens. PAYNE That's him. His name is John Archibald. His son's on the fifth floor, Pediatric ICU. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY Marjorie Klein moves over with a very hysterical Miriam in tow. DR. KLEIN Excuse me. J.Q. holds up a finger telling her to wait. DR. KLEIN (CONT'D) I need to talk to you. Now. J.Q. (into phone) Can you hold on a minute, Frank? DR. KLEIN This woman's six centimeters dilated and the baby is breech. I can't do anything for her here. She needs to be moved to Maternity immediately. J.Q. rubs his eyes and lets out a breath. He's under a lot of stress. EXT. COMMAND POST - DAY Grimes has his hand over the receiver as he barks out orders to Moody. GRIMES Put people on the door. Nobody talks to the wife but me. Grimes sticks out his free hand to Monroe, who shakes it. GRIMES (CONT'D) Good to see you, Gus. How are you? MONROE Hot. What's going on? GRIMES You're looking at it. J.Q. (O.S.) Are you there, Frank? GRIMES Yeah, I'm here. J.Q. (O.S.) I changed my mind. I am going to let some of the hostages go. GRIMES Great, John. That's the right thing. J.Q. (O.S.) But when I do, the clock starts. You have one hour to get back to me with some good news. Monroe is glued to the monitors. His wheels are already spinning. Grimes covers the receiver to speak to him. GRIMES Isn't it a little early for you to be here, Gus? Who called in the heavy artillery? J.Q. (O.S.) I mean it, Frank. If my boy's not on the list in an hour, I promise you someone's going to die. MONROE This is bad, Frank. Lot of people watching this one. Big embarrassment if it doesn't go away real quiet like. GRIMES Well, give me some time. I'm working on it. J.Q. (O.S.) Frank? GRIMES I got it, John. I'm hearing you. One hour. They look on Monroe's face tells Grimes that something is wrong. GRIMES (CONT'D) Gus? MONROE There's no time on this one, Frank. This one's just got to go away. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY J.Q. puts down the walkie-talkie and points at Miriam and Rosa. J.Q. You and you. Come with me. Maguire, give me a hand. MIRIAM Mr. Archibald. Please let my husband go with me. STEVE Honey, for godsakes, just do as the man says. Get out of here. MIRIAM I'm not leaving you here alone. MITCH Shit, I'll go. STEVE Shut your face. What kind of man are you? MITCH Screw you, Tyrone. Steve leaps from his seat and goes after Mitch, bristling with the racial slur. J.Q. moves in fast, trying to separate them. But instead of going for Steve, Mitch goes for broke and rushes J.Q. The Ethylchloride is out and Mitch sprays it into J.Q.'s eyes, temporarily blinding him. John tries to get his bearings but Mitch is already swinging the scalpel. As J.Q. blocks the knife, his arm is sliced and starts to gush. Mitch goes for the kill, but J.Q. grabs his arm and they wrestle to the ground, the scalpel and John's gun clattering to the floor. The element of surprise gone, Mitch is now getting the worst of it. J.Q. is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it. Mitch sees the gun across the floor next to Julie. MITCH (CONT'D) Julie, baby, get the gun. Julie gets up. MITCH (CONT'D) Shoot him, honey. Shoot him. But instead of grabbing the weapon, she picks up the Ethylchloride, sprays it directly in Mitch's eyes from superclose range and doesn't stop. Mitch's hands fly to his eyes and he screams. J.Q. gets up and recovers his weapon, sticking it in his waistband. Julie stands over Mitch, who is still writhing in pain. MITCH (CONT'D) You stupid bitch! Julie rears back, and with her go-go boot, she kicks Mitch square in the groin. JULIE That's for beating the shit out of me. She kicks him again. JULIE (CONT'D) That's for being an asshole. Once more for good measure. JULIE (CONT'D) And that's for calling me a bitch. LESTER Damn. The hostages look at Julie with newfound respect. J.Q. takes the security guard's handcuffs, drags Mitch across the floor, and manacles him to the radiator. J.Q. Everybody's a tough guy. Grimes voice crackles over the walkie-talkie. GRIMES (O.S.) Where are those hostages, John? J.Q. moves to the door, unlocks the chain, points to Rosa and Miriam. J.Q. Let's go. Both of you. Rosa launches into a rapid-fire monologue of thanks. She speaks quickly, saying the word "Dios" over and over. DEBBY What's she saying? MAGUIRE She said she'll pray for his boy. Miriam kisses Steve, holds him tight. STEVE Everything's going to be okay. The baby is going to be just fine. J.Q. puts a hand on Steve's shoulder. J.Q. Get out of here. Go. Steve is stunned. Can't get to his feet. J.Q. (CONT'D) Vasta. Vasta. Let's go. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY The front door opens and Steve, Miriam, Rosa and the baby are released. We see Channel 8 reporter Tuck Lampley doing a live "stand up." LAMPLEY The gunman has just freed several hostages who will immediately be debriefed by members of the crisis team. Will the man known as John Q. get a heart for his little boy? Time will tell. Where this leads next is anyone's guess. Live from Hope Memorial Hospital, this is Tuck Lampley. The hostages are hustled through the police barricade by a team of kevlar riot police. The media rush the hostages, shouting out questions and frantically trying to stick their microphones close enough. REPORTER #1 Is it true an ambulance dropped off a gunshot victim after the gunman took over the ER? MIRIAM Yes. He unlocked the door and let him in. STEVE If he didn't, the man would have died. ROSA John Q. very good man. REPORTER #2 The gunman? ROSA Si. Good man, el senor. But Tuck Lampley's attention is on the police command post where dozens of blue uniforms crowd around a small bank of monitors. Suddenly, it hits him. LAMPLEY They've got a camera in there. I don't believe it. They're watching a video feed. Freddy B. squints through the glasses. FREDDY B. How do you know? LAMPLEY Well, they're looking at something, Freddy. And I need to know what it is. Can you steal it? FREDDY B. No problem, boss. If they got it, I can get it. EXT. COMMAND POST - DAY WALLY PITONIAK, Chief of Hospital Security, has arrived. He and Sergeant Moody are standing over an unrolled building plan that has been stretched across the command table like a battle map. Monroe and Grimes have Rebecca Payne on the defensive. GRIMES You mean all of this could have been avoided if you had just put the kid's name on a list? PAYNE Don't you dare try to blame this on me. You think Mr. Archibald is the only one with a sick child? Try the HIV ward. There's a whole floor full of them. People get sick. They die. That's the way it goes. I'm faced with tough decisions every day. MONROE The fact is there's a man threatening to kill innocent people because you refused treatment for his son. PAYNE The fact is there are fifty million people in this country without medical insurance, sir. And there's one of me in every hospital. That's not my fault. It's just the way the country's set up. You want to change it? Write your congressman. Moody looks over from his map. MOODY Excuse me, but why don't we just tell him his son's on the list? Doesn't that make sense? I mean, how's he going to know. MONROE That's not a bad idea. PAYNE You want me to put his name on the list, fine, but it's a mistake. You give in to this man, there's going to be guns in every hospital in America. MONROE I don't personally care if you put the kid on it or not. That's your conscience. But give us a hand, will you honey? Work with us. Tell him his kid's going to be alright. Do you think you can do that? Pitoniak has indicated a spot on the schematic by circling it with a red pen. MOODY Sir? Sir, take a look at this. Monroe moves over. MONROE What is it? Pitoniak points to the map, marking a red "X" through the circle. PITONIAK It's a phone. MONROE So? Moody points to one of the monitors. ON SCREEN, a view of the nurse's station and beyond. And in the foreground, big and clear as day, is the RED NURSES' PHONE. MOODY It's that phone. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY More waiting. MITCH So, what now? What's the plan? JULIE Mitch... MITCH No. I want to know. Every day you read about this kind of shit. And now we're in the middle of it. How is it going to end, John? This country, man. I swear to God. You can't go anywhere anymore without getting robbed, mugged, or murdered. Kids killing classmates, drive bys... I won't even go into a post office anymore. MAGUIRE Shut up, Mitch. J.Q. He's right. You know how easy it was to get this gun? One gun show. Five minutes. MITCH That's right. You're just a punk with a gun. I understand your kid is sick, but what makes him better than me? I've got a life, too. J.Q. Yeah, but you've got insurance. MITCH So, what, you're going to shoot me? Because that's what you're telling the cops. If poor little Mikey doesn't get the very first heart available, all of us die. J.Q. No, I don't want to cheat anyone. I just want my kid to have a fair shot. MITCH So what's the plan, Stan? I mean, exactly? How long are you going to hold us hostage? Until your son gets a new heart? J.Q. I don't know. MITCH Think, Einstein. Use your head. Correct me if I'm wrong, Doctor, but hearts don't come just like that. It takes months, years sometimes. J.Q. I know. MITCH Then what's your move? J.Q. I'm not letting my kid die! I'm out of options, alright?! I have no more ideas. This is it. The end of the road. I'm looking for an act of God. I'm looking for a miracle. EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY The white BMW speeds along the highway, tries to pass the semi in front of her, and smashes into the embankment. It's the same accident as before, only this time, it's regular speed. INT. PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - DAY Frank Grimes stands outside Mike's room, just watching him through the glass. CLOSE ON MONITOR Mike's blood pressure has fallen to 68. He is asleep, each breath magnified by the hollow, mechanized wheeze of the ventilator pump. Denise sits by his side, praying hard, tears rolling down her cheeks. Payne arrives, and the two stand there a moment. Watching the scene, Grimes is visibly moved. Even Payne and her super bitch attitude are a little humbled. PAYNE No matter how many times I see it, this is the part I always hate. GRIMES Do you have any children, Miss Payne? PAYNE No. No I don't. They move to the doorway and tap lightly on the door. GRIMES Mrs. Archibald? Denise's wet face turns to see the cause of the intrusion. GRIMES (CONT'D) Could we have a word with you? INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY Denise, Grimes, and Payne by the elevators. DENISE This is my fault. When the hospital told me they were releasing Mikey, I was furious. I yelled at John to do something, anything. I never thought... GRIMES I understand. Is he a violent man, Mrs. Archibald. DENISE No. Heavens, no. He's gentle. He's sweet. He wouldn't hurt a fly. GRIMES That's not what he's saying. He's talking about killing people. Has he spent any time in the military? DENISE Hey, what is this? I get what's going on here. You want me to tell you something you can use to hurt my husband. GRIMES He's in a lot of trouble, Ma'am. We're going to need you to talk to him. DENISE Let's get something straight, Mister. You can't use me to make a case against John. I support my husband. Whatever he does. I'm on his side. Not yours. PAYNE Mrs. Archibald... DENISE You, don't talk to me. I'd tell you what I think of you but I'm a Christian woman. Now you people leave me alone. I have a sick child to look after. PAYNE I've decided to put Mike's name on the organ recipient list, Mrs. Archibald. The hospital will pay for everything. Denise looks at Payne, not daring to believe. DENISE Really. Payne nods. This is too much for Denise. She throws her arms around Payne, sobbing tears of joy. DENISE (CONT'D) Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Payne pats Denise on the back, awkwardly trying to comfort her. INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - DAY Grimes and Payne move quickly through the corridors. GRIMES You're good. PAYNE Excuse me? GRIMES With the Archibald woman back there. Quite a performance. The sincere look, the comforting embrace. For a minute, I almost believed you cared. Payne's eyes flash with anger. She looks like she wants to say something, but she just turns and walks away. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY A restless crowd encircles the hospital, cordoned off by police blockades, uniformed cops forming a human wall around people. EMS rescue vehicles rumble onto the scene, sirens blaring. A police bus drives slowly into the parking lot. A SWAT team, dressed in flak jackets and riot gear, pours out. An armada of soft drink, hot dog and ice cream vendors smell gold, and stake out their claims. It's Saturday afternoon, and the circus is in town. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. and the hostages watch Tuck Lampley on an overhead TV. Jimmy Palumbo is being interviewed. ON SCREEN, J.Q. sees the massive police build-up, swallows. He looks at the clock. 5:05 PM. Ten minutes and counting. EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON A red and white medical helicopter descends from the sky. The accident scene is now secured by the flashing lights of police and medical teams. The screeching sound of cutting metal is heard as the rescuers use the jaws of life. As we see the car more closely now, we notice that the woman's arm rests out the open window. On her wrist is a silver donor bracelet. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON Grimes returns to find the post empty. Nobody there except a few policemen and Sergeant Moody, who is doing a check on his walkie. GRIMES What's going on? Where is everybody? Moody indicates the map and the monitor. MOODY We're sending in one of ours through the ventilation ducts. ON SCREEN He indicates the red nurses' phone. MOODY (CONT'D) If we can get the target to that phone, it's a clear shot. GRIMES Is that right? MOODY Yes, Lieutenant. That is right. GRIMES On who's orders? INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON Police Chief Gus Monroe, Wally Pitoniak, and a SWAT Team are in strategy session. They surround a sniper decked out in HBT regalia. A green video mini-monitor is being checked and fastened to the front of the sniper's vest. In the distance, Grimes bursts into the parking garage. GRIMES Gus... MONROE Not one word. I don't want to hear one goddamn word out of you, Frank. GRIMES I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to go get you your red nose. MONROE What did you say to me? Are you calling me a clown? Monroe goes after Grimes and has to be restrained. MONROE (CONT'D) I swear to God, I'll kill you. Boys. Boys. GRIMES You going to do this behind my back, you sonofabitch? MONROE Check the time, Frank. Look at your watch, Frank. The guy said at a quarter after he was going to start killing everybody, and we don't have any reason not to believe him. GRIMES So goddamn stupid. MONROE Yeah? What's your great idea? GRIMES There are no great ideas! MONROE Right! Exactly. But right now I've got a shot at this guy. I don't even know what we're talking about. You know the score. You always take the clear shot. GRIMES The wife has agreed to speak to him. Let her talk him down. MONROE That's exactly what we're going to do. GRIMES What? You use the man's wife to set him up? MONROE Whatever works. Let me paint a picture for you. And I hope it's clear. What we've got is a lose/lose. If this guy starts whacking out the hostages, it's bad, right? But if we give in to this asshole, it's also bad. GRIMES Bad for who? MONROE It's an election year. Do you want me to spell it out for you? A, B, C. However it goes down, this guy's not going to make it. GRIMES So, you kill him? That's a P.R. bonanza. MONROE There's not going to be a slaughter in there. Not on my watch. You're out, Frank. GRIMES Out? MONROE Out. No hard feelings. But you're officially relieved of duty. I'll handle it from here. GRIMES You? MONROE It's not my first trip around the dance floor, you know. Grimes laughs out loud. GRIMES Yeah. MONROE Hey, I don't like it any better than you do, but I'm under a lot of pressure here. Everyone is wetting their pants on this one. Believe me, my ass is swinging in the breeze. Monroe turns and walks away. Grimes calls out after him. GRIMES What about the hostages? MONROE They better keep their heads down. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. paces back and forth looking at the clock. His level of irritation is growing exponentially. J.Q. Where the hell are these guys? Mitch is now contrite and trying to reconcile with his battered girlfriend. MITCH Julie... JULIE Leave me alone. MITCH I'm sorry. I'm a lousy drunk, okay? I get out of control. I don't mean to, but I do and I lose my mind. But that doesn't mean I don't love you. And I'll change. I swear to God, I will. It's you and me, baby. All the girls in the club, they don't mean shit to me. It's only you. I'll get down on my knees if you want me to. Look, I'm on my knees in front of everyone. I'll even forget you kicked me in the nuts. Come on. JULIE No, Mitch. This is always how it goes. You treat me like shit, then come crawling back to me like Prince Charming. Not this time. It's over. She takes off a big diamond from her finger and drops it on the floor. It bounces and disappears under a table. MITCH Aw, come on. Don't do that. That ring cost me twenty grand. JULIE Poor little rich boy. Used to getting everything he wants. Buying his way in and out of everything. Lester bends over and tries inconspicuously to look for the ring. The security guard gets on his hands and knees. Even Debby sneaks a peek. MITCH Do you mind? Stay away from the ring, please. SECURITY GUARD Hey, she don't want it. LESTER yeah. Finders keepers, man. The hostages laugh and Mitch goes crazy. J.Q. Hey, what's so funny? Does everybody think this is a joke? You all should be thinking about your own lives, hoping that phone rings with some good news. Because in about five minutes, the road is going to get a lot narrower. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON Monroe moves outside and joins the other SWAT team personnel at the video tap. Grimes follows to plead his case. GRIMES But he's not a wacko, Gus. Married with a family, no history of mental illness. No radical political views. He doesn't fit the profile. MONROE Don't matter. You know as well as I do that anybody can fit the profile at any time. MOODY He's got a gun and he's got hostages. That's a profile. GRIMES How long have we been doing this? You've got to trust me on this one. Gus, I like the guy. MONROE Well I don't. I don't like nut jobs who point guns at innocent people. It pisses me off. GRIMES He's not a nut job. MONROE Maybe you're right. Maybe he's bluffing. Maybe he's just a nice guy with a problem. Maybe he's misunderstood and needs to blow off a little steam. Hey, it's possible. But I can't depend on that, Frank. This asshole has raised the stakes real high. And I need to match it, just in case he's not bluffing. Now, we've got five minutes before he starts throwing bodies out the door. I've got a chance to end this right now and I'm taking it. GRIMES I'm telling you, you're making a mistake. MONROE Yeah, well. We try harder. GRIMES I want to be on the record. Monroe hands Grimes a set of headphones. MONROE You can be on whatever you want. Now I got you a chair. Put these on and have a seat. GRIMES Gus... MONROE Will you stop already? Jesus, Frank. You're so emotional. On one of the monitors WE SEE the ER room and hostages. On the other, the red nurses' phone. The images are black and white and grainy. MOODY (into walkie-talkie) This is Moody. Let's go. INT. HOSPITAL ENGINE AND POWER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Pitoniak climbs along the narrow catwalk until he reaches the area that houses the air-conditioning unit. We hear the thunderous sound of an enormous compressor. Pitoniak reaches for the AC on/off switch. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. paces. Everyone keeps looking at the clock. 5:12 PM. Three minutes to go. J.Q. Some first day, huh? DEBBY A little more stressful than I thought it would be. J.Q. cracks a smile. Just then, a loud rattle echoes through the ER, pipes clanging. J.Q. What was that? SECURITY GUARD Air conditioning unit just shut off. J.Q. Yeah? Why? SECURITY GUARD The power automatically shuts down when the thermostat hits a certain temperature. TIGHT ON J.Q. Something doesn't feel right. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON INTERCUT An armed SNIPER pops his head up and slithers along the plated aluminum floor of an AC duct, a remote mini-monitor in the palm of his hand. EXT. NEWS VAN - LATE AFTERNOON Snipers lock and load assault rifles, and Tuck Lampley's crew frantically unspools fiber optic cable line to a hospital outsource, cutting and splicing it back to the news van. LAMPLEY Where's my picture? FREDDY B. Coming. We just need to unscramble the police encryptment. We're almost there. LAMPLEY Well, hurry up. I've got a contact in cardiology. The cops are setting up a phone call with this guy and his wife. This is going to be unbelievable. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON The sniper continues to crawl through the duct toward a light emanating from a louvered grill. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON Moody looks at his watch, synchronizes. Monroe does. MOODY (into walkie-talkie) Are you with a wife? Good. Let's patch it through. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 5:14 PM. All eyes on the clock. Hostages tired, hot, emotionally spent. Suddenly, a phone clangs. J.Q. looks around, surprised. He sees a desk phone, picks it up. Dead. He moves to another phone. Nothing. But the mysterious phone continues to ring. J.Q. Where's the phone? Which phone is it? INT. NEWS VAN - LATE AFTERNOON News monitors cackle with white snow. No picture. Freddy B. works the equipment. Lampley pokes his head in. LAMPLEY Come on, goddammit. They're putting the call through. Suddenly, an audio hook-up. The phone clanging like an alarm bell. FREDDY B. Oh, yeah. We got sound. LAMPLEY Good. Good. But where's the video? Come on. I need picture. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. moves from phone to phone with no luck. The phone keeps ringing. Finally he moves into the corridor, spotting a red phone at the nurses' station. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON VIDEO TAP Surreal, distorted focus, like a funhouse mirror. Suddenly, J.Q. races into frame and snatches the phone. J.Q. This better be good, Frank. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON DENISE (O.S.) John? J.Q. Denise? DENISE (O.S.) Hi, baby. We're on the list! J.Q. What? DENISE (O.S.) Payne was just here. Mike's name is on the list. You did it. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON The hostages are glued to the TV, watching covering from the outside about what's happening on the inside. J.Q. Okay. Great. We're on the list. Wow. How's Mikey doing? DENISE (O.S.) Not so good, baby. He looks like he's going away. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON Cops are glued to the monitor. Grimes looks on, disgusted. INT. MIKE'S ICU ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON DENISE They've done everything they can but he keeps getting worse and worse. Oh my God, our poor baby. Denise cracks. Tears come and there's no stopping them. INT. CRAWL SPACE - LATE AFTERNOON The sniper pops off the grill, revealing the acoustic tile of the ceiling below. He raises the microphone to his mouth. SNIPER Two zero to base camp. I'm in position one. MOODY (O.S.) Go. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON John rests his head and closes his eyes as he listens to his wife falling apart. DENISE (O.S.) You know, sometimes I think he's an angel. A real angel, sent down to keep us company for a while. J.Q. It's going to be alright, sweetheart. DENISE (O.S.) Are you praying for him? Are you praying for our boy? J.Q. Yeah, baby. I'm praying. DENISE (O.S.) Oh my God, what are we going to do? J.Q. I don't know. DENISE (O.S.) Maybe we should let him go. Maybe it's meant to be and we should accept it. J.Q. No. Don't say it. DENISE (O.S.) I don't know what else to think. The priest keeps coming. He wants to give him last rites. J.Q. Denise, don't you lose faith now. Not you. You can't give up. Mikey's going to make it. I swear on my life, he's going to make it. You've got to believe. DENISE (O.S.) Okay, baby. I'll believe. J.Q. Is he awake? Can I talk to him? INT. NEWS VAN - LATE AFTERNOON On the monitors, the blizzard of white snow morphs into a clear picture of J.Q. on the phone. Mike's tired voice suddenly comes over the audio. MIKE (O.S.) Dad? EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON INTERCUT Lampley is giving the thumbs up. They have picture. LAMPLEY Are we good? Beautiful baby. You're a genius. Lampley puts on his most sincere look as the Channel 8 news team goes live. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) This is Tuck Lampley at Hope Memorial Hospital, where we are bringing you exclusive live coverage of a phone call between the father and the son he is fighting so desperately to save. ON POLICE VIDEO TAP CAMERA WE SEE J.Q. Leaning against the wall. Father and son's 911 static scratched voices crackling. J.Q. Mike? How you doing, buddy? You hanging in there? MIKE (O.S.) Uh-huh. How are you? J.Q. Me? I'm fine. Don't worry about me. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON The sniper crawls from the louvered grill, moving along two metal support rails. He takes a crouching position over the acoustic tile. INT. MIKE'S ICU ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Mike is propped up in bed, now breathing with some difficulty. He's so weak, Denise has to hold the phone. MIKE How come you're not here, Dad? Where are you? J.Q. (O.S.) Oh, I'm kind of tied up right now. I can't get away. INTERCUTTING SHOTS OF TV SETS AROUND THE NATION Quick, jagged CUTS: American families. People in bars. TV appliance stores. Even the hostages in the ER. Awestruck at what they're witnessing. INT. MIKE'S ICU ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON MIKE Mom says I need a new heart. J.Q. (O.S.) That's right, champ. MIKE What's wrong with my heart? J.Q. (O.S.) Not a thing, buddy. Not a thing. We just have to put a new one in so you can be stronger, okay? MIKE Okay. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON The sniper lifts a ceiling tile, exposing the treatment room below. There, across the room, is J.Q. talking on the phone. INT. MIKE'S ICU ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON INTERCUT Mike stops to catch his breath. He's really on his last legs. He just lays there a second before asking the big one. MIKE Hey, Dad? J.Q. (O.S.) Yeah, Mike. MIKE Am I going to die? Denise's hand flies to her mouth. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON THE SNIPER He pushes the barrel of his weapon through the opening in the ceiling and puts his eye to the scope. SNIPER POV Through the scope, J.Q.'s tormented face racks into focus, but he moves behind a partition. The shot is not clear. J.Q. No, Mikey, you're not going to die. MIKE (O.S.) How do you know? J.Q. Hey, what good would the world be without you? Without you, there is no world. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON Lampley stands by the news van watching the drama unfold on the monitor before him. He's a little choked up. LAMPLEY Oh my God. This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. This is my white Bronco. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. Hey, Mike. MIKE (O.S.) Yeah, Dad? SNIPER POV - SCOPE MATTE J.Q. moves out from behind the partition and into the open. He's a sitting duck now. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON The sniper cues his mic. SNIPER On your call. INT. EMERGENCY WAITING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON INTERCUT The hostages are glued to the TV set. Maguire, Julie, Debby, Marjorie Klein hang on J.Q.'s every word. J.Q. You know how much I love you, don't you? How proud I am of you? MIKE (O.S.) Yeah. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON Monroe nods at Moody. It's time. MOODY (into walkie-talkie) Take the shot. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON From across the room and through the ceiling, a small red light snaps on. WE ZOOM IN to see what it is. J.Q. Yeah, well, I wanted to tell you that. Just in case I forgot. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON SNIPER POV J.Q. is in the crosshairs. Dead center. The red laser dot square in the middle of his back. J.Q. Give me a Chris Cormeir, will you? Yah! MIKE (O.S.) Oh, yeah. Chris Cormeir. He's great. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON The hostages attention has been so focused on the screen, none of them have realized that for John to be on TV, there has to be a camera inside the ER. Suddenly, it hits Lester. LESTER What the hell. Oh, shit... INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON TIGHT ON THE TRIGGER. As the sniper squeezes -- INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. Get some rest, buddy. Okay? MIKE (O.S.) Okay. I love you, Dad. J.Q. Yeah. I love you, too. As J.Q. hangs up the receiver, the sniper pulls the trigger. LESTER Hey, John. You're on the TV, you know that? BANG! John turns as the bullet explodes from the chamber, muzzle flashing. A bullet blows through J.Q.'s shoulder, knocking him backwards against the wall. EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON The echoing gunshot rumbles through the air like a thunderclap. Monroe, Moody, Grimes and Payne react as the hostages scatter. MOODY He's down. We got him. He's down. Grimes pulls off his cans. GRIMES Your kids are lucky, Gus. Their father's coming home tonight. MEDIA MONITORS, POLICE VIDEO TAP, TV SETS The cops. Lampley. America. All tuned into the -- INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON Sheer pandemonium. Hostages run for cover. The phone receiver swings back and forth, and a bloody J.Q. is slumped against the wall. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON Lampley continues his live coverage as horrified crowds move around him. LAMPLEY All we know at this point is that an attempt has been made on the gunman's life. Repeat. John Q. has been shot. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATER J.Q. sits, his shirt soaked in blood. Among all the madness, something funny happens. INT. DUCT SYSTEM - LATE AFTERNOON The sniper loses his balance and his leg crashes through the acoustic tile ceiling. He is momentarily stuck. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON J.Q. blinks. The wound, the hysteria, the events of the day, and now a leg sticking through the ceiling. It's all very surreal. He gets up, moves to the leg, and pulls. And the ceiling comes crashing down. EXT. COMMAND POST Stunned, Monroe, Moody, Grimes and Payne grimly watch J.Q. subduing the sniper on the video tape monitors. Their faces are in stark contrast with the chaos that surrounds them. MOODY He's not down. GRIMES This is very bad, Gus. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN runs up with a cell phone and hands it to Monroe. MONROE Not now. POLICEMAN It's the Mayor, sir. And you better kill that video feed. The media's pirated the signal and the whole thing just went out live over national TV. As Monroe takes the phone and Moody starts barking out orders, the feed is disconnected, and the monitors go blank. EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - GOLDEN HOUR The beautiful woman's body is loaded onto the medivac. The helicopter lifts off and disappears into the darkening sky. INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT The daisy wheel keeps on turning. WE SEE the words as they're printed. Vernell Tilson. Status 2. Arthur Friedlander. Status 3. Amy Podgorsky. Status 2. And a new entry, Mike Archibald, Age 9, 85 pounds. It's official. He's on the list. Status 1. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - GOLDEN HOUR The sniper now sits restrained to a chair, his hands and feet bound by adhesive tape. The other hostages are somber, knowing that they are caught smack in the middle of this mess. J.Q. sits stripped to the waist as Maguire removes the bullet from his shoulder, his wheel spinning, spinning. J.Q. It's over. Mikey's not going to make it. JULIE But the list. J.Q. What list? They're shooting at me. They're not going to help my kid. It's time to change plans. DR. KLEIN What about an El-vad? DR. TURNER No. J.Q. What's an El-vad? DR. KLEIN A left Ventricular Assist Device. It's basically a pump inserted into the chest cavity, wired to the heart to keep it stimulated. J.Q. All this time there's been a way to save his life and you never said anything? DR. TURNER It's not a solution. It's only a band aid. Mike's immune system may be too weak. J.Q. Will it give him time? DR. TURNER Not long. It's only a temporary measure. J.Q. My kid's down to hours and minutes, Doc. Things don't get more temporary than that. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - GOLDEN HOUR The police are unceremoniously disconnecting Channel 8's pirated signal, hassling Lampley's crew, and telling them they are all going to be arrested. LAMPLEY You're going to bust me? Get real. You just shot an innocent man on primetime TV. A roar from the crowd indicates something big is happening. J.Q. is coming outside. He's got the sniper in tow, using him as a human shield. The crowd behind the barricade is huge now, holding up signs like "Have a Heart," "Save Mike," and "John Q. Public." They scream encouragement with J.Q.'s every move. As he comes forward, police and SWAT teams train their rifles on him. J.Q. Grimes. Grimes! Behind the barricade, Frank Grimes stands with Monroe and Moody. MONROE Alright. GRIMES Alright, what? MONROE Let's go out there. See what he wants. GRIMES But I thought you said I was out. MONROE I stepped in shit, Frank. Is that what you want to hear, goddammit? Now quit breaking my stones. I need you to save my ass on this one. Frank Grimes smiles before grabbing a megaphone from one of the uniforms and stepping out from behind the barricade with Monroe and Moody. GRIMES Hold your fire. J.Q. looks around at the hundreds of weapons all pointing right at him. They're everywhere he turns. He sees Grimes approaches. J.Q. Look what I found. The crowd cheers support for their new hero. GRIMES John. J.Q. Who are these guys? Who the hell are you? Oh, I know who you are, the guys who tried to take me out. J.Q. indicates his bleeding shoulder. J.Q. (CONT'D) Almost. GRIMES This is Sergeant Moody and Police Chief Monroe. MONROE What are we doing, John? J.Q. You were going to call me back. I gave you your hostages and you were supposed to call me back. But no, you want me dead. GRIMES I don't want you dead. J.Q. No, you want to kill me. You want to kill me so bad you can taste it. GRIMES Nobody wants to kill you. J.Q. Nobody wants to kill me? (indicates the sniper) Who is this? The crowd voices their displeasure in a chorus of "boos." GRIMES That wasn't my call. I -- J.Q. I, I, I bullshit! You tried to kill me. You tried to kill me while I was talking to my boy! The crowd erupts. They're getting rowdy now. The cops are getting jumpy, their rifles trained, their trigger fingers ready. MONROE John, listen to me. Lieutenant Grimes had nothing to do with that. It was my call. J.Q. Don't lie to me. I don't need to be bullshitted by some lying flunky cops. GRIMES What are we, friends all of a sudden? All of a sudden, we owe you something? You pulled the gun. You're the one that took the hospital. What did you think would happen? You want truth Here's some truth. This is going to end up bad for you. There's only two ways out of here. Jail or dead. J.Q. hears the words and they sink in. He knows they're right. GRIMES (CONT'D) Look around you. Look at all of it. It's crazy. You don't want to do this. J.Q. I just want my life back. GRIMES I understand. It's hard to be a man these days. Hard to know what the right thing is. Put the gun down, John. It's all over. You got everything you asked for. Mike is on the list. Status one. J.Q. I don't believe you. GRIMES I give you my word. J.Q. Forgive me for being skeptical, Frank, but your word is shit! The crowd goes crazy, cheering and shouting out their encouragement. The faces are those of outrage and passion. Some even with tears streaming down their faces. J.Q. looks out the overwhelming display of support. GRIMES Hey, what are you doing? Stay with me, John. You think these people give a shit about you? They don't. You're just the cause of the moment. Believe me, in a couple of days, they'll be outraged about something else. Nobody cares, John. That's the real truth. Nobody cares. Only you. It's only you and me out here, and all these guns pointed at you. So, what do you want to do? It's your call. J.Q. I want my son. MOODY What? J.Q. Bring me my son. I want my son inside with me. MONROE Can't do it. J.Q. There's an operation that could save his life. I'm going to need some equipment but I've got two surgeons inside that are ready to go. MONROE You listen to me, you sonofabitch. You give this up right now, turn yourself in. And your son will have any and every means of assistance. If not, if you keep this up, this is going to be very bad for you. J.Q. Are you threatening me, Chief? Take your best shot. Oh, I forgot, you already did. No, we'll do this my way. You give me my boy, they do the surgery and then I give up. Nobody gets hurt and everyone goes home. Monroe studies J.Q. and considers. MONROE What do you think, Frank? GRIMES I say give it to him. He's not going to hurt his boy. Monroe takes his time making his decision. MOODY Sir, the object is to get hostages out, not to let more in. MONROE The boy is not a hostage. He's the man's son. Do it. INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MAGIC HOUR Mike's hospital bed flies down the hallway. Running alongside we see Denise, Payne and nurses holding medical equipment. MIKE Mom, where are we going? DENISE To see your father. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MAGIC HOUR The front doors burst open and Mike's bed is rolled onto the sidewalk. COPS run alongside like secret service agents, protecting Mike, pushing a path through the crowd. COPS Coming through. Let's go. Move it back, folks. The mob swarms around the speeding bed, trying to get a look at Mike, who considers the circus atmosphere surrounding him. As the bed hits the police barricade, the cops take over. DENISE Let me through. I'm his mother. But she is held back as Mike is ushered through. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MAGIC HOUR Mike's bed is rolled slowly to a stop outside the ER doors. The sniper is released and J.Q. stands guard as Mike is rolled in by Turner and Maguire, before locking the door behind them. MIKE Dad, where have you been? J.Q. Just waiting for you, buddy. Mike looks up to see Dr. Turner walking alongside. He looks up at him and smiles. Mike is wheeled into a Trauma room where the monitors quickly come to life. INT. MIKE'S TRAUMA ROOM - MAGIC HOUR J.Q. looks at Mike as the medical team assess his condition, just watching helplessly as the life drains out of his body. J.Q. How are you feeling, slugger? MIKE I'm okay. Tired. Beep. Beep. The monitors whisper faintly, irregularly, Turner steps in front of J.Q. DR. TURNER Out. J.Q. What? DR. TURNER I need some time to examine Mike and I don't need you getting in the way. It's crowded enough in here. J.Q. I'll stay in the corner. DR. TURNER I'm serious, John. Let me do my job. Turner ushers him out the door and closes it behind him. John looks up to find the hostages staring at him. Uncomfortable, he moves into a recovery room. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT J.Q., alone, notices the simple wooden cross hanging over the door. He stares at it a long time before kneeling, his arms resting on the bed. J.Q. Bless me, father. For I have sinned. It's been a long time, so forgive me if I'm a little rusty. I know you do things your own way. But I'm finding it hard to understand why you would want Mike to be so sick. INT. MIKE'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT Turner administers the meds and Mike's eyes glaze and roll back in his head. With all the drugs coursing through his system, Mike is really out of it now. But as Dr. Turner diligently attends to Mike, the boy considers him, the bright O.R. lights casting a halo around the doctor's head. MIKE Are you God? DR. TURNER (caught off-guard) Yeah, kid. Yeah, I am. Turner continues working, and as he turns his back to the boy, he hears the question that floors him. MIKE Where you been? INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT J.Q. I keep waiting for you to step in and help him. But you never do. And I don't understand. I don't understand and I don't forgive. So, help me, Father. Because I'm trying. I'm really trying. Dr. Turner appears at the doorway and sees John on his knees. DR. TURNER John? J.Q. looks up and Dr. Turner soberly shakes his head. The news isn't good. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - NIGHT Dr. Turner and John look through the glass at Mike resting peacefully. DR. TURNER Mike's blood pressure has dropped into the mid-forties. His atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens. It's thirty-five. If I put that LVAD into him, his heart will never be able to handle the extra strain. J.Q. But... DR. TURNER Not buts, John. Without a new heart, he's not going to make it. J.Q. is devastated. It takes a few moments to sink in. J.Q. Take mine. Turner doesn't get it. DR. TURNER What? J.Q. You heard me. Take my heart and put it in Mike. MITCH John, buddy, you're talking a little nutsy cukoo, here. DR. TURNER You can't be serious. J.Q. You think I'm just going to stand here and watch my son die? You bet I'm serious. Dead serious. DEBBY Wow. JULIE Oh my God. Lester tries to comprehend the nihilistic existentialism of it all. LESTER But that means you'll die, man. J.Q. calmly finishes Lester's thought. J.Q. And my sone will live. DR. KLEIN John, you can't do this. J.Q. It's the only way. DR. KLEIN No, you don't understand. You physically can't do it. J.Q. Why not? I kill myself. You cut me open and take my heart. It's perfect. LESTER The boy crazy. MITCH Nutsy cuckoo, I'm telling you. DR. KLEIN We just can't remove your heart and put it into Mike's body. DR. TURNER There's too many unknowns. Matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated. There's several critical tests that have to be taken. J.Q. Like what? DR. TURNER Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements. If both blood tissues aren't compatible, there's a very high likelihood of rejection. J.Q. Come on, Doc. I know all about compatibility. We've been tested up the wazoo. Mike and I are both B-Positive. Our tissues are a match. And his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit. You know damn well we're compatible. DR. TURNER No, we don't. You're an adult. Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike. J.Q. I'll take that chance. It's better than letting him die. DR. TURNER Out of the question. Too risky. J.Q. I'm telling you, he'll make it. DR. TURNER Can't do it, John. J.Q. You're telling me that if I'm laying dead on the floor, you wouldn't take my heart and put it in my kid to save his life? You'd let two people die instead of one because of a technicality? JULIE I think what John's trying to do is right. DEBBY Me, too. I think it's very brave. MAGUIRE Yeah, it's all very noble and brave. But what do you think Mike would want? Or your wife? J.Q. Mike is too young to know what's good for him. I'm his father. It's my job to protect him, and Denise would do the same thing if she was in my place. SECURITY GUARD Are you saying Mike's life is more important than yours? MITCH Or that it's okay that Mike grows up without a father? MAGUIRE You can have more children, John. LESTER What happened to Mike is bad, man. It's the worst. It ain't fair, but you can't kill yourself. Sometimes you've just got to let go and let God take care of it. You've got to accept it. J.Q. Accept what? DR. TURNER That Mike's going to die. J.Q. No. I don't accept it. I reject it out of hand. John moves over to Dr. Turner to plea his case. J.Q. (CONT'D) I know you only think of Mike as a patient, but he's a great kid. Really. He's like magic, you know? He loves bodybuilding. You believe that? And he's funny. You'd like him, Doc. You'd really like him, if you knew him. DR. TURNER I do like him. J.Q. Please. You've got to help him. I'm begging you. If you ever do anything outside the rules, do this. Take a chance, please. DR. TURNER I'd like to. I really would. But what you're asking crosses the line. It's completely unethical. J.Q. I've crossed the line? No, you've crossed the line. The whole system has crossed the line. J.Q. paces around the room, his hand on his weapon, his mood very dark and threatening. J.Q. (CONT'D) I don't think you understand. I'm not letting him die. Haven't you figured that out by now? I don't care what I have to do. DR. TURNER So, what, you're going to kill me if I don't operate. J.Q. No. I'm going to kill myself. J.Q. puts the gun to his temple. J.Q. (CONT'D) And we'll just see what happens. LESTER Aw, man, this is messed up. J.Q. We all know how this works, people. In order for Mike to live, someone has to die. I'm the father. It might as well be me. J.Q. and Turner's eyes meet. Turner doesn't speak for a long moment. DR. TURNER Alright. MITCH Alright, what? DR. TURNER I'll do it. If that's what you want. MITCH Wait a minute. Are you serious? The room goes quiet. DR. TURNER Once he's dead. Why not? Dr. Klein moves to Dr. Turner. DR. KLEIN You're the finest surgeon I've ever known. You can't just throw your entire career for this man. MITCH Yeah, you're not God. It's not up to you to decide who lives and dies. J.Q. Aw, come on, Mitch. We're all going to die. MAGUIRE Not for nothing, Doctor. But if you do this, you're finished. DR. TURNER So, what are they going to do? Sue me? Disbar me? Evict me from the country club? DR. KLEIN Raymond, you're under a lot of stress. You're not yourself. DR. TURNER Yeah, well, what is myself? Because right now, I really don't know. Let's see -- He takes his Patek Phillipe watch off and throws it at the wall, smashing it. DR. TURNER (CONT'D) I run six miles a day, drive around in my little black Porsche and date girls thirty years younger than me. Is the picture clear now? I like twelve hundred dollar shoes and I've always got a great tan. And here's the best part. Everybody kisses my ass and acts as if that's the way doctors are supposed to be, that's the reward. Reward for what? What I am is a plumber. I connect valves to tubes and tubes to valves. That's what I do. But back in that room with your son, I got a very short glimpse of my soul. And let me tell you, it's been long lost. MAGUIRE But... DR. TURNER This is still a hospital. There's a sick kid in there and I'm his doctor. And if there's a heart available, I'll be damned if I'm going to let it go to waste. The room is stunned. EXT. MONTANA HOSPITAL - ROOF - NIGHT A medivac chopper swoops down, lands on the big white cross on the helipad tarmac. The doors fly open. A medical team quickly disembarks, lifts out a stretcher with a beautiful woman's body and runs across the roof into the hospital. INT. MONTANA HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT The stretcher is rushed into the O.R. and the body is placed on the surgical table. A MEDICAL TRANSPLANT TEAM is waiting, ready. They take the body, prep for organ harvesting. INT. MONTANA HOSPITAL - OFFICE - NIGHT In another room, an UNOS OFFICIAL is notified of the beautiful woman's arrival. UNOS OFFICIAL She's here? He gets up and is on the move, securing his wireless headset and dialing. INT. MONTANA HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT The UNOS Official moves into the OR. Everything the transplant people tell him, he repeats into the phone. MEDICAL TRANSPLANT PERSON #1 Female. Donor. Thirty-three years old. Five foot seven. Liver, kidneys, usable. UNOS OFFICIAL Lungs? MEDICAL TRANSPLANT PERSON #2 Okay. UNOS OFFICIAL Heart? MEDICAL TRANSPLANT PERSON #2 Heart is good. UNOS OFFICIAL Type? The transplant team are busy. UNOS OFFICIAL (CONT'D) Come on. Blood type? MEDICAL TRANSPLANT PERSON #1 (checks bracelet) B-positive. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT The TVs are now off. J.Q. looks out the window at the evergrowing police build-up. There's an upbeat bound in his step, a sense of relief with the finality of the decision he's made. J.Q. Come on, guys. Let's hurry it up. They could bust in here any minute. SECURITY GUARD This was your plan all along, wasn't it? J.Q. Last resort. You think I wanted it to turn out like this? J.Q. pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolds it. J.Q. (CONT'D) This is my will. I'm leaving my heart to my son. He holds up a pen. J.Q. (CONT'D) I need two witnesses. Don't everybody jump at once. LESTER I ain't signing your death warrant. No way. J.Q. Come on, people. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we all go home. JULIE I'll sign. SECURITY GUARD Me, too. They do. SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D) You know something, man? You're alright. J.Q. Sure am. Only one thing can stop me now. SECURITY GUARD What's that. J.Q. Mitch here being B-positive. MITCH No, sir. Type-O.Ê Swear to God. For a moment the mood is light. J.Q. looks around the room at Maguire, Debby, Mitch, Julie, Lester, and the security guard. Debby can't stop crying again. J.Q. Hey, you. MITCH Yeah. J.Q. Do yourself a favor. Start doing the right thing, huh? Life's too short. You had a good woman there. You're too smart to be so dumb. J.Q. looks around the room before he leaves. J.Q. (CONT'D) Alright, people. See you in the funny papers. INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT The daisy wheel buzzes, pounding letters onto the print page. Mike Archibald, Hope Memorial Hospital, age 9, 85 pounds. Blood type: B-positive. MATCH. PULL BACK TO REVEAL A man sitting alone in front of the computer. He rips the copy from the printer, lays it into the fax machine and dials. A piercing beep. The paper gets sucked away. INT. PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - NIGHT A fax machine chirps in the quiet PICU. Reggie picks up the fax, and as he reads, a look of disbelief. REGGIE Oh, my sweet Jesus. Paper in hand, he sprints out of the ward and down the corridor. INT. MIKE'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT John enters to find Dr. Klein checking Mike's vitals. The heart monitor reads 30. J.Q. Can I have a word with him? Dr. Klein exits and J.Q. moves to Mike and gently wakes him up. MIKE Hi, Dad. You find me a heart? J.Q. Yeah, kid. We got you one. Look like you've got a guardian angel. Mike smiles and tries to go back to sleep. J.Q. (CONT'D) Try to stay awake for a minute, will you? I just need to tell you a few things. I want you always to listen to your mother. Because she's your best friend and family is important. He's all over the place, searching for the right words. J.Q. (CONT'D) And girls? You're too young for them now, but when the time comes, treat them like princesses because that's what they are. And if you say you'll do something, do it, because your world should be your bond. And if you have a chance to make money, go for it, even if it means selling out once in a while. Don't be a knucklehead like your father. Everything's so much easier with money. He's stumbling, trying to cram a lifetime of advice into five minutes. J.Q. (CONT'D) Don't smoke. And try to be kind. But if someone chooses you, be a man and stand up for yourself. And don't get caught up in the bad things, there's too many great things out there. J.Q. just sits there, the tears running down his face, not knowing what to say. J.Q. (CONT'D) Mike? Mike's eyes open. MIKE Yeah, Dad? J.Q. See you later, buddy. Mike closes his eyes before opening and closing his little hand. Bye bye. INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - NIGHT INTERCUT Reggie races through the hospital, weaving in and out of ambulatory and pedestrian traffic. In his hand, the all important fax. INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT Maguire, Klein and Turner speak in hushed tones as J.Q. reenters. When they see him, they immediately go quiet. J.Q.'s eyes are glassy, a look of finality on his face. J.Q. Let's do it. Maguire gathers fresh, clean towels and makes a pack for the back of J.Q.'s head. J.Q. sits on the exam table, takes the Baretta and pops the clip. He then takes a single bullet from his pocket, feeds the clip and chambers the round. MAGUIRE Wait a minute. This gun was empty the whole time? J.Q. Aw, I'm all talk. I would never hurt any of you. Only person I ever considered killing was me. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT Reggie flies out the main entrance and into the crowd, pushing through the sea of humanity until he reaches Payne, Grimes and Monroe. REGGIE Miss Payne! You're not going to believe this! We've got a match. PAYNE Are you sure? Payne studies the fax. REGGIE B-positive. Michael William Archibald. The only status one in the whole country. The heart is ours. INSERT FAX It's official. The heart is on the way. PAYNE Well, I'll be damned. GRIMES You really put the kid on the list? PAYNE I may be a lot of things, Lieutenant, but I am not a liar. INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT J.Q. readies himself before laying back on the roll of towels. DR. TURNER John. Stop. I changed my mind. I won't do this. J.Q. regards Turner with positive affection. J.Q. You're a good man, Doc. I know you'll do the right thing. J.Q. lifts the gun to his head. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT Reggie, Grimes, Payne and Monroe run over to Denise. GRIMES Mrs. Archibald? I have some very, very good news. INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT The moment has come. Everyone's face wears the intensity of it. John holds the gun up, his hand trembling. CLICK! Nothing happens. J.Q. Sorry. Safety's on. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT Denise reads the fax. DENISE Is this for real? REGGIE You bet. The Lear Jet just landed at O'Hare. The helicopter will be here in fifteen minutes. Grimes offers his walkie-talkie to Denise. GRIMES You want to do the honors? DENISE (into walkie-talkie) John? It's me, baby. Are you there? INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT DENISE (O.S.) John, honey? Pick up. J.Q. hears Denise's voice squawking over the walkie-talkie. SNAP. He shuts it off. Takes a deep breath. Flips the safety off and puts the gun to his head for the final time. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT Denise keeps triggering the walkie-talkie. DENISE John? John? Oh, no. Desperate, she grabs the list and starts running towards the ER entrance. INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE ON J.Q.'s GUN Moves closer to the temple til it touches. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT Denise breaks through the police barricade. INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT CLOSER ON TRIGGER as John's finger pulls it tighter. BLAM! EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - E.R. ENTRANCE - NIGHT BLAM! The sound is revealed. Not a bullet. It's Denise slapping the list up against the glass windows of the ER. DENISE John! It's a miracle! They found a heart! It's a miracle!!! EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT The crowd points and stares as a white medivac helicopter descends from the sky, lights flashing and lands on the roof. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Tuck Lampley, hand over his ear, shouting above the noise to bring us more exclusive coverage. LAMPLEY The heart is here. Repeat. The heart for little Mike Archibald has arrived. What an unbelievable ending to this incredible, tumultuous day. A roar from the crowd is heard as the entrance to the ER is unlocked and the front door opens. Mitch and Debby are the first to emerge. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) Oh my goodness, here we go. The first of the hostages are being released. Yes, they're coming out. There's one, two. They appear to be unharmed. But certainly exhausted from what must've been an excruciating ordeal. Julie and the security guard are next. And are quickly ushered away to support vehicles. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) More, now. And there he is. John Q. is coming out. J.Q., in baseball hat and windbreaker, emerges from the hospital. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) The suspect's hands are up. He appears to be surrendering. The police are all around him now. Pointing their weapons and shouting commands. J.Q. puts his hands behind his head, turns around, kneels and then lays face down on the pavement. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) And they've got him. The police have subdued him. The handcuffs are on, and it's over. It's all over. The crowd voices their disapproval with the rough way J.Q. is being apprehended. They cheer their support as he is escorted to a police car. LAMPLEY (CONT'D) If pictures speak a thousand words, well, I'd say these images speak volumes. And now as the bloody stand off comes to an end, we remind you that Channel 8 was here first and has brought you live, moment-to-moment, all-day coverage of "Crisis at Hope Memorial.' Frank Grimes takes in the whole scene. But as he glances at the suspect, a funny look comes across his face. Wait a sec - INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - NIGHT Mike's gurney flies through the hospital corridors. Running alongside are Turner, Klein, Maguire and Denise. As well as teams of MEDICAL PERSONNEL and a man in green surgical scrubs. As they pass a police checkpoint, we notice the identity of the man in the green scrubs. It's J.Q. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT As J.Q. is pushed into the car, Grimes sees his real identity. It's Lester, dressed in J.Q.'s windbreaker, collar up, baseball cap pulled way down over his eyes. Grimes shakes his head. Top notch policework. Incredulous, he turns and takes the long walk to the hospital. INT. OPERATING ROOM - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY - NIGHT Dr. Turner and the team work with quiet precision as Mike lays on the operating table, his chest wide open. Behind the partition glass, J.Q. and Denise hold on to each other for support as they look on. A figure in a rumpled suit settles in next to them and watches. It's Grimes. GRIMES It's time, John. J.Q. turns, knows it's over. J.Q. Can you give me a second, Frank? I just need to see this thing through. GRIMES Sure. Put these on for me, will you? Grimes hands J.Q. a pair of handcuffs. John puts them on and the three watch the surgery. The replacement heart is taken out of its container and placed into Mike's chest. But then, something suddenly is wrong. Mike's vital signs start giving out. The gauges dropping at once. It's bad. NURSE #1 Blood pressure seventy over thirty-two. NURSE #2 Acute respiratory distress. NURSE #1 He's fibrillating. MAGUIRE I don't have a pulse. John and Denise look on, helpless. Dr. Turner barks out commands as the team scrambles to remedy the critical situation. DR. KLEIN He's going. DR. TURNER No! Come on, goddammit! I'm not losing this boy! Nut now the long familiar tone of the EKG is heard. FLATLINE. VIDEO IMAGES FILL THE SCREEN Various news related programming. "Crossfire," "Face The Nation," CNBC, COURT TV and "Larry King Live." Clips dissolve one into the other. VIDEO CLIP #1 NEWS REPORTER #1 ...cannot let this man free. It sends the wrong message. NEWS REPORTER #2 I agree. Although he's paid a heavy price, he took matters into his own hands... VIDEO CLIP #2 NEWS REPORTER #3 Maybe it's the wake up call this country needs... VIDEO CLIP #3 NEWS REPORTER #4 ...socialized medicine in England has worked. NEWS REPORTER #5 Sure, to a point. Except when it's their life on the line, the Dutch, the English and everyone else go to their private doctors or come to America because we have the best technology. That is if they can afford it. VIDEO CLIP #4 NEWS REPORTER #6 I think the decision we see today will tell us a lot about this country. VIDEO CLIP #5 NEWS REPORTER #7 The long awaited verdict is expected today in the trial of John Quincy Archibald, where the jury has been deliberating... INT. COURTROOM - DAY SUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATER CLOSE ON A gavel pounding down. The black-robed JUDGE silences the crowd. The courtroom is standing room only. Packed with cops, TV cameras, reporters, etc. We see Denise next to a grim-faced Jimmy and Gina Palumbo. As the jury flies into the jury box, the people take their seats. The bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the FOREMAN. JUDGE Has the jury reached a verdict? The foreman stands, faces the judge. JURY FORMAN We have, Your Honor. JUDGE The defendant will please rise. AT THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE J.Q. Archibald gets up and faces the judge. His attorney, a P.D., by his side. Standing next to Denise, we REVEAL MIKE - he looks healthy and rosy-cheeked. He grabs his mother's hand with anticipation. JUDGE (CONT'D) The jury foreman will now read the verdict. JURY FORMAN As to count one, Assault with a deadly weapon, we find the defendant, John Quincy Archibald, not guilty. The courtroom explodes in cheers. In the crowd, we see familiar faces: Debby, Dr. Turner, and Dr. Klein. Behind them, Maguire. JURY FORMAN (CONT'D) On count two, Armed Criminal Action. Not guilty. The crowd again roars its approval. Steve and Miriam watch from the gallery, holding a baby girl. Even Rebecca Payne cracks a smile. JURY FORMAN (CONT'D) On the final count, False Imprisonment, we find the defendant, guilty. The crowd erupts in protest. The media rush out to file their stories. DENISE No! JUDGE Quiet! Sentencing will be one week from today. J.Q. stares straight ahead and takes a breath. After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike. PUBLIC DEFENDER He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon. J.Q. leans over to talk to his son. J.Q. You alright? Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears. J.Q. (CONT'D) It's okay, slugger. I'll be home soon. If you need anything, ask your mother. And Jimmy and Gina will be around. MIKE Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it. J.Q. embraces his boy and moves over to Denise. DENISE A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that. A hand taps him on the shoulder. J.Q. looks up. Sees Grimes. GRIMES Time to go, John. DENISE John? I'm proud of you. J.Q. smiles and Grimes starts to lead him away. JIMMY Give 'em hell, Johnny. Don't worry about nothing. MIKE Bye, Dad. J.Q. Not goodbye. Remember? See you later. EXT. COURTROOM - MORNING An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps. They cheer their support as J.Q. emerges. Grimes steers J.Q. out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in J.Q.'s face. They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics. J.Q., uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment. He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice. VOICE IN CROWD Hey, John. Good luck, man. J.Q. recognizes the voice, turns and sees LESTER. Both smile to each other as J.Q. is pushed further through when -- REPORTER John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down? J.Q. (quietly) No. It's a wonderful country. REPORTER I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that? Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera. GRIMES He said, "America is the greatest goddamn country in the world." Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail. They push past the barricades and into the street. MEDIA John Q.! John Q.! GRIMES Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John. J.Q. Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days. They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door. J.Q. climbs inside. He looks up to see the CROWD, in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at J.Q. J.Q. (CONT'D) This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people. GRIMES What can I tell you? You're their hero. J.Q. I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy. GRIMES Yeah, right. Grimes slams the door. The "cherry" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people. INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS On the street, J.Q. sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention. Mike is saying something. J.Q. turns to look closer and finally he gets it: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Mike's lips say "Thank you." INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS John winks at his boy. EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Mike makes a muscle. INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS John smiles, and the car picks up speed. EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS The cop car pulls away. Away from the courtroom. The circus. Finally disappearing from view and we -- FADE TO BLACK. THE END

          Climate. Nations. Borders. All

          Civilization threatened to collapse.
          And then... a solution was found.
          The crumbling, teetering legal

          You want a weapon, I can get you
          something nice. But if you touch

          Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model
          Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.
          The difference lies in two areas:
          The computer chip and the ammunition
          coding. Like the Model one, the
          computer chip recognizes the
          thumbcode of all Judges. Judges
          may use each other's firearms; but
          a suspect dare not use a Judge's
          .weapon against "a Judge.

          he holds his uniform, Lawgiver, and badge in a ceremonial

          Fargo, grizzled, weary; the girl, fresh, tearful. Like so many,

           here?

          Dredd only worships the Law. And
          he'd blow you away the minute he
          found out just how much you're
          pissing on it. Trust me: It's
          better this way. Let him see what
          it's like to freeze his ass off in

          I to be me! After all...
          He moves closer to Griffin, smiles.

          .Dredd and I have so much in
          common. Why not this?
          Griffin looks at him, decides to drop the subject.

                         GRIFFIN
          There's a lot of work to be done.

                         RICO
          Yes. The Janus lab -

                         GRIFFIN
          You'll see it soon enough. In the
          meantime... I want chaos, Rico.
          That block war was just the
          beginning. Now I want fear racing
          through every street... terror in
          every quad... panic in every block.
          Until those miserable rezzies think
          even their Judges can't save them.
          That's when the Council will turn
          to me... and to Janus.
          Rico moves towards the door. Pauses.

                         RICO
          Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can
          handle that. After all...
          (slight.smile)
          Look how quickly I brought fear in
          here.

               EXT. - NIGHT

               It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary 
               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below 
               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes 
               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks 
               strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... 
               Closer... Closer...

               Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench 
               it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover 
               that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with 
               every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!* 
               Lightning obliterates the frame.

               (* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights, 
               photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout 
               the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)

               CITY STREET EXT. NIGHT

               We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of 
               an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. 
               Flash!!

               Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 
               70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting 
               image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright 
               red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.

               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT

               FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat 
               up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as 
               he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.

               The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in 
               a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs 
               down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She 
               seems nervous... scared even.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         Thanks.

               As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has 
               been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and 
               stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to 
               a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts 
               his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing 
               against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift 
               into drive.

               Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls 
               out into the night.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! 
               Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly 
               against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN 
               KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, 
               and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight 
               black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical 
               cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one 
               hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into 
               the tape recorder.

                                     BRIAN
                         Her father worked the night shift 
                         here. Most nights he'd bring her 
                         with him.
                              (pause)
                         She was eleven years old.

               His flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes 
               flash photo.

               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

               Emerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands 
               that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket 
               clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of 
               the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up 
               against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal 
               the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, 
               revealing another room.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is it. This is the where he'd 
                         take her whenever he had the urge to 
                         molest her.

               The flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The 
               warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.

                                     BRIAN
                         Of course! Nobody would have heard 
                         her cries over the noise of the 
                         machines.

               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT

               A male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's 
               front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the 
               constant sheet of rain beyond.

                                     DRIVER
                         Damn! This defroster never works...

               The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. 
               He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. 
               The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         ...Mmm... feels good.

               She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches 
               her. His eyes linger on her body.

                                     DRIVER
                         Have a problem with your car?

               She pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a 
               nervous smile.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         No.

                         My problem's with men.

               He throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Brian's flashlight moves around the room.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is where she murdered her first 
                         victim. They found his body over in 
                         the corner, shot through the head.

               The flashlight continues to search through the darkness.

                                     BRIAN
                         They found her second victim over 
                         there.

               Another flash!!!!!

               INT. 70'S CHEVY

               Very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper 
               is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         Okay if I smoke?

                         ...sure.

               The driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a 
               soggy pack of matches. She looks at them... I look to the 
               driver.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         My matches are all wet. You got a 
                         lighter?

                         Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my 
                         wife's car. Ah... there it is.

               He pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. Out of the corner 
               of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse. 
               And stay there. She stares at the car lighter and... waits. 
               The driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.

                              (beat)
                         Imagine the anger and hatred she 
                         must have felt returning to this 
                         place. Did she use that to help her 
                         pull the trigger?

               Carrie snaps another shot. Flash!! The blinding flash 
               illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured 
               remains of the ceiling.

                                     CARRIE
                         Shhhhhhhhh.

               Brian stops talking. Carrie scans the darkness. From the 
               quiet...

               A Thunderous Roar!!

               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT

               A Blinding Flash!!

               As... a semi-trailer crosses paths with the 70'S CHEVY.

               Close on the girl. An intent expression on her face as she 
               watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. His 
               hand reaches deeper into her purse. The Driver tenses as he 
               sees this. Suddenly...

               POP!! The lighter ejects.

               The Driver reaches for the dash. The girl hurriedly lifts 
               something out from inside the bag. The Driver yanks the 
               lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE

               Brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the 
               rafters and catwalks. Scanning... Listening... Brian and 
               Carrie glance tentatively at each other... Then slowly Carrie 
               lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing 
               into the rafters. Carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant 
               Flash!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Flash! Out of the inky black... The glistening wet rock 
               emerges, hurtling downwards... Tumbling end over end through 
               the night rain...

               INT. 70'S CHEVY

               The girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. She 
               looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling 
               slightly.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         What's the matter?

                                     DRIVER
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...nothing.

               The girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and 
               pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips.

               When... in a THUNDEROUS CRASH!! The glistening wet rock comes 
               smashing through their windshield!!!!

               EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

               The CHEVY brakes... Skids across the rain-slicked pavement 
               and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood.

               ANOTHER ANGLE: CLOSER

               The CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the fractured front end of the 
               overturned CHEVY. The twisted hunk of metal hisses... 
               steams... groans. The front tire spins lazily to a halt on 
               its mangled axle.

               IN THE BACKGROUND - HIGH OVERHEAD

               We see a man standing on a highway overpass. He's leaning on 
               the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.

               CLOSER

               EARLY GRAYCE, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black 
               hair, stands by the railing. Rain streaks down his 
               expressionless face. He dropped the rock.

               EARLY'S POV - THE 70'S CHEVY

               Lying in the deserted highway. The Driver crawls out covered 
               with blood. Still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette 
               lighter. Its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint 
               glow.

               ANGLE: CLOSER ON EARLY

               Calmly looking down with no pity. Even closer... Water running 
               down his face. Closer yet... On his eye... And right into 
               the dilated pupil.

               As we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel 
               filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping 
               of powerful machinery.

               FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BLACKNESS

               The distant echo of a Woman's voice.

                                     KIM (O.S.)
                         Are you dead or alive?

               INT. APARTMENT - BRIAN'S EAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Still hearing the whine from some tremendous dynamo, we emerge 
               from the inside of BRIAN'S RIGHT EARDRUM, pulling back far 
               enough to see his face.

                                     KIM (O.S.)
                         Brian?

               Brian is distracted, distant, not paying attention to the 
               game of "Twenty Questions" that he is playing.

                                     BRIAN
                         Dead.

                                     KIM (O.S.)
                              (sarcastic)
                         Obviously!

               NEW ANGLE

               A small party in progress. Graduate student types, smoking, 
               drinking. The usual. Carrie and Brian stand out in this group, 
               their look is more stylized, their attitude less complacent. 
               Carrie, in particular, looks restless.

                                     CARL
                         Man or woman?

                                     BRIAN
                         Man.

               Carrie tunes in and pays attention to the game.

                         Real.

                         Ted Bundy.

               Brian's eyes dart to Carrie. The look on his face tells 
               everyone she nailed it. Brian gets up to get another drink. 
               Several people laugh, amazed that Carrie knows Brian so well.

                                     CLAUDIA
                         What a guess!

                                     CARL
                         Doesn't count, she's disqualified.

                                     CARRIE
                         Why?

                                     CARL
                         Because you've been living with him, 
                         and his thesis for the last year and 
                         a half.
                              (beat)
                         He's probably been researching Ted 
                         Bundy all week.

                                     PETER
                         Carl, you are the world's worst loser!

               Carl looks over to Carrie. She gives him the finger and a 
               cheeky smile.

               CAROL, sitting next to Carrie, asks...

                                     CAROL
                         Any word from that gallery?

                                     CARRIE
                         Not yet.

                                     CAROL
                         Nervous?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget 
                         these are the people who banned the 
                         Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, 
                         California's loaded with galleries.

                                     CAROL
                              (nods toward Brian)
                         You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed 
                         to leave?

               Carrie watches Brian disappear into another room.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Soon as he finishes his thesis.

                                     CAROL
                         Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his 
                         for over three years now.

               Carrie lights a cigarette. Her frustration is showing.

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end 
                         of the summer, then I'm outta here.

               She gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded 
               room. Carol follows.

                                     CAROL
                         I'm sorry, but I just can't see you 
                         veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.

                                     CARRIE
                         Oh, I don't know... I think that 
                         once I dye my hair blonde, buy a 
                         string bikini and cultivate that 
                         tan... I could be veggin' out with 
                         the best of 'em...

                         Like fer shurr!

               Carrie and Carol share a strained laugh.

               INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - FEW MOMENTS LATER

               The room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise -- 
               "shop talk," banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we 
               find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of 
               making a blender of margaritas.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm talking about the mind and 
                         culpability of a serial killer. 
                         Someone who has no ability to 
                         distinguish between right and wrong 
                         should not be imprisoned, let alone 
                         executed.

               Eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as Brian pours in the 
               booze.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay 
                         it all at the altar of misfiring 
                         synapses, amok biochemicals and 
                         horrendous childhoods.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, it's a fact, most of these 
                         people suffer from a severe chemical 
                         brain imbalance.
                              (beat)
                         That enough Tequila?

                                     ERIC
                         Probably not...

               Brian pours in the rest of the bottle.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Eric)
                         The answer is research and treatment 
                         under hospital supervised conditions, 
                         not the electric chair!

               Eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. PETER overhears 
               them on his way to the refrigerator.

                                     PETER
                         Yeah, until it's your mother's head 
                         they find in the refrigerator.

               He pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers. 
               Carrie steps up behind Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Executing the killer wouldn't bring 
                         my mother back.

                                     CARRIE
                         Thank god!

               Brian turns to see Carrie now behind him. She wraps her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     BRIAN
                              (sarcastic to Carrie)
                         Ha, ha.

                                     ERIC
                         Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel 
                         better, wouldn't it?

                                     BRIAN
                         No, it wouldn't make me feel better.

               Peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator.

                                     PETER
                         ...Looking for this?

               Eric takes the triple sec from Peter and pours some in the 
               blender. He turns it on. It whines.

                                     CARRIE
                              (to Brian)

                         "tweed" talk about his dissertation, 
                         I'm going to throw up.

                                     ERIC
                              (to Brian)
                         Label it anyway you want, the bottom 
                         line is these people are evil, plain 
                         and simple.

                              (continuing with Eric)
                         Okay, now you want to talk about 
                         good versus evil? Well then let's 
                         start with Adam and Eve and the snake.

               EXT. LUCKY STREET GRILL

               A relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain 
               has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of 
               shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks 
               into the diner.

               The place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain, 
               walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the 
               kitchen.

                                     EARLY
                         Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.

                                     WAITRESS (O.S.)
                         ...Be right there.

               The only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter 
               nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a 
               rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop 
               juke box.

               OLD MAN'S POV

               Out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete 
               block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (from beneath his 
                              shadowy brim...)
                         The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a 
                         man's body. Seven heads and seven 
                         tails.

               Early gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the 
               waitress...

                                     EARLY
                         Make that to go.

               Early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He 
               leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS 
               it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands 
               on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE!

               EARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one 
               stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a 
               glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat.

               IN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA

               The waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front 
               door slams shut!

               FRONT DINING AREA

               The waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old 
               Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes 
               her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. 
               She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of 
               something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, 
               she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its 
               window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads 
               "OPEN."

               AT THE FRONT DOOR

               She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously 
               out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door 
               and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her 
               way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly 
               she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked 
               booths.

               HER POV

               Sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are 
               a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier 
               by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously 
               about the interior. No one in sight.

               AT THE BOOTH

               She reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks 
               at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly 
               out of the quiet... a voice.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Size 6.

               The Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! 
               Early leans out from behind the highback partition.

                                     EARLY
                         That's right ain't it, size 6?

               The Waitress... smiles, nods shyly.

                                     EARLY
                         Happy birthday Adele.

                                     ADELE
                         Early, you are so sweet.

               This is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and 
               Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss, 
               then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to 
               try on her new shoes.

                                     ADELE
                         I feel kind of like the wizard of 
                         oz, you know when she gets the red 
                         shoes.

                                     EARLY
                         Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me 
                         that chili there.

               She passes the bag to Early. He digs in. Between bites, he 
               glances over to Adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the 
               new shoes.

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

               A door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. Brian 
               and Carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party.

               Their apartment is in an old converted industrial building 
               in a funky low rent part of town.

               Brian walks ahead, Carrie trails behind him, peeling off her 
               clothes. She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Tonight turned out to be pretty 
                         interesting.

                                     CARRIE
                         The party?

               She grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.

                                     BRIAN
                         The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

                                     CARRIE
                         It was definitely the high point of 
                         the evening.

               Carrie's dress falls to the floor.

                                     BRIAN
                              (getting excited)
                         Just being there where it really 
                         happened. It was different... more 
                         visceral.

                                     CARRIE
                         Mmm... I love it when you talk like 
                         that.

               Brian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... Carrie 
               has transformed. She has stripped down to her black bra and 
               panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. 
               A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie. 
               She looks great.

               OMITTED

               Carrie pushes Brian back onto the bed.

               OMITTED

               Carrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly 
               starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING

               A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.

               INT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING

               Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past 
               the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his 
               right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen 
               half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of 
               Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she 
               sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with 
               water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.

               OMITTED

                                     ADELE
                         You thirsty Lucy?

               OMITTED

               She waters her small cactus (Lucy).

                                     ADELE
                         Bet that feels good, don't it?

               NEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR

               Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by 
               a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it 
               up.

                                     ADELE
                         Now if that ain't Momma's little 
                         angel.

               Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young 
               Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about 
               ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped 
               over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt 
               dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned 
               to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to 
               the news.

               NEW ANGLE ON EARLY

               A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his 
               eyes.

               The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.

                                     NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                         ...two more victims last night, when 
                         a twenty pound rock smashed through 
                         the windshield of their car...

               CLOSER - EARLY'S FACE

               Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off 
               one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops 
               open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The 
               pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The 
               newscaster's voice continues to amplify...

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         This was the third such attack in 
                         the past month and while an extensive 
                         police operation is underway... no 
                         arrests have yet been made.

               The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes 
               his eyes and drifts back to sleep.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING

               Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He 
               looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless 
               junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway 
               of the trailer in her bathrobe.

                                     ADELE
                         Early...

               She glances around to make certain that no one's looking, 
               then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.

                                     ADELE
                         Have a good one.

               Early smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then, 
               remembers...

                                     ADELE
                         Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr. 
                         Diebold was by again yesterday.

               Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold 
               lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.

                                     ADELE
                         He said, if he ain't got the rest of 
                         his money by the end of the month, 
                         he's gonna "kick us the...
                              (spells the word fuck 
                              to avoid saying it)
                         F-U-C-K outta here."

               Early works his jaw, thinking.

                                     EARLY
                         He said that, huh? Cursed in front 
                         of you?

               Adele nods.

                                     ADELE
                         You gonna talk to him?

               Early gets in his car.

                                     EARLY
                         If he comes back, don't answer the 
                         door.

               Early revs the raspy engine.

                                     ADELE
                         Suppose he hears me inside?

               Adele's words are unheard as Early pulls away flinging his 
               beer bottle at a couple of chained PITBULLS in Diebold's 
               front yard.

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - AFTERNOON

               Brian enters the darkened loft interior.

                                     BRIAN
                         I picked up some Chinese. Did you 
                         hear from the gallery?

               Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series 
               of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are 
               slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature 
               and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs 
               address the sexual collision of opposites. "What if's." The 
               subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly 
               unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.

                                     BRIAN
                              (tentative)
                         You got your slides back.

               From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice. 
               He drifts toward the couch.

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic... 
                         not suitable for mass consumption... 
                         one of those... I forget. Who cares.

               Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down. 
               She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She 
               continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on, 
               it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of 
               something 90 proof.

                                     CARRIE
                         Christ Brian I'm dying here... you 
                         are too, you just don't know it yet. 
                         You're too busy working on that damned 
                         thesis... And, thing is... when you 
                         finally do finish it, it's just gonna 
                         get filed away on some shelf at the 
                         University Library... then what?

               Brian can see she's upset. Drowsy from the booze. He just 
               watches her. Listens. Her words linger in his head.

                                     CARRIE
                              (continues)
                         I thought you wanted to be a writer.

                                     BRIAN
                              (quietly)
                         ...I do.

                                     CARRIE
                         Then you can write anywhere. Let's 
                         get out of here, while we still can.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie, come on... we can leave 
                         anytime we...

                                     CARRIE
                         No we can't. We can never leave once 
                         you start talking about tenure... 
                         and vacation pay... and parking 
                         privileges and... oh shit! let's 
                         just go to California now, right 
                         now, before it's too late.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...just like that?

                                     CARRIE
                         Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... 
                         point it West... stop when we hit 
                         the fucking ocean.

               The bold graphic sexual photographs of Carrie's continue to 
               accentuate her comments.

                                     CARRIE
                         That's half the kick anyway. Doing 
                         something you've never done before. 
                         Experiencing something... different. 
                         Something... unpredictable.

               Brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. He picks it 
               up. Opens it. Inside, he finds the photographs Carrie took 
               at the warehouse. Interested, he shuffles through them. He 
               becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...These are great.

               He glances over to Carrie... she's fallen asleep. He reaches 
               over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE AFTERNOON

               Early's Grand Prix has a head of steam up as it tears across 
               the drive and hangs a hard right into his parking space next 
               to the trailer. Suddenly, Early hits the brakes hard! Another 
               car is parked there.

               INT. EARLY'S TRAILER

               Early spills through the doorway.

                                     EARLY
                         Adele, who's car's that out...

               Early spots his PAROLE OFFICER standing in the bedroom area 
               snooping around. He has a prosthetic hand which he uses to 
               search through Early's things.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         She's not here.

               The Parole Officer hiccups throughout the scene.

                                     EARLY
                         What are you doin' here? I ain't 
                         supposed to be at the Parole Office 
                         'til tomorrow, two o'clock.

               Early notices the man looking through some of his letters 
               and papers.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Social call.

               The Parole Officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers 
               through things inside, as if searching for something. Early 
               is getting pissed off but says nothing.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         You're supposed to call me when you 
                         lose your job Early. I stopped by 
                         the mirror factory today, you left 
                         quite a mess behind there.

                                     EARLY
                         Wasn't my fault...

               He lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger.

                                     EARLY
                         ...It was dangerous there and they 
                         treated me like shit.

               Parole Officer steps over to the refrigerator, opens it, 
               snoops around inside.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                              (swallows a hiccup)
                         Yeah... Well you never have been 
                         'treated right'... Have you?
                              (hiccup)
                         Your father was pickin' on you when 
                         he threw you out of the house for 
                         stealing the tires off his truck. 
                         The Marines misunderstood you when 
                         they gave you that dishonorable 
                         discharge.

               He finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search 
               through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                              (hiccup)
                         ...The police were way out of line 
                         when they stopped you from beating 
                         that bartender half to death. And no 
                         doubt God'll be pickin' on you on 
                         Judgement Day...

                                     EARLY
                         I ain't got nothing against God. 
                         It's the people he let come into the 
                         world... lot of them should have 
                         been stopped at the door. What are 
                         you looking for?

               The Parole Officer ignores the question. He steps up to a 
               sink overflowing with dirty dishes.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         That girlfriend of yours ain't much 
                         for housekeeping, is she.

               Early dismisses the place with a glance.

                                     EARLY
                         I'm thinking about moving...

               Early opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer.

                                     EARLY
                         Maybe down to Texas... Probably get 
                         some work on them offshore oil rigs. 
                         Hear the pay's good... hell, the 
                         weather's got to be better'n here.

               Early sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over 
               to him.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         What are you talking about? You know 
                         you can't leave the state.
                              (hiccup)
                         What you can do is get a job.

               The Parole Officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt 
               pocket, sets it on the table.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         You be at this personnel office, 
                         Friday, three o'clock sharp.

                                     EARLY
                         What is it?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         ...Janitor's job.

                                     EARLY
                         Oh man... come on, I don't want no 
                         janitor job.

               Early lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's 
               prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer 
               bottle, just inches from Early's lips.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Hey, I don't give two shits about 
                         what you want or don't want... I'm 
                         telling you to be there Friday, three 
                         o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be 
                         here for dinner. You understand?

               With that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then 
               stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at 
               him for a moment.

                                     EARLY
                         You oughta think about putting a bag 
                         over your head... Might cure them 
                         hiccups.

               The Parole Officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out 
               of the trailer to his car.

               BRIAN'S DESK IN ANOTHER PART OF LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Brian's in the midst of working his way through pages and 
               pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk. Using 
               chopsticks he shovels Chinese straight out of the carton as 
               he studies Carrie's warehouse photographs.

               CARRIE'S POV

               As we approach Brian from behind, moving closer, closer.

               NEW ANGLE - BRIAN'S DESK

               Carrie steps up behind him. She's rubbing her eyes, having 
               just awakened. A hangover beckons. Brian notices her.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake 
                         you.

                                     CARRIE
                         Thanks. What are you doing?

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, I sat down with my tapes and 
                         your photographs, which are great by 
                         the way... and I started writing.

               Carrie grabs his container of Chinese and takes a few bites. 
               Listens.

                                     CARRIE
                         So how's it going?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I think it's the best stuff I've 
                         done.

               Carrie glances over his shoulder at his writing.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...and I think I know why.

                                     CARRIE
                         Why?

                                     BRIAN
                         Because I was there. And for a moment 
                         that night I understood how she came 
                         to pull the trigger.

                                     CARRIE
                              (sarcastic)
                         This mean your finally going to finish 
                         your thesis?

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's 
                         a book here. Your photographs and my 
                         research, together.

                                     CARRIE
                         A book on the warehouse murders?

                                     BRIAN
                         A book on some of the most infamous 
                         murderers in America. I want to go 
                         to where they lived and where they 
                         killed and I want you to photograph 
                         it.

               Brian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the 
               United States up and lays it out on his desk. He traces a 
               route West. Along the way, specific locations have been 
               circled.

                                     BRIAN
                         What I'm thinking is, we can drop 
                         down through Tennessee, across 
                         Arkansas and into Texas, from there 
                         it's a straight shot into California.
                              (pause)
                         "We don't stop... until we hit the

                         It's about fucking time, Kessler! 
                         I'd just about given up on you.

                                     BRIAN
                         We don't have enough money, but we'll 
                         figure something out.

               Carrie steps up to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...It's either the best idea I've 
                         had in a long time... or there's way 
                         too much MSG in this stuff.

               Brian looks at the container of Chinese in his hand. Carrie 
               takes it from him, sets it down on the road map. Kisses him.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - DAWN

               Early exits the trailer and climbs into his Grand Prix.

               INT. GRAND PRIX

               Early tries to get the engine to tick over. Then... He sees 
               JOHN DIEBOLD, his landlord, emerge from his house and begin 
               lumbering toward the Grand Prix. The two panting ugly-ass 
               pitbulls trot alongside their master.

                                     DIEBOLD
                              (shouts)
                         Hold on a minute there boy!

                                     EARLY
                         Shit!

               Early tries the engine again. Still won't start. Diebold, 
               getting closer. The dogs are barking.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         Goddamit, you're gonna settle up 
                         that rent here and now.

               Hurriedly, Early tries the engine one more time. It starts. 
               Grinning from ear to ear, Early pulls away before Diebold 
               and his dogs reach him.

               Pissed, Diebold grabs a rock and hurls it, hitting Early's 
               car.

               The car stops, dead in its tracks.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         I've had it with your bullshit boy. 
                         I want my money.

               INT. GRAND PRIX

               Early looks in the rear-view mirror and sees... Diebold 
               standing there confrontational.

               Early throws the gearshift into reverse...

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER

               Tires screeching, the car surges toward Diebold and the dogs. 
               Scared shitless... Diebold begins back peddling. Confused, 
               the pitbulls bark, then follow suit.

               Early laughs as he stalks Diebold.

               Diebold jumps out of the way of the Grand Prix just as it 
               pulverizes his portable barbecue.

               Early shifts it into drive and barrels out of the drive.

               NEW ANGLE - DIEBOLD

               As soon as the Grand Prix is out of sight...

                                     DIEBOLD
                              (hollering)
                         You sonofabitch! Come back here!

               Furious, he turns to find Adele staring at him from the window 
               of her trailer.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         That's it! You tell him... I want 
                         you both the fuck out of here by 
                         Sunday or I'm gonna call the Police.

               Adele starts laughing, she tries to hide it with her hand.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         ...You won't be laughing come Sunday 
                         little girl.

               Muttering to himself, he turns back toward his house. He 
               then notices what Adele is laughing at. One pitbull is trying 
               to hump the other.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         Elvis! Get the fuck off him!

               NEW ANGLE - ADELE

               Peering out at him from the trailer window laughing at the 
               dogs.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - UNIVERSITY

               Brian pulls up in his BLACK '62 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL. The 
               suicide doors and leather interior have seen better days. 
               Brian locks his car and walks into the building.

               INT. LOBBY OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - AFTERNOON

               Brian steps up to a large bulletin board. He sees several 
               'Ride-Share' notes to various cities on the board. He pins a 
               Ride-Share note onto the board. We see the note is headlined 
               in red - "CALIFORNIA"

                                     CAROL
                         You know, they say one of these 
                         days...

               Brian glances over his shoulder.

                                     BRIAN
                              (sarcastic)
                         ...the whole thing's going to slide 
                         into the ocean... Yeah, I know.

               Carol peers over Brian's shoulder and reads the note.

                                     CAROL
                         "Looking for someone to take turns 
                         at the wheel and share expenses... 
                         on a week long cross country blue-
                         highways tour of historic murder 
                         sites..."
                              (beat)
                         You gotta be kidding. Who in their 
                         right mind would want to do that?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I would.

               Brian smiles at her and walks away.

                                     CAROL
                              (watching Brian walk 
                              away)
                         Like I said...

               She shakes her head.

                                     EARLY
                         Where's the personnel office at?

               Carol turns to see Early.

                                     RITA
                              (points down the hall)
                         First door on the left.

               She walks away. Early's eye catches the bulletin board, he 
               sees in bold red marker - "CALIFORNIA."

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE THAT NIGHT

               Adele steps out of the trailer.

                                     ADELE
                         Early?

               She walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard 
               to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers 
               in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a 
               shovel digging.

                                     ADELE
                         Early? You down there?

               The sound of digging stops.

                                     EARLY
                              (from inside the hole)
                         What's up Adele? Dinner ready?

                                     ADELE
                         Almost.

               After a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging.

                                     ADELE
                         Early...

               The digging stops again.

                                     ADELE
                         Tell me more about California.

               The moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her.

                                     EARLY
                         Well... for one thing... They think 
                         faster out there, on account of all 
                         that warm weather they got; cold 
                         weather makes people stupid, that's 
                         a fact.

                                     ADELE
                         I guess that'd explain why there's 
                         so many stupid people around here.

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah, and in California you never 
                         have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on 
                         the trees everywhere you turn...
                              (beat)
                         ...and, 'course there ain't no speed 
                         limit out there, and all drugs are 
                         legal... And I heard your first 
                         month's rent is free; state law. I 
                         figure 'til we get settled we can 
                         just move around month to month...

                                     ADELE
                         What'll we do out there?

                                     EARLY
                         Well... the very first thing we're 
                         gonna do... is get us a couple of 
                         six packs of Lucky Lager and climb 
                         up on toppa' that famous Hollywood 
                         sign and howl at the moon...

               Early lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her 
               shoulder at the moon.

                                     ADELE
                         You know... I read once... Ain't 
                         nothin' on that big old moon 'cept 
                         some old golf balls those astronauts 
                         left behind.

                                     EARLY
                         Bull. That ain't right... Government 
                         sends people there all the time, 
                         just don't want us to know about it.

               Adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer.

                                     ADELE
                         Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout 
                         ready.

                                     EARLY
                         I heard that.

               After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in 
               the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked 
               except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early 
               gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.

               EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - DAWN

               Brian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying 
               a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car.

                                     CARRIE
                         What did he sound like on the phone?

               OMITTED

                                     BRIAN
                         Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'

               Brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags.

                                     BRIAN
                              (grins)
                         I like that.

                                     CARRIE
                         I still think we should have met 
                         them first.

                                     BRIAN
                         Beggars can't be choosers. They were 
                         the only ones who answered the ride 
                         share note, remember?

               Carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer.

                                     CARRIE
                         Please God, we're gonna be stuck 
                         with these people for a week, don't 
                         let them be as boring as Brian's 
                         friends. Anything... but that.

               Brian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car 
               hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel.

               INT. LINCOLN

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent 
                         right outta "Deliverance."
                              (quotes from the movie)
                         "Still? Who said anything about a 
                         still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"

                                     CARRIE
                         Funny, very funny.

               Brian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie. 
               Brian laughs.

                                     BRIAN
                              (quoting again)
                         "Aintry? This river don't go to 
                         Aintry."

               EXT. LINCOLN ON STREET

               The engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the 
               street.

               EXT. BUS STATION - DAWN

               PAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele 
               speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice.

                                     ADELE
                         We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. 
                         You leavin' the state, ridin' around 
                         with strangers... besides, what kinda 
                         people would want to stop at places 
                         where other people was murdered.

               The camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is 
               alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early 
               approaches. Just in time to hear...

                                     ADELE
                         What if they're dangerous?

                                     EARLY
                         They ain't dangerous Adele. They're 
                         writers.

               Startled, Adele drops her shoulder bag. It lands on top of a 
               couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag -- 
               all their possessions. A few personal items spill out of it.

                                     ADELE
                         Early Grayce!

               She kneels down to pick things up.

                                     ADELE
                              (changes subject)
                         Did you settle things with Mr. 
                         Diebold?

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah I left him with the car... We're 
                         all squared up now.

               EARLY'S POV

               As Adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, Early 
               notices her prized cactus in the bag.

                                     EARLY
                         What's this?

               He angrily reaches in and grabs it.

                                     ADELE
                         Early!

               She reaches for the cactus but misses.

                                     EARLY
                         What kind of a person would carry a 
                         cactus in her purse!

               Adele bites her lip almost crying. Suddenly, Early looks 
               past Adele to see something, Adele turns too.

               NEW ANGLE

               The Lincoln comes gliding into view.

               INT. LINCOLN - PULLS INTO BUS STATION - DAWN

               Through the windshield we see Early... Adele by his side.

                                     CARRIE
                         You've got to be kidding me, they 
                         look like Okies!

               Brian honks the horn, Early waves back.

                                     CARRIE
                         Jesus... They've probably got five 
                         bucks between them. Turn around.

                                     BRIAN
                         Lighten up...

               ON EARLY AND ADELE

                                     ADELE
                         Geez, they look kinda weird.

                                     EARLY
                         You just smile, let me do all the 
                         talking.

                                     ADELE
                         How many times you gonna tell me 
                         that?

                                     EARLY
                              (smiling at Brian)
                         As many times as it takes.

               EXT. BUS STATION

               Brian stops the Lincoln and gets out. He approaches Early 
               and shakes his hand, then Adele's.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must 
                         be Adele.

               An awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until 
               Brian reaches for Adele's bag.

                                     BRIAN
                         Let me help you.

               Brian picks up her bag and carries it to the Lincoln. Adele 
               is instantly won over by the gesture -- Early leery of it.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Carrie watches as Brian and Early carry their things to the 
               trunk. Carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to 
               zero. When she sits back up, Adele is standing at her window.

                                     ADELE
                         Hi, I'm Adele.

                                     CARRIE
                              (reserved)
                         Carrie.

               She turns away from the window...

                                     ADELE
                              (shyly)
                         I like your hair.

               Carrie turns back, rolls down window...

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Pardon?

                                     ADELE
                         ...I said, I like your hair.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Thank you.

               She turns and sees Early reflected in the side mirror watching 
               her. He grins at her, Carrie looks away.

               NEW ANGLE: FROM INSIDE THE TRUNK OF THE LINCOLN

               Brian crams the last of the bags in, as Early watches.

                                     BRIAN
                         Tight fit.

                                     EARLY
                         Best kind.

               Brian looks to him, Early grins and winks. Brian slams the 
               Lincoln trunk lid shut.

               SCREEN TO BLACK

               EXT. EARLY'S BURNING TRAILER - DAWN

               From the blackness... The camera rises from a pile of rubble. 
               As it ascends we reveal Diebold's pitbulls howling and digging 
               at a mound of fresh earth where Early's hole used to be.

               The crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene. 
               Deep in the distance, the wail of approaching sirens.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Reveal that it's Early's trailer and car that are on fire.

               INT. TRAILER

               Flames consume the magazine photos of Elvis and Priscilla, 
               Farrah and Ryan, Early and Adele. Along with them, the black 
               and white photo of young Early and his mother.

               EXT. BUS STATION - DAWN - OVERHEAD ANGLE

               On the Lincoln as it exits the Bus Station. The camera 
               descends toward a lone trash can, to find there, lying amidst 
               the debris inside... Adele's cactus.

               EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

               The Lincoln passes through on its way out of town.

               INT. MOVING LINCOLN - MORNING

               Brian behind the wheel, Carrie riding shotgun. Early and 
               Adele are sitting in the back seat. An awkward silence 
               prevails. Brian clears his throat.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and 
                         Adele haven't had time for breakfast, 
                         Early.

                                     EARLY
                         Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.

                                     BRIAN
                         Brian.

                                     EARLY
                         Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't 
                         eat much in the mornin', never have. 
                         Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky 
                         Lager's my favorite.

               Brian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious 
               about it.

                                     ADELE
                         It's because of what he read in a 
                         book once... That folks needin' 
                         breakfast is a myth, or whatever, 
                         put out by those cereal people.

               A glance passes between Brian and Carrie. Is she for real?

               CARRIE'S POV - IN VANITY MIRROR

               Early motions Adele not to talk so much.

               NEW ANGLE

                                     BRIAN
                         So what do you do Early?

                                     EARLY
                         Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick 
                         Mirror factory, or I used to...

                                     ADELE
                         One night we figured out how much 
                         bad luck he must have comin' from 
                         all them mirrors he broke...
                              (beat)
                         Four hundred and ninety four years 
                         to work it all off... After he dies, 
                         he'll have to keep coming back to 
                         earth over and over and over...

                                     CARRIE
                         Karma.

               Adele and early show no sign of understanding the word.

                                     ADELE
                         What?

                                     CARRIE
                         Karma...
                              (beat)
                         You know, if you do something bad to 
                         somebody fate will pay you back by 
                         something bad happening to you.

                                     ADELE
                         That French ain't it?

               Carrie glances at the odometer on the dash... THE FIRST MILE 
               clicks over.

               EXT. LINCOLN - OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY

               Everyone takes a last look at the familiar countryside. Carrie 
               is snapping photos of the twisting concrete overpasses and 
               the gloomy grey sky beyond.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele watches Carrie, intrigued by the obvious skill Carrie 
               shows with the camera. Brian glances into the rear-view mirror 
               at Adele.

                                     BRIAN
                         So Adele, did Early happen to mention 
                         the places we'll be stopping at?

               ON ADELE'S REFLECTION IN MIRROR... then Early leans in front 
               of her.

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah Bri' I did.

               Adele leans against Carrie's front seat.

                                     ADELE
                              (to Carrie)
                         Are you takin' the pictures?

                                     CARRIE
                              (surprised)
                         ...Yeah.

                                     ADELE
                         Is it hard to learn?

                                     CARRIE
                         Not really.

               Early pulls Adele back toward the back seat.

                                     EARLY
                              (to Brian)
                         You gonna talk to the people who did 
                         those murders?

                                     BRIAN
                         That's a good idea. Unfortunately 
                         most of them have been executed.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Too bad.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Lincoln drives off down the highway.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATER

               Police and Firemen sift through the smoking ruins of Early's 
               trailer. The Parole Officer pulls up in his car, he gets out 
               and approaches a Police Officer.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         What happened?

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Who are you?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         His Parole Officer.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Right, I talked to you on the phone. 
                         They say it's a torch job, that sound 
                         like your boy?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Could be.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Where would we find him?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch 
                         said he was thinking of moving to 
                         Texas.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Without his car?

               We see the smoldering remains of Early's Grand Prix. In the 
               background Diebold's pitbulls are being dragged away by a 
               Dog Wrangler.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         What about the owner of the house...
                              (reads from note pad)
                         ...this John Diebold, any idea where 
                         he might be?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         No, but I can tell you he's not gonna 
                         be too happy about this.

               From inside Early's hole we hear a voice call out.

                                     LABORER (O.S.)
                         Jesus Christ!

               Parole Officer and Police Officer turn back toward the 
               trailer, as people rush to the site.

               NEW ANGLE - OVERHEAD

               The camera aerials down past those gathering around the 
               freshly dug hole to... a Laborer standing at the bottom of 
               the pit. Alongside his shovel, we see that a man's arm has 
               been unearthed.

               LOW ANGLE UP TO THE TOP OF THE HOLE

               The Police and Parole Officer join several others standing 
               there.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         ...Diebold?

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         ...That'd be my guess.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Looks like somebody cut off his ring 
                         finger.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Well now I'd say that's the least of 
                         Mr. Diebold's problems.

               The two men look to one another... as others begin to unearth 
               the body.

               EXT. MOVING LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD

               Close up, Diebold's ring on a hand twisting open a bottle 
               cap. Pull back to reveal that it is Early as he opens a bottle 
               of Lucky Lager beer and takes a sip. On the back seat between 
               them sits a brown paper bag. Adele reaches into the bag and 
               pulls out a cheap pocket camera. Excitedly she rips open the 
               box and pulls out the camera. She leans over and kisses Early.

                                     ADELE
                         Thank you.

               Early reaches in the bag and pulls out a small plastic bottle 
               of mineral water and an orange juice.

                                     EARLY
                         All right, who gets the...
                              (can't pronounce name)
                         ...water.

               Carrie turns around, Early hands her the water. Early leans 
               forward and hands Brian the orange juice.

                                     EARLY
                         Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a 
                         bags of chips and some jerky, just 
                         holler if you want some.

               Then Early reaches past Brian to the rear-view mirror and 
               hangs a plastic St. Christopher statue around it.

                                     EARLY
                         Can't hurt.

                                     BRIAN
                         How much do I owe you?

                                     EARLY
                         Forget it.

               Adele struggles to understand the camera instructions on the 
               side of the box. She leans forward and shows Carrie her 
               camera.

                                     ADELE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Guess I don't know the first thing 
                         about cameras.

               Carrie deliberates her response for a moment, then...

                                     CARRIE
                         Well, the first thing... is you need 
                         film. Preferably black and white.

               Carrie pulls a roll of film out of her bag and takes Adele's 
               camera to load.

                                     ADELE
                         You wouldn't have any color film, 
                         would ya?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Yeah, sure.

               She pulls a roll of color film out of her camera bag and 
               quickly snaps it into the camera.

                                     ADELE
                         I like things in color, pink, purple, 
                         and red. I dunno, black and white is 
                         kinda... boring.

               Carrie points the camera at a smiling Adele and snaps the 
               first picture.

                                     CARRIE
                         You just aim and press the button.

               Adele takes the camera.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele focuses her camera at the scenery out the side window 
               of the car.

                                     ADELE
                         Look, Pigeon Forge!

               ADELE'S POV

               Road sign to Pigeon Forge.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Adele leans out the side rear window to get a better view.

                                     ADELE
                         I've heard of that! It's where Dolly 
                         Parton has her park. "Dollywood". I 
                         just think that's so clever. 
                         Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it?

               With that, she plops back down into the back seat.

               INT. LINCOLN

                                     EARLY
                              (under his breath)
                         Shush, Adele.

                                     ADELE
                         Early, can we stop there... just for 
                         a little while.

               EXT. HIGHWAY

               As we see the car disappearing into the distance, we can 
               still hear Adele rambling on.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         ...I've always wanted to go there... 
                         It could be such fun.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. LARGE ISOLATED OLD FARM - AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln approaches on a dirtroad and passes a mailbox 
               with the name "BAXTER" on it. The Lincoln turns into the 
               long driveway.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Brian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder.

                                     BRIAN
                         The Novaks are all gone but the fence 
                         that Michael Zaruba was hired to put 
                         up is still here.

               He glances to Carrie, who fires off several photos of the 
               fence and yard.

               The Lincoln continues slowly down the long drive... Up ahead 
               through the windshield Brian sees a beautiful old farm house.

                                     BRIAN
                         The Novaks embraced the young drifter 
                         as one of their own.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               The Lincoln slows to a halt. Carrie and Brian exit the car 
               and begin walking toward the house. Early follows. Adele, 
               uncertain about what's transpiring, trails behind.

                                     ADELE
                         Hey you two.

               Brian and Carrie turn to see... Adele training a camera on 
               them.

                                     ADELE
                         Give me a smile now.

               Brian and Carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. 
               Early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind 
               Brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks.

               Brian and Carrie quickly turn their attention back on the 
               house.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continues into tape 
                              recorder)
                         Neighbors said he was a quiet young 
                         man, who was often seen pushing the 
                         children on the swing set.

               An unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. 
               To the side of the house are the remains of an old swing 
               set. Carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, 
               with the house in the background, SNAP! She fires off a shot.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing)
                         Everything was fine until the day 
                         the family ran out of work for 
                         Michael, and had to ask him to leave.

               As Carrie frames up another shot, Early crosses in front of 
               her camera. Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and 
               poses. Carrie looks to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sorry, Early... Could you step out 
                         the way, for a second?

               Early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. 
               He wanders away from the front of the house. Meanwhile, Adele 
               photographs the moment.

                                     BRIAN
                         The first one to die was the nine 
                         year old daughter...

               Just then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around 
               the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of 
               them. Carrie snaps a final photo.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hello.

               The little girl scans all their faces.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...My name's Brian, what's yours?

               The little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie 
               then back to the little girl.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Could I speak to your parents?

               After an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the 
               yard to the porch and opens the front door.

                                     GIRL
                              (rudely)
                         Pa! There's more of them.

               EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

               Looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see 
               into the entrance hall and through to the open front door. 
               Brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters 
               the house looking for her father. Inside the kitchen, right 
               next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a 
               purse on it.

               Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has 
               obviously seen the purse.

               AT THE FRONT DOOR

               Brian motions for Carrie to join him.

               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses 
               interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins 
               swinging.

               AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE

               Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts 
               three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the 
               little girl and her father step to the front door.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR

               A MIDDLE AGED FARMER with tanned leathery skin. He is not 
               happy. Brian extends his hand...

                                     BRIAN
                              (friendly)
                         Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.

               The father says nothing and does not respond to the extended 
               hand. Brian retracts his hand.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continues -- less 
                              confident)
                         I'm a writer, I'm working on a book 
                         about famous murderers.

               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele swings higher. Her summer dress ripples in the wind. A 
               smile on her face.

               EXT. KITCHEN WINDOW

               Early's entire arm is through the opening. His shoulder 
               presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach 
               the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it 
               toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the 
               while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room.

               EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to 
               the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I'm sure you're aware that this 
                         is the Novak house...

               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele swings even higher. She's lost in the moment. Euphoric.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR

                                     BRIAN
                              (corrects himself)
                         ...I mean, this was the Novak house...
                              (pause)
                         With your permission I'd like to 
                         come in and photograph...

               Before Brian can finish, the man slams the door in his face.

               INT. KITCHEN (ANGLE ON FARMER)

               The Farmer turns away from the front door.

                                     FARMER
                              (muttering)
                         Goddamned ghouls...

               IN THE KITCHEN

               We see that Early and the purse have gone.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR

               Brian is surprised. He just stands there a moment. He's not 
               sure whether to knock again.

               EXT. SWING SET

               The empty swing sways back and forth.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Brian and Carrie walk back to the car.

                                     BRIAN
                              (upset)
                         We could have been in and out of 
                         there in less than ten minutes...

                                     CARRIE
                         Hey, I got some great stuff... it's 
                         okay.

               Brian continues on in a huff until Carrie breaks stride and 
               stops. She pulls him next to her.

                                     CARRIE
                         It's okay... okay?

               Brian glances back at the house. She interrupts his glance, 
               kisses him.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing on the 
                              heel of the kiss)
                         ...That house is part of American 
                         history now, whether he likes it or 
                         not.

               They enter the car.

                                     EARLY
                         Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be 
                         surprised if that Karma thing don't 
                         come back and get him.

               Carrie, surprised at Early's new found philosophical belief. 
               She looks into her side view mirror... And sees Early smiling 
               back at her. Carrie looks away...

               CARRIE'S POV

               Shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as 
               the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches 
               from her porch.

               EXT. - LINCOLN PULLS UP TO MOTEL AND PARKS.

               INT. MOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A small roadside diner. A fair number of people inside having 
               dinner. Adele, Early, Carrie, and Brian are seated at one of 
               the tables.

               AT THEIR TABLE

               Carrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude 
               fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with 
               his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right 
               hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's 
               serious about his "eating."

                                     BRIAN
                              (studying his map)
                         Well we've come three hundred miles 
                         so far. Not a bad day's haul.

               Early doesn't bother to respond. He keeps eating.

                                     BRIAN
                         You got any family or friends in 
                         California, Early?

               CU ANGLE ON EARLY

               With a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate.

                                     EARLY
                              (chewing)
                         Nope... You?

               ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE

               Early's foot itches... He tries to scratch it but it doesn't 
               do any good.

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         No.

               ANGLE - THE GROUP

               As Brian folds up the map. Early takes off his boot, then 
               his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early 
               brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he 
               eats. Carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.

                                     ADELE
                         ...Well, least we got each other. 
                         That's somethin'.

               OMITTED

               Brian looks up, sees Carrie's expression... Then what's 
               causing it... Early mops up the last bit of food on his plate. 
               He notices Brian and Carrie staring at him and slowly puts 
               his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock.

               Brian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling 
               his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab 
               to Early.

                                     EARLY
                         Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one.
                              (prompts Adele)
                         Think it's time we hit the sack.

               Early winks at Brian, Carrie catches the wink. Early and 
               Adele get up and head for the door. Adele waves goodnight.

                                     ADELE
                              (to Carrie)
                         Sweet dreams.

               INT. CARRIE AND BRIAN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Close on Carrie, she is reflected in a mirror. Reveal, Carrie 
               wearing only a T-shirt is at the vanity angrily brushing her 
               teeth. In the bathroom next to her, a bath is running. In 
               the adjacent bedroom, Brian is in the bed working on his 
               notes.

                              of water)
                         You mean because I object to having 
                         somebody take off their shoe and 
                         scratch their foot while I'm eating 
                         I'm prejudiced?

               INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

                                     BRIAN
                              (reading notes)
                         He can't help the way he was raised. 
                         I kinda feel sorry for him.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Carrie pauses in brushing her teeth.

                                     CARRIE
                         Feel sorry for him? Obviously you 
                         didn't get a whiff of that sock?

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         Bitch, bitch, bitch!

                                     CARRIE
                              (under her breath)
                         Up yours.

                                     BRIAN
                         I heard that.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Carrie finishes brushing her teeth. Secretively she gives 
               Brian the finger...

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         ...heard that too.

               Carrie glances at the bath water running in the tub. It's 
               rusty brown and disgusting. She pulls the plug on the bath 
               idea.

               INT. EARLY AND ADELE'S MOTEL BATHROOM ROOM - SAME TIME

               The tap is running at the sink as Early empties the stolen 
               purse. He adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash.

                                     EARLY
                         Can you believe thirty bucks for 
                         this room... for what? A lumpy 
                         mattress, that crummy TV and a 
                         crapper.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Early, sing me a song.

               Early continues to sift through all the items from the purse.

                                     EARLY
                         Which one.

               INT. EARLY AND ADELE'S MOTEL ROOM

               Adele starts to sing a song.

               OMITTED

               Early start sing with her... As the song ends.

                                     ADELE
                              (laughs)
                         Hey can we go to that Chinese 
                         restaurant when we get to Los Angeles? 
                         You know, to see all them famous 
                         footprints?

               ON EARLY IN BATHROOM

               Early reaches down into the bottom of the purse and pulls 
               out a pair of glistening stainless steel scissors.

                                     EARLY
                         Only if they let me put mine down 
                         too.

               He stares at the scissors curiously, then switches off the 
               bathroom light.

               DARKNESS

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         Look Carrie, we're gonna be stuck 
                         with these people for a week...

               Click, a light is turned on. Revealing...

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

               Brian has turned on the nightstand light. He and Carrie are 
               lying in bed.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...And all I'm saying is I think we 
                         ought to try and get along with them. 
                         That's all.

                                     CARRIE
                         You try, I'm gonna pretend they're 
                         with somebody else.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         I don't want to talk about it.

               Brian turns the light off. From the blackness...

                                     CARRIE
                         Pretty smooth how he stiffed us on 
                         dinner?

               Brian switches the light back on.

                                     BRIAN
                         He didn't stiff us. He paid for the 
                         gas remember.

               Silence... Brian reaches out for the light... when

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm telling you he's nearly broke 
                         and we're going to end up paying for 
                         those two.

               Brian decides to leave the light on. He moves closer to 
               Carrie. He slides up against her backside. He reaches for 
               her under the sheets. Kisses her neck.

                                     BRIAN
                         You finished?

               Carrie pushes her body up against his in response.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Um, maybe... maybe not.

               Brian's mouth moves down along her back. He slips beneath 
               the sheets. From the expression on her face, she obviously 
               approves... Yet she can't resist slipping in another remark...

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Um... Funky fucking sock.

               Carrie rolls over on her back. Brian moves on top of her. 
               Kisses her stomach.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...and what's with that hair? Is 
                         that grease or motor oil or what?

               Carrie reaches down and grabs two fists full of Brian's hair. 
               She pulls him to her. He slides up along her chest, kissing 
               her. Things heat up. She reaches out, grasps his arms. Pulls 
               him closer.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...you believe that tattoo? Looks 
                         like he had another girls name there 
                         and carved it out.

               Brian bites at her neck. She stops talking. His sweating 
               shoulder presses against her face. She turns her head to 
               encourage him.

               In the dresser mirror... she sees their shadowy reflections. 
               Their bodies atangle under the sheets.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...and that body odor.

               Their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. Intoxicates 
               her. His aggression excites her. She pulls him into her. The 
               metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as 
               they make love.

               Then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider 
               and emerges in the next room...

               TO FIND

               Early leaning quietly against the same wall. Listening to 
               them. As he does, he uses the scissors to cut through the 
               crusty bandage on his finger. Then, across the room he notices 
               Adele in bed asleep... the scissors stop.

               EXT. EARLY'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               Early exits his motel room, opens a bottle of Lucky Lager 
               against a soda dispenser, and walks over to the motel diner.

               INT. MOTEL DINER

               Early enters the diner drinking his morning beer. Adele is 
               not with him. He spots Brian and Carrie seated opposite one 
               another in one of the booths. He walks up to their table and 
               drops down uninvited on the seat next to Carrie.

                                     BRIAN
                         Morning...

               Early lifts his beer bottle in salute.

                                     EARLY
                         She wasn't feeling so good.

               The WAITRESS arrives with a menu, offers it to Early.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Breakfast?

                              (burps)
                         Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never 
                         have.

               The Waitress notices Early's bottle of beer.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Ah sir... sir.

               She gets Early's attention.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (concerned)
                         We ah... don't have a liquor license 
                         here. So I'm afraid...

                                     EARLY
                         Well don't be, I got plenty more 
                         where this one came from.

               The Waitress gives him a curious look and walks away.

               Just then, Brian look past Early... A surprised expression 
               crosses Brian's face. Early turns to see... Adele approaching 
               the table. Her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble 
               Carrie's. It looks like shit.

                                     CARRIE
                              (at a loss for words)
                         You cut your hair.

               Adele smiles, pleased with Carrie for noticing. She sits 
               down next to Brian.

                                     ADELE
                         Early cut it.
                              (smiles at Early)
                         ...Once he gets an idea in his head 
                         there's no holding him back.

               Carrie looks to Brian curiously. Adele is distracted by a 
               small cactus on the window near the table.

                                     BRIAN
                         Nice job Early.

               Carrie notices Adele's 'new' (stolen) purse... We see the 
               wheels turning in Carrie's head. How? Where?

               EXT. MOTEL - LATER

               Early walks toward the Lincoln. It is parked outside Brian 
               and Carrie's room. The front door is ajar, he pushes it open. 
               He sees Carrie's reflection in the bathroom mirror, she's in 
               her underwear, pulling on her jeans. Early watches her for a 
               moment. There's no mistaking what's on his mind... as his 
               eyes scan her body. Carrie pulls on her T-shirt, steps out 
               of the bathroom and sees Early just outside the door.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Need a hand with those bags?

                                     CARRIE
                         No, thanks, I can manage.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Carrie turns back to the dresser and gathers up the last few 
               things. She glances into the dresser mirror looking for 
               Early's reflection at the door, but he's gone. Relieved, she 
               turns the corner to grab her bags and finds Early standing 
               right there! Looking at her. He startles her.

                                     EARLY
                         I got 'em.

               He picks up her bags and walks out of the room. Carrie watches 
               him, then she steps to the doorway.

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         All set?

                              (startled)
                         Fuck!

                         Take your time.

               CARRIE LOOKS BACK TO EARLY

               CARRIE'S POV - EXT. MOTEL

               Early places the bags in the Lincoln's trunk. Adele sees 
               Early carrying Carrie's bag, Adele looks jealous.

               EXT. MOTEL

               In the foreground Carrie's door closes.

               TO BLACK.

               EXT. LINCOLN/HIGHWAY - LATER

               Lincoln passes through frame.

               INT. MOVING LINCOLN - NOON

               Brian at wheel, Carrie next to him loading her camera. Early 
               in the back seat, Adele next to him pulls out some make up 
               from her bag, we see the little cactus from the motel lobby. 
               She begins to put on some lipstick. Early reaches into the 
               frontseat and grabs the manuscript that sits between Brian 
               and Carrie.

                                     EARLY
                              (starts to read)
                         This the book your writing?

                                     BRIAN
                         It's just a work in progress, kinda 
                         rough.

                                     EARLY
                         This guy killed a mess of people.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who?

                                     EARLY
                         Henry Lucas.

                                     BRIAN
                         Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only 
                         convicted of killing eleven but he 
                         claimed to have killed over three 
                         hundred.

                                     EARLY
                         Wonder what all them people done 
                         made him so mad?

               Brian looks to Early in his rear-view mirror.

               BANG!!

               The front tire blows... the car lurches. Brian reacts, pulling 
               the Lincoln to the side of the road in a dusty halt.

               EXT. LINCOLN/HIGHWAY - NOON

               Brian and Early unload the trunk to get to the spare tire.

               AT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE

               Brian struggles with the wheel and the jack.

                                     EARLY
                         Here Bri' let me do that.

               Early takes over. He pulls off his shirt, jacks the car up 
               and begins replacing the wheel with ease.

                                     EARLY
                         How did he get away with it for so 
                         long anyhow?

                                     BRIAN
                         He almost always killed strangers. 
                         Spent years moving on from one place 
                         to another. That made it real hard 
                         to track him down.

               Carrie scans the landscape with her camera. She sees Adele 
               walking around a small roadside graveyard. She is reading 
               the epitaphs on the headstones. Carrie fires off a few shots. 
               Then she sees Early, she can't help but notice Early's lean 
               body. She zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo. Click!!

               Early completes the task. Together he and Brian begin putting 
               everything back in the trunk.

               Suddenly, from behind, Adele jumps onto Early's back, 
               surprising him. He gives her a "horsey ride" around the 
               Lincoln.

               ON CARRIE

               She notices Early's wallet on the ground.

               ON EARLY AND ADELE

               She's riding him, covering his eyes playfully.

               ON CARRIE

               She picks up the wallet.

               BENEATH THE LINCOLN

               Early's feet galloping.

               ON CARRIE

               She opens the wallet to find two one dollar bills inside.

               WITH EARLY AND ADELE

               As they come around the side of the car and to a stop in 
               front of Carrie. She holds up his wallet... watches his eyes.

                                     CARRIE
                         You dropped this.

                                     ADELE
                         Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky 
                         day.

               She hands the wallet back to him. Something between them 
               goes unspoken.

               EXT. A GAS STATION - LATER THAT DAY

               The Lincoln pulls in.

               INT. LINCOLN

                                     BRIAN
                         I guess it's your turn to pay Early.

               Early nods and Brian looks over to Carrie, making sure she 
               heard. The four of them get out of the car.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Early starts toward the gas station store. He checks his 
               wallet, two dollars left. Carrie and Adele lean against the 
               car. Carrie lights up a cigarette. She watches Early to see 
               what his next move will be. Brian removes the gas cap and 
               sticks the gas pump nozzle in. It pumps away.

               CLOSE ON THE GAS METER

               It starts turning over... $$$$$ Click... Click... Click...

               (crossing the tarmac)... with Early. His face expressionless. 
               His mind racing...

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian walks around the Lincoln; checking the tires. Carrie 
               watches Early intently.

               CLOSE ON EARLY

               He walks toward the entrance.

               HIS POV

               Inside the store he sees a video surveillance camera. It 
               worries him. Distracts him momentarily.

               Suddenly from behind him... o.s. A car horn HONKS LOUDLY!

               Early turns to see a late model Mercedes behind him. He just 
               gazes at the driver. Aggravated, the driver leans on the 
               horn and motions Early out of his way. Early stares at the 
               man a moment longer, then steps to one side and lets the car 
               pull past him.

               WIDE ON THE GAS STATION

               A FAT MAN in his late thirties exits from behind the wheel 
               of the Mercedes. Early watches him as he takes a money clip 
               from his pocket and walks toward the entrance to the mini 
               market.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               The girls leaning against the car. Adele watches Carrie take 
               a drag on her cigarette.

                                     ADELE
                         I used to smoke before I met Early. 
                         But he broke me of that.

               Her remark gets Carrie's attention.

                                     CARRIE
                         Broke you?

               ON EARLY

               He watches the Fat Man inside the office.

               EARLY'S POV - EXT./INT. GAS STATION

               The Fat Man pays THE ATTENDANT for gas and is handed the 
               restroom key.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian walks to the front of the Lincoln. He passes Carrie 
               and Adele...

                                     ADELE
                         Early don't think women should smoke 
                         or curse or drink liquor.

                                     CARRIE
                         So you don't do any of those things.

               Carrie takes a quick look to the mini-market. She's lost 
               sight of Early.

                                     ADELE
                         Better not, or Early'd whip me.

                                     CARRIE
                              (back to Adele)
                         He whips you?

               INT./EXT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man turns the key and enters the bathroom. The door 
               starts to swing shut behind him, but...

               TWO FINGERS catch it before it does.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Only when I deserve it.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian lifts the hood of the Lincoln... Reaches for the 
               radiator cap.

               INT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man is standing at the urinal. He has a ureterostomy 
               bag he's emptying, when...

               Early's hand hits the blow dryer. A whirring sound fills the 
               room. The Fat Man turns his head. Early lunges at him from 
               behind, yanks his head back and rips a switchblade across 
               his throat!

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND - CU

               A BLAST of steam from the radiator startles Brian!

               INT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man clutches at his throat. Sees the blood on his 
               palms. He looks up in shock. Early pounds the man's head 
               into the wall.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian checking the oil, pulls out the dip stick.

               NEW ANGLE: CU

               Black oil runs down the metal blade.

               INT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man falls to his knees against the urinal. His hand 
               grasping the lever. The urinal flushes. Water flows. The Fat 
               Man's blood mixes with it. The urinal overflows. The blood 
               tinged water spills onto the white tile floor. Early pries 
               the dead man's fist off the lever.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian slams the Lincoln's hood shut.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Early struggles to turn the fat corpse over.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian steps up to the gas nozzle and pulls it out of the 
               car.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Early reaches in the dead man's pocket and removes his money 
               clip.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               The gas meter stops turning.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Early calmly washes his hands in the beat up ceramic sink. 
               He pulls a comb from his pocket and combs his hair in the 
               mirror.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian pulls a squeegee across the front windshield. Water 
               washes the dirt away.

               INT. BATHROOM - EXTREME CU

               The bloody water spiralling down the drain hole.

               EXT. GAS STATION

               Early exits the bathroom... and runs straight into Brian, 
               about to enter.

                                     EARLY
                              (friendly)
                         Hey Bri'... ah... You don't want to 
                         go in there. It's a real mess, if 
                         you know what I mean.

               Brian glances at the bathroom door. Down below, a thin stream 
               of the Fat Man's blood begins to trickle out from under the 
               door... just barely touching the toe of Brian's shoe.

                                     BRIAN
                         That bad?

                                     EARLY
                         ...Then some.

               Early puts his arm around Brian and turns him back toward 
               the car.

               AT THE CAR

               Adele takes a photo of them, approaching. The attendant steps 
               up to Carrie.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to Carrie)
                         Comes to twenty eight dollars.

                                     CARRIE
                         Talk to him.

               Carrie points to Early. As Brian and Early approach the car, 
               Early pulls out the money clip.

                                     EARLY
                         Call it an even thirty.

               Early peels off thirty bucks from the money clip. He sees 
               Carrie watching him, Early smiles.

                                     EARLY
                         I'll drive Bri'.

               Hearing that, Carrie climbs into the back seat. Adele climbs 
               over the backrest into the frontseat.

                                     EARLY
                         Adele, get in the back.

               She climbs again into the backseat.

               Early is driving. Brian riding shotgun, is making some notes 
               in his manuscript. Adele is teaching a reluctant Carrie to 
               play a card game called "SNAP."

                                     ADELE
                         ...Hey you're good. Thought you said 
                         you never played before?

                         I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

                         ...They never caught that Black Dolya 
                         Killer, huh?

                                     BRIAN
                         Dahlia, no.

                                     EARLY
                         Now why is that?

                                     BRIAN
                         Some people think it's because he 
                         never killed again. He just 
                         disappeared back into society.

                                     EARLY
                         You don't sound too convinced 'bout 
                         that?

                                     BRIAN
                         I always thought it was the work of 
                         a serial killer. Anyone who took 
                         that much time and care bisecting 
                         another human being must have been 
                         enjoying it and would have done it 
                         again. And again. Until someone 
                         stopped him.

                                     EARLY
                         That your... "theory", ain't that 
                         what they call it?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah.

                                     EARLY
                         You wanna hear mine?

               Carrie listens in as she continues to play cards with Adele.

                                     BRIAN
                              (amused)
                         Sure.

                                     EARLY
                         Ain't you goin' to record it?

               Brian picks up his tape recorder.

                                     BRIAN
                              (into tape)
                         Early Grayce, June twenty third.

               Brian hands Early the hand held tape recorder.

                                     EARLY
                              (into tape)
                         Well I'll just bet he's still alive. 
                         Old, livin' in some trailer park or 
                         somethin' somewhere, but still alive. 
                         Thinkin' every night 'bout what he 
                         done. Goin' over and over it in his 
                         mind. How smart he was for getting 
                         away with it.

               Carrie is chilled by the intensity of Early's remark. She 
               watches him out of the corner of her eye. SMACK! Adele's 
               hand hits the pile of cards and she wins the game. Startled, 
               Carrie turns back to Adele.

                                     ADELE
                              (to Carrie)
                         You lose!

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Early)
                         I suppose anything's possible.

               Brian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his 
               notes.

               NEW ANGLE: CLOSE UP BRIAN'S SHOE

               Revealing... the blood encrusted toe of his shoe.

               NEW ANGLE: CU ON EARLY

                                     EARLY
                         You ever play any pool Bri'?

               EARLY'S POV

               Up ahead a HONKY TONK BAR with a large sign "POOL TABLES, 
               BOWLING & MUSIC"

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD

               The Lincoln passes by the LARGE SIGN.

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         I can hold my own...

               EXT. MOTEL - DUSK

               A high angle looks down on the modest cluster of rooms below. 
               The motel sign pulses erratically in foreground. Moths flicker 
               about the light.

               CLOSER

               The Lincoln is parked in front of Brian and Carrie's room. 
               The horn honks. Early is behind the wheel, engine running. 
               Brian steps out of the motel room.

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         Hey Minnesota Fats!

               Carrie appears at the door holding her camera.

                                     CARRIE
                              (sarcastic)
                         Don't forget your key.

               She hands Brian the key.

                                     BRIAN
                         Why'd I open my big mouth?

               Brian takes the key and walks to the car.

               Carrie sees Adele standing outside her door. Brian enters 
               the Lincoln.

                                     CARRIE
                              (to Adele)
                         Why didn't you go with them?

               The Lincoln pulls away.

                                     ADELE
                         I told you how Early feels 'bout a 
                         woman drinking.

                                     CARRIE
                         How'd you meet Early?

               Carrie swings the camera around to Adele, and snaps off a 
               shot.

                                     ADELE
                              (grins)
                         I was hitchhiking' one day and he 
                         picked me up. At first I wasn't gonna 
                         get in on account of his car was in 
                         such sorry shape. I said, "I ain't 
                         never seen a white man drivin' a car 
                         like this."

               Carrie snaps another shot of Adele. Every once in a while 
               Adele feels like she should be "posing" for the shots that 
               Carrie's taking of her. So, occasionally, as she carries on 
               her conversation with Carrie, she does.

                                     ADELE
                              (continues)
                         An' he said right back, "You shouldn't 
                         judge by appearances little lady... 
                         this vehicle might just be a flying 
                         saucer disguised as a car, for all 
                         you know."

                                     ADELE
                         Well, I got in and we got to talkin', 
                         and the next thing I know, I'd moved 
                         in with him in this old trailer.
                              (beat)
                         Hey! Wouldn't it be something if we 
                         all ended up sharing a house together 
                         in California?

               ON CARRIE

               She lowers the camera from her eye and studies Adele.

                                     CARRIE
                         You know I can fix that haircut for 
                         you, if you want?

                                     ADELE
                         You can?

               EXT. BOWLING ALLEY BAR - NIGHT

               A nondescript "joint" on the outskirts of town. American 
               cars. American pickup trucks parked outside. The Lincoln 
               pulls into foreground and parks. Early gets out of the Lincoln 
               and looks around.

                                     EARLY
                         I wonder if there's any "doors" out 
                         here?

               Brian exits the Lincoln and looks at Early questioning.

                                     EARLY
                         You know... "openings" to other 
                         dimensions.
                              (pause)
                         I read there are a lot of them out 
                         West, mostly in the desert. They say 
                         if you know what you're doing, you 
                         can travel anywhere in the Universe 
                         in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't 
                         that come in handy?

               Brian looks at him blankly. He can't think of a thing to say 
               in response. Early walks toward the entrance of the bar. 
               Brian joins him.

                                     BRIAN
                         By the way, I'm not much of a pool 
                         player.

                                     EARLY
                         Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I 
                         can teach you everything ya need ta 
                         know.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah?

                                     EARLY
                         Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few 
                         points first game.

                                     BRIAN
                         Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle 
                         me?

                                     EARLY
                         Nah... how much money have you got?

               They both laugh and enter the bar.

               CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Adele is sitting in a chair in front of the dresser mirror 
               drinking a beer. Carrie is cutting her hair. In the mirror 
               Adele watches Carrie for a moment. She notices the cigarette 
               dangling from her lips.

                                     ADELE
                         How do you get your cigarette to 
                         stay there like that.

               Carrie looks in the mirror.

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm cool.

                                     ADELE
                         Could I try that?

               Carrie takes out a fresh cigarette and hands it to Adele. 
               Together they stare into the mirror with their dangling 
               cigarettes. Adele drops her cigarette, as she reaches down 
               for it she notices Carrie's portfolio.

                                     ADELE
                         What's this?

                                     CARRIE
                         It's a portfolio of my work.

                                     ADELE
                         Your pictures. Can I see 'em?

                                     CARRIE
                         Sure.

               Adele grabs the black leather binder and sets it in her lap. 
               Carrie continues to cut Adele's hair. Adele opens the binder 
               and takes a look at the first erotic image and slaps the 
               cover back down. She's embarrassed.

                                     ADELE
                         Jesus!

               Carrie watches her in amusement. After a moment, Adele 
               reconsiders, and opens the book. She gazes at the shocking 
               photograph.

                                     ADELE
                         You took this picture?

                                     CARRIE
                         Took 'em all.

               Carrie resumes cutting Adele's hair. Adele thumbs through 
               several photographs.

                                     CARRIE
                         That's me.

                                     ADELE
                         No it is not!

                                     CARRIE
                         Hold still.

                                     ADELE
                         Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early 
                         found a picture of me like that I'd 
                         be black and blue for a week.

               Adele notices Carrie's scowl in the dresser mirror. Carrie 
               stops cutting.

                                     CARRIE
                              (suddenly serious)
                         You shouldn't let him do that to 
                         you...

                                     ADELE
                         Do what?

                                     CARRIE
                         Adele... are you serious?

                                     ADELE
                              (defensive)
                         You think Early's bad to me, don't 
                         you?

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah.

               Carrie starts cutting Adele's hair again.

                                     ADELE
                         Well... You're wrong. I ain't saying 
                         Early ain't never hit me... but he 
                         never hurt me.

               When Carrie doesn't respond, Adele grabs Carrie's scissor 
               hand and stops her from continuing. Carrie looks at Adele's 
               reflection in the dresser mirror.

                                     ADELE
                              (continues)
                         ...When I was fourteen years old 
                         three boys raped me in the back of a 
                         truck, and beat me so bad I was in 
                         bed for almost four months...
                              (beat)
                         ...I feel safe with Early, most the 
                         time he treats me pretty good. And I 
                         know he wouldn't let nothin' like 
                         that ever happen to me again...

               Carrie is speechless, Adele looks in the mirror at her new 
               haircut.

                                     ADELE
                         Hey, that ain't so bad now.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY BAR

               The patrons are young men and women. Eighteen to thirty. The 
               River's Edge kids today. Leather. Ludes and Beer. Wasted. 
               Rowdy.

               We follow one of the waitresses through the bar... As she 
               passes by a pool table one of the players, A LARGE YOUNG 
               CRACKER, makes a grab at her...

                                     LARGE YOUNG CRACKER
                         When you gonna give me so o' that!

               She spins safely out of his reach.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Maybe when you grow up a little sonny.

               Some guys, close enough to hear her over the noise, laugh at 
               her put down. She moves on until she reaches...

               Brian standing near a small high table. Early's not with 
               him. She sets four beers down on the table. Brian tries to 
               talk to her over the music. He leans in close. His mouth to 
               her ear.

                                     BRIAN
                         These aren't Lucky Lager, I ordered 
                         Lucky Lager.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Sorry honey, 'ain't nothin Lucky 
                         around here.

               The waitress laughs. Brian smiles and glances around the 
               room. He notices the Large Young Cracker staring at him.

               ACROSS THE ROOM

               Early steps out of the bathroom and makes his way back to 
               Brian.

               NEW ANGLE ON BRIAN

               He watches the waitress disappear into the crowd, then turns 
               to find the Large Young Cracker in his face!

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                         What did you say to her city boy!

               The Young Cracker is obviously very drunk.

                                     BRIAN
                         Nothing, I jus...

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                              (cuts him off)
                         What's a jism gargling cum drunk 
                         fairy like you looking at a pretty 
                         girl like that for anyway?

               The Young Cracker doesn't notice Early return from the 
               bathroom. He moves in next to Brian. Early is relaxed and 
               nonchalant as he looks over the Young Cracker. He leans closer 
               to Brian.

                                     EARLY
                              (matter of factly)
                         You'd better hit him first Bri', 
                         'cos it's comin'.

               With his eyes on Brian, Early grabs a beer. Brian is scared, 
               and confused, with one ear and one eye on the Young Cracker, 
               the other on Early.

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                         This yur' boyfriend?

                                     BRIAN
                              (dumbfounded)
                         What?

                                     EARLY
                         Hit him.

               Early looks at the beer.

                                     EARLY
                              (angry)
                         Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager!

               Early takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out. 
               It hits the Young Cracker. The Cracker looks down at his 
               shirt in shock. Early is oblivious.

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                              (to Early)
                         Hey Asshole!

               Brian is frozen, confused, doesn't know who to address. Early 
               continues to ignore the Young Cracker.

                                     BRIAN
                         They don't stock it here Early.

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                              (to Early, furious)
                         Why you fuckin'...

               The Young Cracker moves to hit Early. Early swiftly smashes 
               his beer bottle into the oncoming face. The Young Cracker 
               doubles over clutching his face in agony. Early kicks him in 
               the face, sending the Young Cracker to the ground. Early 
               finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work 
               boots.

               Two large tough guys approach Early and Brian. Brian's heart 
               racing, Early cool as a cucumber. Instead of taking on Early, 
               they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. The 
               waitress returns to their table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Sorry about that, he's always causing 
                         trouble.

               She sets down two beers and two shots, doubles.

                                     WAITRESS
                         These are on the house.

               INT. CARRIE AND BRIAN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Carrie and Adele split the last bottle of beer between them. 
               They are sitting on the floor and Adele has Carrie's foot in 
               her lap. She's painting Carrie's toenails bright red. Neither 
               of them is feeling any pain.

                                     ADELE
                         My momma's a beautician. Guess that's 
                         where I get it from. She wouldn't 
                         hear of my moving in with Early... 
                         on account of his just getting out 
                         of jail and all. Ain't seen her in 
                         nearly a year now. I wish she'd call 
                         me, just once.

                                     CARRIE
                              (interrupting)
                         What's Early been in jail for?

                                     ADELE
                              (reluctantly)
                         Carryin' a gun.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Anything else?

                                     ADELE
                         An' resistin' arrest... At least 
                         that's what the Police said.

                                     CARRIE
                         Jeez... Adele!

               Adele realizes she has said too much, looks at her watch.

                                     ADELE
                         I'd better be goin'. It's late.

               Adele hastily weaves her way out the door.

                                     CARRIE
                         Great.

               Carrie stares down at her feet. Red toenails. Cottonballs 
               between the toes.

               EXT. THE BOWLING ALLEY BAR

               Early and Brian exit the bar. They make their way to the 
               Lincoln. On the way...

                                     EARLY
                         Got to see a man about a mule.

               Brian looks at Early, doesn't understand.

                                     EARLY
                         Gotta take a piss.

               Early branches off behind the car.

                                     EARLY
                         Any reebs left in the back seat?

               Early starts to take a leak.

                                     EARLY
                         Aaahhhhh...
                              (relief)
                         That's what we used to call a beer 
                         when we was kids... Beer spelled 
                         backwards.

               Brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last Lucky Lager. 
               He crosses to the other side of the car and hands Early the 
               beer.

                                     BRIAN
                         Last one.

               Early stares at the last of the Lucky Lagers.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Well I probably drunk more than 
                         my share, anyway... you go on an' 
                         have it.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, it's all yours. It's on me... 
                         for saving my ass back there.

               Early takes the beer.

                                     EARLY
                         Hey, that's what buddies are for, 
                         right...?

               Early polishes off the rest of the bottle and heaves it into 
               the woods.

                                     EARLY
                              (voice drops almost 
                              to a whisper)
                         You know those doors I was talking 
                         about? Found two of them back in 
                         Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking 
                         for one the first time. Me and the 
                         boys are just swingin' our sickles 
                         by the side of the road, and I turned 
                         around and there it was... this door 
                         with this bright blinding white light 
                         all around it... course I'm thinkin' 
                         I must be sunstroked or somethin'... 
                         so I close my eyes figurin' I'll 
                         count ten and it'll be gone right... 
                         so I'm countin'...
                              (he closes his eyes)
                         ...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta 
                         piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. 
                         An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it 
                         won't be there right...

               When Early opens his eyes, he sees a concerned look on Brian's 
               face.

                                     EARLY
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...and it wasn't.

               An awkward silence.

               Then Early starts laughing. Brian follows suit. They both 
               climb back in the car. Their forced laughter trails off.

               Brian shifts the Lincoln back into gear and segues 
               awkwardly...

                                     BRIAN
                         What were you "swinging a sickle" 
                         for?

               Early stares at Brian. For a moment Brian is unsure what 
               Early will say, or do? Then Early grins...

                                     EARLY
                         For... 'bout three years.

               Brian brakes their eye contact, looks back out onto the 
               highway and just drives off.

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               The door opens revealing Brian silhouetted in the doorway. 
               Under the influence of Lucky Lager, he fumbles with the key... 
               gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him. Carrie 
               remains stonily silent, in the dark.

                                     BRIAN
                         Gotta see a man about a mule... What's 
                         wrong?

               A few seconds pass.

                                     CARRIE
                         The same thing that's been "wrong" 
                         the whole trip. Your good buddy Early.

               Carrie, in bed, switches on the side table light. Reveals 
               Brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without 
               falling over.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who said he's my good buddy?

                                     CARRIE
                         You sure been acting like you were...
                              (redneck accent)
                         ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' 
                         and ever' thang.

               Brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey come on, you two were drinking 
                         too... so what's the big deal.

               Brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the 
               bathroom.

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah, and you should've seen how 
                         terrified she was that he'd find 
                         out. He beats her.

                                     BRIAN
                         How do you know that?

                         ...but only when she "deserves" it. 
                         Did you know he was in jail?

               BATHROOM

               Brian turns on the light. Takes a piss. A long one.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.

               Suddenly, from right behind him:

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         Bullshit!

               Startled, Brian turns to see Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...He told her it was for carrying a 
                         gun, but the truth could be murder 
                         for all we know.

               No response from Brian. Carrie walks away.

               LIVING ROOM

               Carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. Brian 
               leans out the bathroom door:

                                     BRIAN
                         Stop being so fucking melodramatic! 
                         If it was murder he'd still be locked 
                         up or on parole, in which case he 
                         wouldn't be allowed to leave the 
                         state.

                                     CARRIE
                         Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! 
                         Geezus Brian!

               Brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid 
               of me!") He pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...

                                     BRIAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Of course! The accent, the clothes, 
                         and those table manners!... He's got 
                         to be a mass murderer!
                              (pause)
                         What else could he be?

               He switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, 
               and begins to pull his jeans off. Carrie climbs into bed.

                                     BRIAN
                         You know, it wouldn't even surprise 
                         me if he turned out to be... a 
                         Republican!

               Brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. Carrie 
               switches off the the only light in the room. In the dark, we 
               hear a thud as Brian trips over a chair.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamnit!... my fucking toe!

               EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Carrie leaves the motel room, ice bucket in hand.

                                     CARRIE
                              (to Brian inside room)
                         Try not to lose consciousness 'til I 
                         get back.

               EXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR

               At the far end of a narrow hallway, Carrie finds an ice 
               machine rumbling away noisily. The only illumination, a single 
               fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it.

               AT THE ICE MACHINE

               With her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges 
               for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of 
               her eye, she notices...

               SOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The 
               silhouette of a man.

               Carrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for 
               another way out. There is none.

               She tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of 
               ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind 
               races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the 
               fluorescent light. It's Early.

                                     EARLY
                         Ain't you done enough drinking for 
                         tonight?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Brian hurt his foot.

               Early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a 
               solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His 
               torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at 
               him.

                                     EARLY
                         Sometimes... Don't know why it is... 
                         I get so hot I can't stand it. I 
                         just start sweating like a dog. You 
                         ever get like that?

                                     CARRIE
                              (tenuous)
                         No.

               Early spits the ice cube back into his hand. He presses it 
               against the back of his neck.

                                     EARLY
                         I can feel it start to run down my 
                         neck...
                              (he turns his back to 
                              show her)
                         ...and down my back... right into my 
                         pants.

               Carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between 
               his shoulder blades and along his back.

                                     EARLY
                         ...and everything starts stickin' 
                         together... keeps running down the 
                         back of my legs like two rivers racin' 
                         for my boots, see who gets there 
                         first.

               He snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his 
               ass. She diverts her glance.

                                     EARLY
                         You never get that hot, huh?

               Carrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see 
               that his ice cube has melted.

                                     CARRIE
                         I gotta get back before this ice 
                         melts.

               Carrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the 
               machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice 
               cube. His face only inches from hers.

                                     EARLY
                         ...never?

                                     CARRIE
                         No, never. Excuse me.

               He pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.

                                     EARLY
                         You like Skynard?

               No response, Early chews up the ice cube.

               EXT. LINCOLN LEAVING THE MOTEL - NEXT MORNING

               The car crawls out of the parking lot.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Carrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover. 
               There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie 
               from the argument the night before. Early is in the back 
               with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans.

                                     ADELE
                         My daddy always took sauerkraut juice 
                         and tobasco sauce for a hangover, 
                         mixed in one egg not two, and some 
                         tomato juice...

               From the front seat, Brian's hand springs up in a desperate 
               plea for an end to Adele's colorful description.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm okay, thanks.

               Brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car 
               pulls away.

               EXT. LINCOLN ON HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

               THE CAR IS HEADING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Carrie glances over at Brian, who is now asleep next to her. 
               She looks up into her rear-view mirror...

               CARRIE'S POV: IN THE MIRROR

               Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging 
               through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her. 
               Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's 
               attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again. 
               The next instant, unexpectedly...

               EXT. LINCOLN

               She furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Brian's heads bangs against the side window.

                                     BRIAN
                         What! What!

               Carrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele 
               looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles.

                                     BRIAN
                         What is it?

                                     CARRIE
                         Look again!

               Brian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic 
               pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's 
               eyes open.

               EXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER

               A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is 
               broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian 
               how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old 
               car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of 
               shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.

                                     EARLY
                         Only thing my old man ever gave me 
                         is that goddamn .45.

               Brian fires off another shot, misses again.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri', you're jerkin' it when you 
                         pull the trigger, hold it real steady.

               Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of 
               her pocket.

                                     ADELE
                         Boys'll be boys.

               Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.

                                     ADELE
                         You know any tricks?

               Carrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer.

                                     ADELE
                         You wanna learn some?

               Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian.

               ON EARLY AND BRIAN

               Early helps Brian to hold the gun.

                                     EARLY
                         Steady... Breath in... now let half 
                         of it out, and... fire.

               BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie 
               to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to 
               the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow 
               after her... But Early grabs his attention.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri, I want you to keep this gun... 
                         consider it a present. Never know, 
                         California could turn out to be a 
                         dangerous place.

               Brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand.

               EXT. AN EMPTY HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Lincoln rolling along.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Brian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror 
               she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She 
               watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making 
               out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another.

               EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR ABATTOIR - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In 
               the distance, we see a large rundown building.

               INT. AN OLD DESERTED ABATTOIR - AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian 
               glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele 
               and sees that they are amorously engaged.

               Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens 
               the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the 
               .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the 
               glove compartment.

                                     EARLY
                         Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little 
                         sleepy,... think Adele and me are 
                         gonna take us a fiesta.

                                     CARRIE
                              (pissed off)
                         Siesta.

               Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, 
               locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she 
               and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the 
               structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele 
               leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white 
               top starts to come up.

               INT. ABATTOIR

               Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building 
               is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last 
               rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. 
               The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat-
               hooks hanging from the ceiling.

               Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet 
               and uncommunicative.

               NEW ANGLE

               CLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest 
               on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. 
               Brian pops a cassette in the player.

                                     CARRIE
                         What's that?

                                     BRIAN
                         A copy of a tape they found. He 
                         recorded everything.

               Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the 
               fact that this place repels her.

               Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The 
               small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we 
               slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman 
               being tortured and pleading for her life.

               FLASH!! FLASH!!

               Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. 
               Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams 
               from the audio tape bounce off the walls.

                                     BRIAN

                              hand held tape 
                              recorder)
                         His mother had him working in here 
                         before he was eight years old... 
                         killing animals with a sledgehammer 
                         that was bigger than he was.

               Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into 
               another room.

                                     BRIAN
                         When she was pissed at him, she'd 
                         beat the shit out of him and lock 
                         him in here overnight...

               The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady 
               whimpering.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing)
                         ...Eventually the boy wakes up one 
                         morning, picks up that sledgehammer 
                         and starts hurting back.

               FLASH!! FLASH!!

               Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then 
               she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. 
               Brian follows after her.

                                     BRIAN
                         There's more...

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm finished.

               Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look... I know you're pissed off 
                         about the gun, and I don't blame 
                         you...

               Carrie wheels around to face him.

                                     CARRIE
                         Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm 
                         it, turn that thing off.

               She switches off the cassette player.

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm scared. A week ago you would 
                         never have even thought to pick up 
                         that gun. This afternoon you're out 
                         there wielding it around like Clyde 
                         fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! 
                         What's with you?

                                     BRIAN
                         Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was 
                         stupid, I admit it, alright?
                              (pause)
                         But let's not blow this. Not now... 
                         Let's just get the photos.

                                     CARRIE
                         I can't believe I agreed to do this.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh come on, don't give me that shit... 
                         you wanted to take these photos as 
                         much as I wanted you too.

                                     CARRIE
                         Wrong! I was willing to do whatever 
                         it took to get you up off your ass 
                         and on the way to California... 
                         There's a big difference.

               Carrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and 
               makes her way toward...

               THE LINCOLN

               As she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... 
               Early and Adele fucking wildly!

               Carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. 
               Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on 
               them.

               THROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE

               Early is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling 
               him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button.

               Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press 
               up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's 
               finger presses down on the button, CLICK!!

               Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back 
               seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... 
               Talking dirty to Adele.

               Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through 
               a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the 
               motor drive once all the film is shot out.

               Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at 
               Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele.

               A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. 
               She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's 
               arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him.

                                     CARRIE
                         Brian I want him out of our car!

                                     BRIAN
                         Why, what did he do?

                                     CARRIE
                         Brian get him out of the car. Next 
                         gas station either he leaves or I 
                         do!

               EXT. DESERT - DUSK

               The Lincoln passes through frame. In the background, the 
               surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie 
               artificial light.

               INT. LINCOLN PULLS INTO A GAS STATION - TWILIGHT

               An electrical storm is in full swing.

               EXT. GAS STATION

               The Lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before Carrie 
               storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station 
               interior. She leaves Brian to break the news to Adele and 
               Early.

               INT. GAS STATION

               The only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's 
               watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV 
               we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying 
               because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception.

                                     CARRIE
                         Twenty dollars in the tank and a 
                         carton of cigarettes.

               In fact, each time the lightning flashes occur all of the 
               electrical power at the station is affected. The fluorescent 
               lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter 
               sporadically.

                                     NEWSMAN

               Static.

               Carrie looks at the TV, watches for a moment. It doesn't 
               hold her attention. She looks away and notices Adele leaving 
               the car. Adele walks toward a Coke machine at the other end 
               of the gas station.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Here's your cigarettes...

               Carrie turns back toward him.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         ...And change. Better be careful, 
                         looks like a bad one coming. Where 
                         you headin'?

                         Hear it never rains there. Must be 
                         nice.

               He buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to 
               gas up the Lincoln. Carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from 
               the carton, nervously lights one up. She looks out the window 
               toward the Lincoln.

               EXT. GAS PUMPS

               Through flashes of lightning and thunder she sees Brian in 
               the car talking to Early. Early listening quietly. Brian 
               looking adamant yet apologetic. The attendant fills the 
               Lincoln's tank.

               INT. GAS STATION

               Simultaneously, as Carrie watches this... Behind her on the 
               TV screen... A wave of interference scrambles the picture.

               EXT. GAS PUMPS - TIGHTER ON LINCOLN

               Brian's still talking -- using his hands to explain. Early 
               is watching him with a resigned expression.

               INT. GAS STATION - ON THE TV

               A video tape image of a familiar gas station recorded by a

               NEW ANGLE ON CARRIE

               She stares at the TV with growing horror as she notices a 
               familiar black Lincoln in the background. In mid-ground, a 
               male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly. Slowly, 
               Early's image becomes visible.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         If you see this man...

               Carrie panics, turns toward the door and runs smack into the 
               arms of a dripping wet Early Grayce! Early stares at her and 
               drops his bag to the ground.

                                     EARLY

               Then... Early notices himself on the TV.

                         ...call your local police or FBI...

               Static.

               Early grabs Carrie around the neck and yanks her into the 
               back office. He pushes her down onto a chair.

                                     EARLY
                         You just sit there and keep your 
                         mouth shut.

               He searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed-off 
               shotgun. He shuts the TV off.

               The Attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain. Early 
               points the sawed-off shotgun at him.

                                     EARLY
                         Get over here.

               Early forces him into the office.

                                     EARLY
                         Sit your ass down in that corner.

               Adele enters the adjacent room. She checks out the various 
               vending machines in search of candy. Early taps on the window 
               and motions her into the office. She sees Carrie in the chair, 
               scared to death, and Early aiming the gun at the Attendant.

                                     ADELE
                         Early, what're you doin'?

                                     EARLY
                         Go back to the car and keep Brian 
                         there. I don't want him in here...

               Adele looks back at Carrie, then hurries out. Early empties 
               the cash register.

                                     EARLY

                         Walter. How do you feel about that?

                         Shut your mouth.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele opens the door on the driver's side looking scared. 
               Brian is in the passenger seat. He's looking in the glove 
               compartment for a map. The .45 automatic Early gave Brian is 
               clearly visible. Adele stares at it.

                                     BRIAN
                         Adele, what are you doing back here?

               Adele gets in and starts looking under the seats.

                         ...Lost my purse... Could you help 
                         me look for it? It's probably under 
                         the seat.

               The Attendant is reaching up, handing Early the money from 
               his pockets. Carrie is seated in front of him.

                                     EARLY
                         Turkey's are real smart. Smarter 
                         than most people think...

               Early rips the phone out of the wall.

                                     EARLY
                         Tell you what Walter, you lie down 
                         there now... You make sure you stay 
                         put for a while after we leave... 
                         Okay?

               The attendant nods yes.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         ...Mind if I hold that Bible?

                                     EARLY
                         What do you need a Bible for?

               The attendant has no response.

                                     EARLY
                         You think I'm goin' to kill you. 
                         Well that'd make me a liar then 
                         wouldn't it?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         No sir.

               Early takes the Bible off the desk and hands it down to the 
               Attendant.

                                     EARLY
                         Here you go.

               The frightened young man lies face down on his stomach 
               clutching the Bible and starts to pray.

               On the counter next to him Early notices a large stuffed 
               "happy face" display. "Free with every 20 gallon purchase."

               He grabs one, stares at its face curiously.

                                     EARLY
                              (mumbles to himself)
                         I wonder if Adele would like one of 
                         these?
                              (beat)
                         Nah...

               Suddenly... He puts the barrel of the gun between the "happy 
               face" eyes... Points it at the back of the attendant's head.

               Carrie begins to scream. Early pulls the trigger.

               The blast explodes the "happy face" and rips into the back 
               of the Attendant's head, killing him.

               INT. LINCOLN - SIMULTANEOUSLY

               A thunderous crackle of lightning all but masks the gunshot. 
               The rain starts pouring down.

                                     BRIAN
                         What was that?

               Adele stares blankly back.

               INT. GAS STATION

               The room fills with billowing down stuffing. As the stuffing 
               floats to the floor it sticks to their hair, skin and 
               clothes...

                                     EARLY
                              (surprised at the 
                              feathers)
                         What the fuck!

               INT. LINCOLN

               Brian opens the door to leave.

               EXT. GAS STATION

               Early drags Carrie out of the office toward the car. Brian 
               sees them running toward the car. They spill into the back 
               seat. Brian sees Carrie is upset.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie, what's wrong?
                              (to Early)
                         Early, we went through this already, 
                         you have to leave.

               From the back seat Early wipes some more feathers from his 
               face, then points the Attendant's gun at Brian's head.

                                     EARLY
                              (spits out a feather)
                         'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele.

               Adele starts the car. She pulls out of the station and into 
               the rainstorm.

               INT. GAS STATION

               The last of the feathers fall like snow. The whole room is 
               now white except for a red stain around the head of the dead 
               Attendant.

               INT. LINCOLN - A MOMENT LATER

               The car moves down the highway. Early in the back seat is 
               still trying to brush away feathers.

                                     EARLY
                         Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm 
                         gonna have to ask for my gun back.

               Brian reaches in the glove compartment. He removes the gun 
               and hands it to Early.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Early)
                         What happened back there?

               Carrie sits in the corner of the back seat, covered in 
               feathers but not even noticing them.

                                     CARRIE
                         He shot him in the head... oh God!

               Adele turns to the back of the car to face Carrie.

                                     ADELE
                              (raising her voice)
                         He did not, you liar. Take that back.

               The Lincoln swerves off onto the side of the road. Adele 
               looks to the front again and steers it back onto the highway.

                                     CARRIE
                         He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking 
                         insane.

                                     EARLY
                         Everybody just shut up!

               Early picks some more feathers off himself.

                                     EARLY
                         You two just cooperate and do what I 
                         say, and we'll all arrive safe and 
                         sound in California, as planned... 
                         unless, of course, Adele don't kill 
                         us first with her driving.

               NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU

               The St. Christopher statue swings from the rear-view mirror. 
               The windshield wipers sweep back and forth against the pouring 
               rain.

               EXT. AN ISOLATED ABANDONED STORE - NEXT MORNING

               The Lincoln pulls up at the rear of the store. Adele exits 
               carrying a couple of bags of Chinese take-out food.

               INT. ABANDONED STORE

               Adele enters the decrepit store. The others are inside. Brian 
               and Carrie are tied up. Brian watches Early intently as he 
               takes one of the bags from Adele. He begins opening one of 
               the carry out containers.

                                     EARLY
                         What the hell is this stuff?

                                     ADELE
                         It's Chinese food. It was the only 
                         place open. You said you was starving, 
                         you'd eat anyth...

               Early opens another container. Stares curiously at the 
               contents.

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah but, what is it?

                                     ADELE
                         I don't know, they didn't speak too 
                         good English.

               Early sets the container down.

                                     EARLY
                         And just what exactly are the Chinese 
                         doing here in the middle of the 
                         American desert anyway?... Didja get 
                         the beer?

               Adele somewhat reluctantly hands Early a bottle of beer from 
               a second bag.

                                     EARLY
                         ..."Chink" beer!

               Early notices that Brian is watching him intently. He mistakes 
               Brian's interest for hunger.

                                     EARLY
                         Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey, 
                         untie Brian, he's starving over there.
                              (pause)
                         Carrie, you want some?

               Carrie doesn't respond at all. Adele unties Brian.

               Early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him. 
               Brian sits across from Early. He watches as Early rummages 
               impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.

                                     EARLY
                         Where's the damn forks and spoons 
                         at!

               Frustrated, Early finally takes a gulp of Chinese food right 
               out of the container. It goes down rough.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Is it just me, or has this whole 
                         trip been goin' downhill ever since 
                         we ran outta Lucky Lager?

               Brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts 
               them back down and, like Early, gulps from the container.

               NEARBY, Carrie sits quietly. As she listens to the two men 
               talk... she notices something on her arm. She lifts her arm 
               up to get a closer look.

               HER POV

               She sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling 
               to her. Closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers 
               is tinged with blood. The Gas Station Attendant's. It freaks 
               her.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

                                     BRIAN
                              (quietly)
                         How many people have you killed Early?

               Early stops... thinks for a moment.

               ON CARRIE

               She tries to brush the bloodied feather away... but with her 
               hands bound, she can't reach it.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

                                     EARLY
                         Well now, how many people d'you see 
                         me kill?

               Brian shakes his head.

                                     BRIAN
                         None.

               ON CARRIE

               In quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and 
               blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

               Early stares at Brian.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Well then, that's how many I 
                         killed.

                                     BRIAN
                              (unconvincingly)
                         If you say so.

                                     EARLY
                         Damn right I do.

               ON ADELE

               Adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

               Early picks up a different container and gulps some down. 
               After a moment...

                                     EARLY
                         You never killed anyone have you 
                         Bri'?

               Brian shakes his head no.

                                     EARLY
                         You never even seen anybody killed, 
                         right?

               Brian stops eating and looks at Early.

                                     BRIAN
                         What are you getting at?

               Early leans closer to him.

                                     EARLY
                         You wanna tell me how'n the hell you 
                         gonna write a book 'bout somethin' 
                         you don't know nothin' 'bout?

               Eye to eye, the two men stare at one another. Brian has no 
               answer.

                                     EARLY
                         Ya see what I'm sayin'?
                              (beat)
                         Ha!

                                     BRIAN
                              (nervously mimes the 
                              same)
                         ...Ha.

               Early goes back to gulping down his dinner. This time he 
               gets a spicy one.

                                     EARLY
                              (a nod toward the 
                              carry out container)
                         ...watch out for that stuff, it bites.

               Brian gazes at the cluster of Chinese carry-out food 
               containers. An ironic reminder of an earlier conversation. 
               He lets out a weak ironic laugh.

                                     BRIAN
                              (recollecting to 
                              himself)
                         ...way too much MSG.

               EXT. LINCOLN - TRAVELING - DAY

               INT. LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN BACKROADS - DAY

               Early is behind the wheel, not a care in the world. Adele 
               sits beside him playing with her camera. She turns and aims 
               the camera at Brian and Carrie in the back seat, their hands 
               are bound.

                                     ADELE
                         Smile.

               Neither makes any attempt at smiling. Adele snaps their photo 
               anyway. In the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment 
               then leans over to Early and whispers something to him.

                                     EARLY
                         No way. I guarantee you he was 
                         breathing when I walked outta there.

               Adele sits back quietly. Carrie wants to speak but doesn't.

                                     EARLY
                         Hey... Ain't we getting near the 
                         next murder site... Bri?

                                     BRIAN
                         Forget about it, doesn't matter.

                                     EARLY
                         Hell it don't...
                              (beat)
                         ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. 
                         One day I'm gonna pass some store 
                         and see your book in the window. Me 
                         and Adele gonna buy a copy for our 
                         coffee table.

               NEW ANGLE

               Carrie silently fuming in the back seat. Brian stares at the 
               rope that binds his wrists.

               EXT. OLD DESERTED MINE AREA - LATER THAT DAY

               The Lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops. They 
               all get out, Early unties Brian and Carrie.

                                     EARLY
                         Figured your hands might be starting 
                         to hurt.

               Early looks down the hill to the old mine building.

                                     EARLY
                         Let's have a look. You girls coming?

               Carrie's steely gaze answers Early's question.

                                     ADELE
                         Can I just wait here?

               Early leans into the car and picks up Adele's camera.

                                     EARLY
                         Don't worry Bri', I'll take the 
                         pictures.
                              (to Adele, with a 
                              kiss to her cheek)
                         ...you stay here with Carrie.
                              (to Carrie)
                         You run off... Bri' pays the price. 
                         Karma, remember?

               Pistol in hand, Early follows Brian down the hill. Adele 
               begins nervously playing with her yoyo.

               Carrie watches as Brian and Early disappear around a bend in 
               the dirt road. Out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on 
               Adele's yoyo.

               Adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the 
               yoyo, controlling it. Until she's lost in it. A momentary 
               refuge.

                                     ADELE
                         This is called walk the dog.

               NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU

               A huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion. 
               Its string unraveling as it spins downward. Carrie pulls her 
               gaze away.

               CARRIE'S POV

               The desolate surrounding landscape, a bright blue sky, the 
               scrubbrush. And no one who can help them. Carrie turns and 
               looks over her shoulder down the hill.

               EXT. OLD MINE BUILDING

               The old mine building, rusted and deserted since the late 
               '20's.

                                     EARLY
                         So tell me... what happened here?

                                     BRIAN
                         Two brothers, prospectors, lived 
                         here. Up until a few years back.

               Flash! -- Early takes a photo with the Instamatic.

                                     EARLY
                              (coaxing)
                         ...and?

                                     BRIAN
                         They picked up hitchhikers... young 
                         men... and brought them back here.

               Early scans the grounds.

                                     EARLY
                         Where'd they do it?

               Reluctantly Brian leads Early toward the old mine building. 
               At the opening, Early hesitates.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri.

               Brian stops in his tracks.

               EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CLOSE UP

               Adele's yoyo skitters across the gravel road surface.

               EXT. OLD MINE BUILDING

               Brian turns back to Early.

                                     EARLY
                         This ain't going to give me 
                         nightmares, is it?

               EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CLOSE UP

               Then in a snap!... the yoyo recoils into Adele's palm.

               CARRIE'S POV

               A distant empty ribbon of road.

               ON CARRIE

               Her eyes searching for anyone who could help.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         This is one of my favorites... rock 
                         the cradle.

               INT. OLD MINE BUILDING

               Brian and Early are silhouetted against the dying sky. Flash!! 
               Early takes another photo.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...They asked them just before they 
                         were executed why they did it. They 
                         said "to be famous."
                              (beat)
                         Why do you do it?

               Flash!! Early takes a flash photo of Brian, momentarily 
               blinding him.

                                     EARLY
                         Do what Bri?

               Early moves slowly toward Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         We both know you didn't have to kill 
                         that gas station attendant.

               Brian's eyes dart nervously to the gun dangling in Early's 
               palm. Flash!

               EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CU

               In slow motion Adele's hands manipulate the yoyo and string.

               INT. OLD MINE BUILDING

                                     BRIAN
                         You wanted to.
                              (beat)
                         Why?

               Flash! Brian flinches. Early remains silent as he closes in 
               on Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         It make you feel good? Powerful?
                              (Flash!)
                         Superior, what? Come on Early, tell 
                         me something.
                              (Flash!)
                         Were you angry?

               Early's boot lands toe to toe with Brian's shoe.

                                     BRIAN
                              (tentative)
                         Who are you angry with Early... your 
                         mother, your father?

               Eye to eye, the two men stand there.

                                     EARLY
                         You want to know about my daddy, 
                         I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri...

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Carrie walks over to Adele at the car. Adele doesn't miss a 
               beat with her yoyo.

                                     CARRIE
                         Adele, listen to me... Early's sick; 
                         he should be in a hospital.

               Adele screws up the trick. She pulls the yoyo off her finger 
               and throws it in the back seat. She leans into the front 
               seat and cranks the radio up to the max. Closing her eyes, 
               she begins moving to the music, and tries to ignore Carrie.

                                     CARRIE

                         The police are after him, he's a 
                         murderer!

                         That's not true!

               NEW ANGLE

               A POLICE CAR pulls into frame, unnoticed by Carrie and Adele 
               in the background.

               INT. POLICE CAR

                                     MALE OFFICER
                         Let's take a look.

                                     FEMALE OFFICER
                         I'll call in the plate.

               The Male Officer exits, unlocking his holster. The Female 
               Officer picks up the police radio and calls in the license 
               plate number.

               EXT. LINCOLN NEAR MINE AREA

               The radio is blaring. Adele continues to dance despite 
               Carrie's pleas.

                                     CARRIE
                              (shouting)
                         ...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . 
                         I saw him kill that man.

                                     ADELE
                              (defensive)
                         Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't 
                         do that. I don't know why you're 
                         saying those things. You ain't my 
                         friend.

               With that, Adele stops her dancing and turns away from 
               Carrie... To see the Male Officer walking toward them.

                                     ADELE
                         Please don't say anything Carrie.

               The Male Officer continues toward them. It looks like he's 
               talking to them... but his voice is inaudible under the 
               deafening radio.

               NEW ANGLE: FAVORING THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS

               The Female Officer sticks her head out of the police car and 
               yells to her partner. He turns to listen.

                                     FEMALE OFFICER
                         We got a match, I'll call for back 
                         up.

               As the Male Officer turns back, he sees Adele reach into the 
               front seat of the Lincoln. The Male Officer draws his revolver 
               and levels it at Adele.

               NEW ANGLE: FAVORING ADELE AND CARRIE

               Click! Adele shuts the radio off, total silence. As Adele 
               leans back out of the car, she turns, facing directly into 
               the barrel of the Male Officer's gun.

                                     MALE OFFICER
                         All right ladies, I want both of you 
                         to slowly step away from the ca...

               BANG! A single gunshot rings out! The Male Officer jerks 
               back and falls to the ground. Adele screams! Carrie whips a 
               panicked glance around and sees... Early running toward them. 
               Brian, bewildered, follows behind.

               BRIAN'S POV (RUNNING)

               Ahead of him, he watches Early race past the wounded Male 
               Officer. He kicks the Officer's revolver out of reach and 
               rushes toward the police car.

               Early fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car!

               The Female Officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of 
               the car, when... a shot shatters the windshield hitting her 
               in the chest. She collapses back onto the seat.

               ON BRIAN

               He stops at the sight of the wounded Male Officer. Shocked, 
               he watches the man writhing in pain. His hands clutching his 
               crotch. His blood oozes into the dirt.

               Early approaches the police car. He sees the dead cop and 
               hears the radio dispatcher.

                                     POLICE RADIO
                         Officer needs help, shots fired, six 
                         Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects 
                         wanted in multiple murders. Location 
                         unknown, last seen...

               Brian is not sure what to do. He looks around... sees the 
               Officer's handgun lying in the dirt. He takes a step toward 
               it, when... another gunshot rings out! Brian stops. Looks to 
               the police car. He sees Early standing there, smoke belching 
               from the dashboard... the police radio is dead.

               Early walks back toward Brian and the others. He steps over 
               to the injured Male Officer on the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         Tell me that don't hurt.

               Early picks up the wounded cop's gun. He hands it to Brian 
               as he trains the .45 automatic at Brian's chest.

                                     EARLY
                         Shoot him. You'll be doing him a 
                         favor.

               Brian looks to Early in disbelief.

                         No, no, I can't.

               Early cocks the pistol and pushes the barrel to Brian's head. 
               Brian looks down at the wounded cop who is writhing in pain.

                                     EARLY
                         (No,) It's the answer to all them 
                         questions of yers.

               Brian won't do it. He drops the gun to the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         Now you'll never know.

               Early cocks his pistol.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Don't do it. Early, look at him, 
                         look at his face. That's not your 
                         father.

               Early stares at the wounded cop's face.

                                     EARLY
                         I know that. That there is a policeman 
                         in a world of pain. And this is what 
                         you call a mercy killin'.

               Early shoots the cop again. The cop lays still.

               Early reaches down and takes the dead cop's handcuffs. He 
               casually points the little camera at the dead cop. Flash!!

               EXT. LINCOLN - ON BACKROADS - LATER

               The Lincoln hurtles down the road.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Early driving. Adele in the passenger seat looks bewildered. 
               Carrie and Brian in back, handcuffed, eyes hollow with 
               exhaustion and fear. Then out of the quiet...

                                     EARLY
                         I'm still waiting.

               Adele looks across the seat to Early. Her face drained of 
               all expression.

                                     EARLY
                              (disappointed)
                         Not so much as a simple "thank you."

               Adele at a loss. Finally... confused...

                                     ADELE
                              (empty)
                         ...thank you.

                                     EARLY
                         Thank you for what?
                              (becoming aggravated)
                         What are you thanking me for Adele?

                                     ADELE
                              (hesitantly, she admits)
                         ...I don't know.

                                     EARLY
                         Well Adele... it was for...
                              (screaming at her)
                         ...saving your fucking life back 
                         there!

               She shrinks away from him.

                                     EARLY
                              (gesturing with his 
                              fingertips a fraction 
                              apart)
                         Darlin' you were 'bout that far from 
                         spendin' the night at the morgue. 
                         You understand?

                                     CARRIE
                         He wasn't going to shoot her, you 
                         murdering son of a bitch!

               Early looks into the rear-view mirror. Brian tries to defuse 
               the situation.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie... stop it.

                                     CARRIE
                              (explodes)
                         What the fuck is wrong with you 
                         Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes 
                         for once and open your eyes... you'll 
                         see that he is a homicidal fucking 
                         killer. He is... for real!

                                     BRIAN
                         Shut up Carrie, please... just shut 
                         up!

               EXT. LINCOLN ON DESERTED HIGHWAY - SUNSET

               The Lincoln drives along an old deserted highway passing 
               occasional gas stations and dilapidated motels.

               INT. LINCOLN ON DESERTED HIGHWAY - SUNSET

               Early is driving. He notices something in the distance.

               EARLY'S POV - NIGHT

               Off in the distance... an oasis of greenery.

               EXT. THE MUSGRAVE HOUSE - ARIZONA/UTAH BORDER - DUSK

               A home in a secluded valley near the desert. It has a cactus 
               garden. The garden is illuminated so it can be enjoyed at 
               night.

               Reveal... the Lincoln parked by the front door.

               EXT. LINCOLN - CLOSER

               Adele gazes out the passenger-side window. She's enthralled 
               by the sight of all the cacti.

                                     ADELE
                         ...I luv' cactuses 'cos they're so 
                         strong. Don't need much care really.

               BRIAN'S POV

               Early steps up to the front door of the house and rings the 
               bell. Carrie stands beside him. A light comes on inside. The 
               door slides open a crack and MRS. MUSGRAVE, an attractive 
               older woman with silver hair, peers out with a puzzled look.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Adele rambles on.

                              (far away)
                         ...You can forget about 'em forever

                         doin' even better than before.

                                     BRIAN
                              (watching the house)
                         Adele... we gotta do something before 
                         Early kills someone else.

               Of Early and Carrie as they are let into the house.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele is still rambling on about her interest in cacti.

                                     ADELE
                         ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. 
                         They can live for two even three 
                         hundred years.

                                     BRIAN
                         Adele for god sake please lis...

                                     ADELE
                              (she glances over to 
                              Brian)
                         There ain't nothing we could do. 
                         Once Early sets his mind on somethin', 
                         well thats the end of that.

               Adele drifts back to the cacti.

               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

               CLOSE ON A PORCELAIN CACTUS

               One of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle. 
               Adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus.

               Carrie and Brian sit on the floor, back to back, their arms 
               bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs. 
               Mrs. Musgrave is standing nearby. She's overwhelmed. Numb. 
               She pours herself a glass of bourbon.

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                              (to herself)
                         It's just like in that dream I had. 
                         If only I had seen their faces.

               She takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby. Adele 
               drops down quietly on the chair next to her.

                                     ADELE
                              (tries to cheer Mrs. 
                              Musgrave up)
                         You've got beautiful cactuses here, 
                         I just love 'em. My momma used to 
                         keep a garden.

               Mrs. Musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try. 
               Distressed, her head slumps down.

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                              (from the kitchen)
                         Hey Bri... You ever stop to think 
                         that if you switched the two letters 
                         in your name...
                              (entering the room)
                         ...it would spell Brain.

               Early, his pistol wedged in his belt, appears from the kitchen 
               eating a sandwich. Between bites... He walks over and rips 
               the phone out of the wall unit. He glimpses Mrs. Musgrave.

                                     EARLY
                         What's wrong with her?

                                     ADELE
                              (sorry for her)
                         She had a dream that somethin' like 
                         this was gonna happen.

               Early notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands. 
               He steps over to her and takes the glass away.

                                     EARLY
                         I'll bet she did.

               He sets the glass down next to a recent picture of Mrs. 
               Musgrave and an ELDERLY MAN with silver hair.

                                     EARLY
                         Where's your husband?

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                              (lying)
                         ...I'm a widow.

               Early looks at her, he doesn't believe her.

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Everything is quiet beneath the star studded sky. The same 
               elderly man pictured with Mrs. Musgrave is studying the sky 
               through a powerful telescope. MR. MUSGRAVE is an amateur 
               astronomer. o.s. the SOUND of a door opening. Then footsteps.

                                     MR. MUSGRAVE
                              (excited)
                         Is that you Peaches? Come, you must 
                         see Saturn tonight. The rings are 
                         sensational!

               INT. STUDY - GLASS DISPLAY CASE

               Early leans into frame, staring at the display case.

               EARLY'S POV

               Inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first ATOMIC 
               BOMB, "Fat Boy." Faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate 
               Mr. Musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial 
               construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much 
               younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen. He is laughing and 
               embracing a '50's style female mannequin.

                                     MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)
                         My oh my, this is quite rare, quite 
                         rare indeed. Come have a look...

               Early's eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in 
               the corner of the room.

               MR MUSGRAVE'S POV - THROUGH TELESCOPE

               The planet Saturn and its glorious rings.

                                     MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)
                         Peaches?

               OMITTED

               THWACK!! The planet turns into a blur of light... then 
               blackness.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - ON BRIAN AND CARRIE

               Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano, in the 
               background we see Mrs. Musgrave and Adele looking out the 
               window into the backyard.

                                     BRIAN
                              (whispers to Carrie)
                         You gotta talk to her. She looks up 
                         to you, she'll listen to you.

                                     CARRIE
                         I tried talking to her at the mine. 
                         It didn't work.

                                     BRIAN
                         Then try again, (it's our only 
                         chance.)

               EXT. HOUSE - LATER

               Early is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Early?

               He pulls his eye away as Adele arrives.

                                     ADELE
                              (excited)
                         Early, Mrs. Musgrave has the most 
                         beautiful little guest house out 
                         back and... well, no one's stayin' 
                         in it... it's just empty. And she 
                         said if me and you wanted to, well 
                         maybe we...

               Suddenly, o.s., a scream pierces the moment!

               Early and Adele turn toward the doorway to see Mrs. Musgrave 
               screaming. The older woman's eyes staring past Adele to the 
               floor nearby. Adele follows the terrified woman's gaze to 
               find... Mr. Musgrave's body lying on the floor. A bloodied 
               wound in the back of his head. All of Adele's enthusiasm 
               drains from her face.

                                     EARLY
                              (to Mrs. Musgrave)
                         Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow 
                         now.

               Mrs. Musgrave collapses to the floor.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER

               Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano. Across from 
               them, Early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through 
               Carrie's collection of erotic photography.

                                     EARLY
                              (to Brian)
                         Have you seen this one? That don't 
                         leave much to the imagination now 
                         does it?

               He looks at another photograph. Confused, he turns it upside 
               down, stares at it.

               INT. THE DEN - SAME TIME

               Mrs. Musgrave is laid out on the couch. Adele, deep in 
               thought, watches over the older woman. Finally Adele reaches 
               into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks 
               across the room to a table. Its top is covered with small 
               potted cacti. She gently places hers among them.

               ON MRS. MUSGRAVE

               Mrs. Musgrave begins to regain consciousness. Her eyes open 
               to find... Adele standing over her. Adele brings her finger 
               to her lips -- Shhhh.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Early looks through several more photos. He stops on one of 
               a nude woman's torso. Early looks at it for a moment... then 
               extends the photo out toward Carrie, comparing it to her.

                                     EARLY
                              (smiles and shakes 
                              his head in disbelief)
                         That's you ain't it?

               Carrie doesn't answer him. Then, in the background directly 
               behind Early... Adele and Mrs. Musgrave quietly appear. Carrie 
               notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the 
               kitchen. Early sees Carrie's eyes glance past him. He turns 
               to see why... when...

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         You're right Early...

               Early stops. Looks back to Carrie. Brian also turns to her 
               curiously.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...It is me. Do you like it?

               Early looks at the photo again. Adele and Mrs. Musgrave now 
               cross safely to the kitchen. Carrie eyes meet Early's. He 
               smiles, pulls the nude photo of her close to his face... and 
               licks it.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Adele quietly opens the back door.

                                     ADELE
                         Go on now... please.

               Mrs. Musgrave is confused, is it a trick? She looks into 
               Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and 
               walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open 
               door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape.

                                     ADELE
                              (in a whisper)
                         ...Call me.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Early finishes looking through the photographs. He closes 
               the cover of the portfolio.

                                     EARLY
                         Well they say there's room fur all 
                         kinds in California... and that's 
                         where we're gonna be this time 
                         tomorrow. California.
                              (beat)
                         Adele honey?

               INT. KITCHEN

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                         Adele?

               Early enters, and sees Adele standing at the back door. Adele 
               turns to face him. Early looks past her into the night and 
               realizes what she's done. He strides across the room pulling 
               the pistol from his waistband.

               AT THE KITCHEN DOOR

               Early pushes Adele out of the way.

                                     EARLY
                              (shouting)
                         Peaches! Come on back here. There 
                         ain't nothin' for you to be afraid 
                         of.

               EARLY POV - EXT. CACTUS GARDEN

               Aside from the occasional pools of light illuminating the 
               cacti, it's very dark. There's no sign of Mrs. Musgrave.

               INT. KITCHEN

               He steps outside and starts firing his gun into the 
               blackness... bullets THUNK into the cacti.

                                     EARLY
                              (shouting over the 
                              gunfire)
                         Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!

                                     ADELE
                         Early! Stop!!

               Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes 
               toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she 
               pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, 
               disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the 
               kitchen door, bewildered. Then...

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                         Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!

               Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when 
               she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the 
               cactus ripped the flesh.

                                     EARLY
                              (perplexed)
                         Honey... What do you think you're 
                         doin'?

               Adele starts to cry.

                                     EARLY
                         Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 
                         'bout? I'm the one got hit.

                                     ADELE
                         I changed my mind, Early. I'm not 
                         gonna climb up that Hollywood sign 
                         with you... I decided. I think your 
                         mean, and you hurt people.

               A look comes over Early's face that we've never seen before. 
               That he's never felt before. Hurt. He doesn't know how to 
               deal with it. And he definitely doesn't like it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE)

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie, watch for Early.

                                     CARRIE
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm going to try and lift the end of 
                         the piano. If I can... slide your 
                         cuffs free.

               Carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses 
               his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his 
               strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. 
               Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.

                                     CARRIE
                         What about you?

                                     BRIAN
                         I don't know.

               Carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices 
               a chair nearby.

                                     CARRIE
                         Can you lift it again? Just lift it, 
                         hurry.

               Carrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes 
               the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano 
               suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor 
               and slips the cuffs free.

               When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.

               A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's 
               pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees 
               Brian and Carrie standing.

                                     EARLY
                         You two been busy in here.

                                     BRIAN
                         What happened to Adele?

                                     EARLY
                         Well, let's put it this way.
                              (beat)
                         I need me a new woman.

               A shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another. 
               Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian 
               rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face!

                                     EARLY
                         Sorry about this Bri...

               He starts to squeeze the trigger.

                                     CARRIE
                              (desperate)
                         Early, don't.

               Early stops. He looks to Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         I'll do whatever you want. You want 
                         me to go with you, I'll go with you. 
                         Just don't kill him.

               Early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the 
               trigger... and smiles to Brian.

               Then, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the 
               butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor 
               unconscious.

               OMITTED

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               As Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little 
               Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of 
               beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides 
               into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is 
               now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses.

                                     EARLY
                         Think anyone will notice?

               Carrie doesn't answer, Early laughs.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Early looks out over the expanse of the desert. He sees a 
               dirt fire road.

                                     EARLY
                         I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... 
                         save us some time.

               Carrie doesn't understand what he means. Nonetheless, she 
               nods her head in agreement.

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE

               The Lincoln heads out, past the cactus garden, into the 
               darkness.

               THE LINCOLN'S HEADLIGHTS REVEAL

               Adele's lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti.

               FADE TO BLACK WITH THE DEPARTING HEADLIGHTS

               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               Brian is handcuffed on the floor. His eyes open slowly as he 
               begins to regain consciousness. He senses someone behind 
               him. He pivots around to see Mrs. Musgrave kneeling down to 
               help him.

               EXT. DESERT - SAME TIME

               In the distance, a cloud of dust reveals the Lincoln, 
               traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Early still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the 
               passenger side door. She is tense and guarded. Out the window, 
               nothing but empty desert.

                                     EARLY
                         Pass me a beer hon'.

               Carrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and 
               reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and 
               pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she 
               hesitates a moment...

               NEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR

               Early watches Carrie.

                                     EARLY
                         You wanna hit me with that, huh?

               NEW ANGLE

               Carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the 
               front seat.

                                     CARRIE
                              (not looking at him)
                         No.

               She hands the bottle to him. Early reaches out for the beer, 
               but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers.

               He looks at her and begins to squeeze...

                                     EARLY
                         Stop lyin'... I can see right through 
                         you.

               Early squeezes even harder -- Carrie begins to wince with 
               pain. She waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand.

                                     EARLY
                         Who d'ya think you're foolin'?
                              (beat)
                         I know you better than you think...

                                     CARRIE
                              (confused)
                         ...You're hurting me...

               Early hits the brakes. The car screeches to a halt in a cloud 
               of dust. Early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins 
               to drag her toward him.

                                     EARLY
                         I seen the way you been lookin' at 
                         me since we met... Snappin' my photo 
                         when you thought I wasn't lookin'. 
                         Wanting me...

               Carrie turns her head away. Early pulls her closer.

                                     EARLY
                         I saw you when I killed that boy...

               He grabs her hair with his other hand... Pulls her head around -- 
               forcing her to look at him. Early has Carrie right up against 
               him, looking right into her eyes.

                                     EARLY
                              (whispers)
                         You were plenty hot.

                                     CARRIE
                              (explodes)
                         You sick twisted fuck! You don't 
                         know shit about me.

               She struggles trying to free herself. Early, his face only 
               inches from hers, smiles...

                                     EARLY
                         Sick... some people might say takin' 
                         photos of me and Adele humpin' in 
                         the back of the car is sick.

               Carrie struggles even harder, but Early tightens his hold.

                                     EARLY
                         ...You know what I mean?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...I know I'd love to smash this 
                         bottle right in your fucking face.

               Suddenly... Early releases Carrie, taking the beer from her. 
               Carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side.

                                     EARLY
                         That's better... Honesty... I like 
                         that in a woman.

               He gives her a grin, then opens the bottle.

                                     EARLY
                         But I'll tell ya... when we get to 
                         California, we're gonna have to do 
                         something 'bout that gutter mouth of 
                         yours.

               Early takes a gulp of beer.

               EXT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Early throws the bottle of beer out the window (it ain't 
               Lucky Lager), slams the Lincoln into "drive" and accelerates 
               along the dirt road.

               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                         He's pulled out all the lines. The 
                         nearest phone is twenty miles east 
                         of here.

               Brian notices an old pickup truck parked outside.

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - THE NEXT MOMENT

               An anxious Brian hustles into the cab of the pickup truck. 
               Some tools are in the back. Brian still wears the handcuffs 
               around his wrists. Mrs. Musgrave stands near the front door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Which way did they go?

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                              (pointing)
                         He took the fire road.

                                     BRIAN
                         Take your car and get to that phone. 
                         Call the police.

               Brian starts the pickup and drives off.

               EXT. DESERT - LATER

               The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire 
               road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. 
               The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier.

               The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan 
               the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie 
               reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word, 
               reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up 
               and throws it out the window.

               NEW ANGLE

               Carrie's eyes go to the instrument panel. The temperature 
               gauge is in the red.

               EXT. DESERT

               The pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt. 
               Brian tries to guess which direction to take. Then he spots 
               Early's discarded beer bottle up ahead. The truck accelerates 
               straight ahead, tires spinning.

               EXT. DESERT - LATER, THE SUN IS ON THE HORIZON

               The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. 
               The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is 
               streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view.

               Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to 
               a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln 
               has had it.

               Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards 
               away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 
               1950's style building.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Early opens the back door. He grabs a box of supplies (some 
               rope, a kerosene lamp etc.)

                                     EARLY
                         Come on.

               Carrie slowly begins to respond. She slides across the front 
               seat.

               NEW ANGLE: CLOSE ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL

               Carrie's hand crosses frame and pulls out a knob on the dash.

               EXT. DESERT - LATE AFTERNOON

               The sun is starting to set behind a distant mountain range. 
               In the far distance... The pickup truck, revealed by its 
               trail of dust, crosses the vast landscape.

               EXT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE

               Early and Carrie struggle through the growing sand storm. 
               Carrie throws a last curious glance back to the Lincoln as 
               they reach the front door.

               INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE

               The front door is kicked open. Early enters the room with 
               Carrie in tow.

               CLOSE ON EARLY

               He looks around the room... A smile forms on his face.

                                     EARLY
                         Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and 
                         this is my girl Carrie. I hope you 
                         don't mind us bargin' in like this 
                         but a... we was on our way to 
                         California when our car broke down, 
                         and...

               EARLY'S POV (AS HE EXPLAINS)

               A living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. Sand covers 
               everything... Including...

               A FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father 
               sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as 
               in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen 
               counter... The little girl is seated at a table... The little 
               boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor.

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                         Well... it's gettin' pretty rough 
                         out there, so if it's all the same 
                         to you, we'll be staying the night.

               EXT. '50'S HOUSE

               Early slams the front door shut.

               CAMERA PULLS AWAY - REVEALING

               The building is a single story '50's home of extremely cheap 
               construction. It's in bad condition.

               EXT. DESERT - THE SMASHED WOODEN GATE

               The last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck 
               heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate. The 
               pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the Lincoln.

               NEW ANGLE

               On a collapsed old wooden sign. It lies on the ground a few 
               feet away from the gate posts.

               "DREAMLAND" - NUCLEAR TEST RANGE DANGER - KEEP OUT

               INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. 
               A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room 
               area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the 
               waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the 
               knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on 
               some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared 
               to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere.

               Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed 
               about the room.

               ON EARLY

               Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one 
               on the side.

               With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... 
               To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. 
               Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he 
               begins to move toward her. The time has arrived.

               He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her 
               feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses 
               her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She 
               seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, 
               until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward 
               crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around 
               his neck and kisses him deep and hard...

               Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard 
               across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, 
               the palm of her right hand is bleeding.

               Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass 
               protruding from his side.

               He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and 
               onto his jeans.

               Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically 
               looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two 
               adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, 
               intertwined in a grotesque sexual position.

               Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts 
               her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her 
               over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she 
               stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the 
               mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.

                                     EARLY
                              (friendly)
                         You'll like it...

               A violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos 
               swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across 
               Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily.

                                     EARLY
                         Not a lot, but you'll like it.

               Early peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound 
               covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall. 
               It sticks. He walks toward her.

               INT. PICKUP TRUCK - BRIAN'S POV

               The high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. 
               Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of 
               the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road 
               ahead and the swirling sand.

               He passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE'

               Then... As the pickup truck comes around a corner Suddenly... 
               directly in front of him -- Headlights!!

               Brian reacts... too late!!

               The pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle, and tumbles end 
               over end through the open desert, before finally coming to 
               an abrupt halt.

               INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT

               With each thrust of Early's body, Carrie's badly bruised 
               face contorts with pain and hatred

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT

               Sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked 
               pickup truck. Brian is upside down with his eyes shut. A 
               trickle of blood runs down his face. Camera booms up a dirt 
               slope to reveal the Lincoln, beyond it on the hill above 
               sits the desert house. The glow of the kerosene lamp is 
               visible through the windows.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DESERT HOUSE - DAWN

               The storm is over... No sand blowing. No wind. No nothing.

               COMPLETE SILENCE!!!!

               The dawn light reveals the devastated '50's house to be one 
               of a cluster, set at the end of a 'Doom Town' cul-de-sac.

               INT. '50'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

               In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles 
               atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the 
               bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In 
               the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand.

               Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in 
               one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45 
               automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.

               As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, 
               his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment.

               EARLY'S POV

               A blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps 
               around the front door frame... It looks like a magical "door" 
               shrouded in a wall of light!

               ON EARLY

               In disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and 
               sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... 
               the morning sun rising. With that he turns his attention 
               back to the front door!

                                     EARLY
                         I knew there was doors out here!

               He walks toward the doorway of light. He grins as he opens 
               the "door" and steps through it. The sunlight momentarily 
               blinding him.

               EARLY'S POV

               A black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... 
               Eventually it blocks out all the light until... WHAAMM!!!!

               EXT. DOOR

               A blow knocks Early back through the doorway. He slams to 
               the ground, on his back. The gun falls from his jeans and 
               slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the 
               blood covered remains of his face, he tries to get up, but 
               can't.

               EARLY'S POV

               Brian, silhouetted, steps into the doorway. He holds a shovel 
               raised, ready to deliver a second, fatal blow... but when he 
               sees Early incapacitated on the floor, he lowers the shovel 
               to his side. His handcuffed hands reach down and picks up 
               Early's gun. He trains it on Early, then walks around him to 
               enter the house. Brian's eyes slowly adjust to the interior...

               EARLY'S POV

               From on his back, Early looks out the open "door." He sees 
               two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand, 
               reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes 
               that the glass, placed there by Brian, is what created the 
               effect of the "door." He starts to laugh.

                                     EARLY
                              (laughing)
                         That was damn tricky of you Bri.

               Brian searches for Carrie.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie... Carrie... it's over.

               ON BRIAN

               He moves into the back bedroom and finds Carrie. She is 
               crouched on the floor, handcuffed to the bedframe. He moves 
               to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised 
               face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night.

               Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes. 
               With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of 
               the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early. 
               in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the 
               room. He wields the pistol toward the ground where Early 
               lay... but Early's not there.

               Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from 
               behind him, Early grabs him!

               He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife 
               toward his throat!

               Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before 
               the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious 
               wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the 
               gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls 
               away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but 
               Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to 
               his knees.

                                     EARLY
                         Go ahead Bri, ask me something.
                              (beat)
                         You wanna know how I'm feeling'? 
                         Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn 
                         good.

               On all fours, Brian reaches out for the gun, but Early kicks 
               it across the room.

                                     EARLY
                         How 'bout you? You feelin' good?

               Another kick to Brian's chest. The wind rushes out of him.

                                     EARLY
                         ...'Cause you sure don't look so 
                         good.
                              (beat)
                         Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. 
                         That it, you feeling powerful? 
                         Superior? I know I am.

               Early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of Brian's face! 
               His head snaps back, his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls 
               flat to the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now 
                         why would I be angry with my daddy... 
                         you're the one hit me with the shovel. 
                         And you're the one's gonna wish you 
                         hadn't.

               With one last effort, Brian manages to pull himself back up 
               to his knees. He focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries 
               to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips 
               over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway. 
               Early moves toward him, knife in hand.

               As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the 
               doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past. 
               Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face. 
               Early stumbles backward.

               Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he 
               turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires. 
               Hitting Early square in the chest!

               Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself 
               to his feet.

               He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, 
               and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the 
               leg.

               Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. 
               Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain 
               around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. 
               Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's 
               arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt 
               collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that 
               Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm 
               drops back down to his side.

                                     EARLY
                         Hey Bri... I think I need a doctor. 
                         What d'ya say?

               The two men stare at one another for a moment... then Brian, 
               with one hand still on the handcuff keys, shoves the .45 
               automatic firmly under Early's chin.

               CLOSE ON BRIAN

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Sorry 'bout this Early.

               o.s. BANG!! rings out as...

               CLOSE UP on the chain and keys snapping free from Early's 
               neck.

               CLOSE UP on Brian's handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor.

               CLOSE UP on Carrie's handcuff swinging empty against the 
               rusty bedpost.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

OVER BLACK
We hear labored breathing.

QUOTE APPEARS:

                          best served cold"

                                         - Old Klingon Proverb -
QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;



                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Do you find me sadistic?

                                                       CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          I bet I could fry an egg on your
          head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
          now, you're aware enough to know
          there isn't a trace of sadism in
          my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
          these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
          at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

                                                    CUT TO:

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's my best friend from work
          Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's the minister. I think his
          name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

          name on his driver's license was
          Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
          some reason he preferred Arthur.
          Maybe if he went by Carles people
          would have called him Charlie. If
          that was his reason for going by
          Arthur I can understand it.
          Nothing wrong with the name
          Charlie, except he didn't look like
          a Charlie, he looked like an
          Arthur.
          Obviously you'll have to take my
          word on this. Speaking of names, I
          was about two seconds away from
          becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
          Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
          wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
          trying, I can tell you that.
          Actually Bill's last bullet put me
          in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
          for five years.
          When I woke up, ...I went on what
          the movie advertisements refer to
          as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
          roarded and I rampaged and I got
          bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
          killed 33 people to get to this
          piont right now.
          I have only one more.
          The last one.

          The one I'M driving to right now.
          The only one left.
          And when I arrive at my
          destination.....
          .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

                                           WE FADE TO BLACK

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:


                        "The city of
                   PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"


We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



                       FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
             Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



                       THE HOUSEWIFE
             Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



                        LITTLE GIRL
             Mommy, what happened to you and the
             T.V. Room?

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Oh, that good for nothin dog of
          yours, got his little ass in the
          living room and acted a damn fool,
          that's what happened.



                    LITTLE GIRL
          Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



                    THE    HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, you    can't come in here,
          there's broken    glass all over the
          floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          This is a old friend of mommy's I
          ain't seen in a long time.



                     THE BRIDE
          Hello sweety, I'm *(BLEEP)*, what's
          your name?

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Her name is Nikki.



                     THE BRIDE
          Nikki. What a pretty name for such
          a pretty little girl. How old are
          you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a
          question.



                    NIKKI
              (to The Bride)
          I'm four.



                       THE BRIDE
          Four years    old, aye. You know I
          once had a    little girl. She'd be
          five right    now. Maybe you two could
          of played    with each other.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, me an *(BLEEP)* have some
          grown-up talk to talk about, so you
          go in your room now and leave us
          alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
              (snapping her fingers)
          Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Want some coffee?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Cream and sugar?



                    THE BRIDE
          Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          This Pasadena homemaker's name is
          Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
          Lawrence Bell. But back when we
          were acquainted, five years ago,
          her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
          code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
          was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



                    THE BRIDE
          Were you expecting me?



                    VERNITA
          Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
          me right after you woke up, and
          then again a little later after
          your episode in Japan.
              (pause)
          So I suppose it's a little late for
          a apology, huh?



                    THE BRIDE
          You suppose correctly.



                    VERNITA
          Even if I was sincere?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh. I'm quite positive you're
          sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

                    VERNITA
          Look bitch, I need to know if
          you're gonna start anymore shit
          around my baby girl!



                    THE BRIDE
          You can relax for now. I'm not
          going to murder you in front of
          your daughter.



                    VERNITA
          That's being more rational than
          Bill led me to believe you were
          capable of.



                    THE BRIDE
          Well that's a demonstration of
          Bill's complete ignorance when it
          comes to the subject of me, and
          what I'm thinking, and what I might
          do. It's mercy, compassion, and
          forgiveness I lack, not
          rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
          for long. I'll allow you to choose
          a time and place for us to meet
          again, preferably as far away from
          Nikki as possible.
          I could have just HIT you, I
          didn't, I demand respect for that.
          Since this is not a HIT, consider
          it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
          Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
          of honor. One on one - no help - no
          bushwhackin - no treacherous
          weapons - on weapon of choice - our
          skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;



                      VERNITA
          *(BLEEP)*

                    THE BRIDE
          - I'm not through telling you.
          Failure to keep our date, or
          duplicity of any kind, will result
          in me putting a xoxo hollow point
          bullet into the back of your skull
          from a window of a building across
          the street from Nikki's elementary
          school. Now, feel free to respond.



                    VERNITA
          Look...I know I fucked you over. I
          fucked you over bad. I wish to God
          I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.



                    VERNITA
          If I could go back in a machine I
          would, but I can't. All I can tell
          you is I'm a different person now.



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't care.



                    VERNITA
          Be that as it may, I know I do not
          deserve mercy or forgiveness.
          However, I beseech you for both on
          behalf of my daughter.



                    THE BRIDE
          -- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).



                    THE BRIDE
              (leans in close)
          Just because I have no wish to
          murder you before the eyes of your
          daughter, does not mean parading
          her around in front of me is going
          to inspire sympathy. You and I have
          unfinished business.

          And not    a goddamn fuckin thing
          you've    done in the subsequent five
          years -    including getting knocked
          up - is    going to change that.



                    VERNITA
          You have every right to wanna get
          even --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- But that's where you're wrong,
          Vernita. I don't want to get even.
          To get even, even Steven. I would
          have to kill you, go into Nikki's
          room, kill her, then wait for your
          old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
          kill him. That would make us even.
          No, my unborn daughter will just
          hafta be satisfied with your death
          at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.



                    VERNITA
          When do we do this?



                     THE BRIDE
          It all depends... When do you want
          to die? Tomorrow? The day after
          tomorrow? That's about as long as
          I'll wait.



                    VERNITA
          How bout tonight, bitch?



                    THE BRIDE
          Spendid. Where?



                    VERNITA
          There's a baseball diamond where
          our little league has its games,
          about a mile from here. We meet
          there around two-thirty in the
          morning, dressed all in black, your
          hair in a black stocking, and we
          have us a knife fight, we won't be

          bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
          cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill said you were one of the best
          ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
          weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



                    VERNITA
          Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
          qualify it, so you can just kiss my
          motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
              (snorts to herself)
          Black Mamba, I shoulda been
          motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Weapon of choice? And if you want
          to stick with your butcher knife,
          I'm cool with that.



                    VERNITA
          Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



                       VERNITA
             Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
             don't...



                        THE BRIDE
             Do to your daughter, what you did
             to mine...
                 (she takes her hand)
             ...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



                       THE BRIDE
             It was not my intention to do this
             in front of you. For that I'm
             sorry. But you can take my word for
             it, your mother had it coming. When
             you grow up, if you still feel raw
             about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


                        DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;


                         VERNITA GREEN
                             COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

Although we're only in a tight CU, we can tell a few things:
one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three,
it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding
outside.



EXT. EL PASO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The wheel to an Alfa Romeo rolls into FRAME and stops.

The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the

She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's

INT. THE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her
room.

Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside.
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and
opposite number.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;



                    ELLE
          I might never of liked you. Point
          in fact I despise you. But that
          doesn't suggest I don't respect
          you. You were a master of a
          profession that's most difficult to
          master.
          Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
          kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
          you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.



                    ELLE
          Hello, Bill.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          Comatose.
              (pause)
          I'm standing over her right now.
              (pause)
          What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.



                    ELLE
          Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you
          think I came all the way down to
          Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm
          no less - just to tuck sleeping
          beauty in bed - you got another
          fuckin thing comin -
              (pause, then real loud)
          You don't owe her Shit!!
              (then again, but quieter)
          You don't owe her shit.
              (pause)
          Man, fuck that bitch!
              (pause)
          Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
          you never leave a job half done.
          A great teacher taught me that
          once, he looked a whole lot like

          you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



                    ELLE
          I guess.
              (pause)
          No, I don't need to guess, I know.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



                    ELLE
          Thought that was pretty funny
          didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
          don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.

          Ya know now I get a better look at
          you, you're not so damn pretty.
          Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
          for you but...ya know, now I get a
          closer look at you you're kinda
          weird looking. You got this big
          nose that doesn't fit with the rest
          of your face, your eyes are two
          different sizes. And look at your
          skin...My complexion is way better
          than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



                    ELLE
          Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.



                    ELLE
          If you ever take your ass out of
          this Goddamn bed for as long as you
          fuckin live, I will beat you into
          the ground, bitch!



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.



                    DOCTOR
              (yelling)
          Nurse come here quick, we're losing
          this man!

Elle doesn't even look back.



                    ELLE
          Tough titty, I quit.

She walks out of the SHOT.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

INT. THE COMATOSE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the
comatose Bride, who lies motionless in her bed.

WE HEAR the sound of a BUZZING MOSQUITO, doing loop de loops
and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

MACRO CU
of mosquito on The Bride's forearm, its stinger dug in her
flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host.

CU MOSQUITO'S FACE
drinking her blood.

MACROSHOT OF MOSQUITO ON FOREARM
drinking blood...when The Bride's hand comes into FRAME and
SQUASHES the bug flat. Her fingers FLICK the dead bug away.

CU The Bride
her wide-open eyes, that have stared in a constant gaze for
the last five years,
finally...slowly...softly...shut.

BEAT

They SUDDENLY POP OPEN.

The BRIDE SITS BOLD UPRIGHT IN BED.
She has no idea where the fuck she is. WE DO A SHAW BROTHERS
STYLE QUICK ZOOM INTO A CU OF HER FACE.

QUICK CUT TO A FLASHBACK SPAGHETTI-WESTERN STYLE
back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face.

THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



                      THE BRIDE
          My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;



                      THE BRIDE

              (to herself)
          Five years.

She counts again.



                    THE BRIDE
              (a statement)
          Five years.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING
TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT
BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS
walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks
softly slapping against the smooth surface of the
institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's
shoes.

                   SCREEN GOES TO SPLIT SCREEN

          LEFT SIDE                       RIGHT SIDE
The BRIDE listening to them            Orderly's Reeboks walking
getting closer. WE HEAR the            down the hospital
STEP...STEP...STEP...in time           corridor.
with Orderly's sneakers.

                                       CAMERA MOVES UP TO
                                       Orderly's face, leading
                                       two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;


       BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY
      (in time)                              (in time)
   She's right in here.                She's right in here.


                      SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
                   STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Now is that the cutest little
          blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
          that the cutest little blonde
          pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.



                    WARREN
          I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



                    THE ORDERLY
          Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
          know damn well this is the best
          pussy you ever saw you had touchin
          rights to. The price is seventy
          five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
          gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



                    THE ORDERLY
          Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
          no punchin 'er.
          Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
          'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
          jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
          under no circumstances.    And by the

          way, this little cunt's a spitter -
          it's a motor reflex thing but spit
          or no, no punchin. Now are we
          absolutely positively clear about
          rule number one?



                    TWO TRUCKERS
          Yeah.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Rule number two;
          No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
          fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
          But after that, it's allll goooood.
          Her plummin down there don't work
          no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
          all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
          try not to make a mess, and I'll be
          back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



                     THE ORDERLY
          Oh by the way, not all the time,
          but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
          get drier than a bucket of sand.
          If she dry, lube up with this and
          you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
          gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.



                    GERALD
          Hey Warren, she just blinked.



                    WARREN
          He said she can't blink.



                    GERALD
          I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

          she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



                    WARREN
          Just wait, when I get through with
          this little dumbbell, she gonna
          stand up and recite the Gettysburg
          Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



                    WARREN
          Hey, Gerald.



                    GERALD
          Yeah?



                    WARREN
          This shit ain't no peep show. Go
          out in the hall and I'll let ya
          know when it's your turn.



                    GERALD
          Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?



                    WARREN
          I can't get no errection wit you
          lookin at me, so go on.



                    GERALD
          Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

                    GERALD
          He man, keep it down in there, I
          can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



                       ORDERLY
          Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where's Bill?



                       THE ORDERLY
                 (hurt and confused)
          Who?

                                 SLAM!

He screams.

                    THE BRIDE
          Bill! Where is Bill!



                    THE ORDERLY
          I dunno no Bill.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw him here myself.....
              SLAM!
          ....Now do you tell me where he is,
          or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

                           SLAM!



                    THE ORDERLY
          Please please stop, don't hit me
          again!



                    THE BRIDE
          Where is Bill?

                           SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where did you get this from?



                    THE ORDERLY
          That's mine.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
          this room ten minutes ago.

                           SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



                       BUCK
             Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
             pie they all said you wuz. Well
             Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
             name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



                       THE BRIDE
             Your name's Buck, right? And you
             came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.



INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.



                    THE BRIDE
              (monotone)
          Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.



                    THE BRIDE
          Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

                          THE BRIDE
                Wiggle your big toe.
                    (VOICE OVER)
                As I lay in the back of Buck's
                pickup truck, trying to will my
                limbs out of entropy, I could see
                the faces of the cunts who did this
                to me, and the dick responsible.
                Members all of Bill's brainchild;
                "The Deadly Viper Assassination
                Squad."

WE MOVE INTO A HEAD and SHOULDERS CU OF The BRIDE'S BLACK
SILHOUETTE.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Now after five years of beauty
          sleep I knew absolutely nothing
          about my enemies' strengths
          weakness or whereabouts. But as
          fated by God vengeance would have
          it, I who knew nothing - knew one
          thing. As sure as God made little
          green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
              (continued)
          ....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
          on my Death List, was still
          alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
          Ishii, made her first acquaintance
          with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
             half-Japanese American Army brat
             witnessed the murder of her Master
             Sergeant father. And the rape, then
             murder of her mother at the hands
             of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
             boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
             revenge...luckily for her, Boss
             Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her
eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE.



                       THE BRIDE
             By twenty, she was one of the tip
             top of female assassins in the
             world.

She fires.



INT. CAR - DAY

A Central American General riding backseat    of his government
vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-   piece bathing suits
sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their
front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss
Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly
viewed.)



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty-three she joined Bill's
          Deadly Vipers...

The 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII
BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers...



                     THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty five she did her part in
          the killing of eight innocent
          people, including my unborn
          daughter, in a small wedding chapel
          in El Paso Texas. But on that day,
          five years ago, she made one big
          mistake...

POSED FIGURE of the BRIDE in all her pre-beating bridal gown
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          ...she Should of killed nine.
          However, before statisfaction would
          be mine, first things first...

FADE UP ON



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Pavement of the parking lot. We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN
OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME,
stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the
dash. She puts them on.



EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY

The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El
Paso buying supplies.

WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store.

Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S.

Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS.

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for
the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs
back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking
inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll
CROSSCUT....

....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel
called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,
getting the key, and paying him out of the "BIG EL PASO
PIMPIN" wallet....

...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room...

Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store...

...conditioner...

...a bar of soap...

...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet...

...steam rises off the hot bathwater...

...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath,
salts, apricot this - kiwi that, we see her pour all the
items in the bathwater...

...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater...

...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater...

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect
MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart
has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out
of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.



EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

and HOLSTERS.

She flips it open, and inside broken down into four separate
pieces is a HIGH-POWERED, SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE.

1 MANILA ENVELOPE.
She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.
There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A
fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,

1 SMALL KEY attached to a "DEALY VIPERS" KEY CHAIN.

She rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag, and drives off.
The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...

                           "The Undisputed Truth."

AS The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...WE see The BRIDE leaving the
bank, all the weapons she needs, all the money she needs,
taking the first step on her bloody trail...

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

SUBTITLE APPEARS:


                           "The City of
                         OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          English?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Almost -- American.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
          Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
          you speak Japanese?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Nooo, just a few words I learned
          since yesterday. - May I sit at the
          bar?



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Sure sure sure - sit. What other
          words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          -- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Oh...let's see..."Arigato."



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          "Arigato"...Very good.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          ..."Ah-So"...



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          "Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
          meansß



                     THE BRIDE
          "I See."



                    SUSHI CHEF
          I see - Very good.



                    THE BRIDE
          I already said "Domo", right?



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          ..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Most impressive...you say Japanese
          words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

                    THE BRIDE
          Now you're making fun of me.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          No no no - serious business.
          Pronunciation - very good. You say
          "Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You should learn Japanese - very
          easy.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          No kidding, I heard it's kinda
          hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I always heard it was difficult.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
          you have Japanese tongue.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Maybe I was Japanese in another
          life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Most definitely, most definitely
             Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             How did you know tuna's my
             favorite?



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             What!



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Tuna's my favorite.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
                 (to the bald man)
             I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             - Drink -



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.



                        SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ahhh sake,
                 (he holds up his thumb)
             Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          First time in Japan?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          A-huh.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What brings you to Okinawa?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I came to see a man.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Aaahh, you have friend live in
          Okinawa?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Not quite.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Not friend?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Who is he, may I ask?



                    THE BRIDE
          Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          What do you want with Hattori
          Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I need Japanese steel.



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          Why do you need Japanese steel?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I have vermin to kill.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You must have big rats you need
          Hattori Hanzo steel.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Huge.



INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...try the second one down in the
          sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I wanted to show you these....
          However someone as you, who knows
          so much must surely know, I no
          longer make instruments of death. I
          keep these here for their ascetic
          and sentimental value.
              (he takes both sword and
               sheath from her...)
          Yet proud tho I am of my life's
          work...
              (...he closes them
               together)
          I am retired.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Then give me one of these.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          These are not for sale.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
          me.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          And why should I be obliged to
          assist you in the extermination of
          your vermin?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Because my vermin, is a former
          student of yours. And considering
          the student, I'd say you had a
          rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...it will take me a week to make
          the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...I suggest you spend it
          practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE APPEARS:


                        "One week later"

Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and
read the subtitles;



                    HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
          I'm done doing what I swore an oath
          to God 28 years ago to never do
          again. I've created, "something
          that kills people." And in that
          purpose I was a success.

                                                FADE UP ON



CU HATTORI HANZO



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I've done this, because
          philosophically I'm sympathetic to
          your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD

TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...



                      HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
            I can tell you with no ego, this is
            my finest sword. If on your
            journey, you should encounter God,
            God will be cut.

CU HANZO.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            Revenge is never a straight line.
            It's a forest. And like a forest
            it's easy to lose your way...to get
            lost...
            to forget where you came in. To
            serve as a compass, a combat
            philosophy must be adopted that can
            be found in the secret doctrine of
            the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
            haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            "When engaged in combat, the
            vanquishing of thine enemy can be
            the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...This is the first and cardinal
            rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...Suppress all human emotion and
            compassion...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)

          ...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
          even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
          himself...

The Bride repeats this...



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          This truth lies at the heart of the
          art of combat. Once it is
          mastered... Thou shall fear no
          one... Though the devil himself may
          bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;



                       THE BRIDE
          Domo.

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,
her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and
removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

                                              FADE TO BLACK.

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN    ISHII.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When fortune smiles on something as
          violent and ugly as revenge, at the
          time it seems proof like no other,
          that not only does God exist,
          you're doing his will. At a time
          when I knew the last about my
          enemies, the first name on my death
          list, was the easiest to find. But

          of course,    when one manages the
          difficult    task of becoming queen of
          the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't
          keep it a    secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At the age of twenty, Bill backed
          his Nippon progeny financially and
          philosophically in her
          Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
          struggle with the other Yakuza
          clans, over who would rule vice in
          the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When it was all over, it was the
          geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
          proved the victor.



INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And just in case you're wondering
          how could a half breed Japanese
          Chinese American become the boss of
          all criminal activity in Tokyo,
          Japan,... I'll tell you. The
          subject of O-Ren's blood and
          nationality came up before the
          council only once. The night O-Ren
          assumed power over the crime
          council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The man who seems bound and
          determined to break the mood is
          Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
          thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.



                    CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)
          Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
          outburst? This is a time for
          celebration.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          And what exactly should I be
          celebrating? The perversion of our
          illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
          has something on his mind. Allow
          him to express it.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          My father...
              (looking at a clan head)
          ...along with yours and...
              (looking at another)
          ...along With yours, started this
          council. And while you drink like
          fish and laugh like donkeys, they
          weep in the afterlife over the
          perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

           Silence!
               (then composed)
           Of what perversion do you speak,
           Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



                     BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
           I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
           perversion done to this council,
           which I love more than my own
           children,...by making a half
           Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Drop them on the ground.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get behind me.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get on your knees.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



                     O-REN
           I'm going to say this in English so
           you know how serious I am. As your
           leader, I encourage you to -- from
           time to time and always in a
           respectful manner, and with the
           complete knowledge that my decision
           is final -- to question my logic.
           If you're unconvinced a particular
           plan of action I've decided is the
           wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
           convince you. And I will promise
           you, right here and now, no subject
           will be taboo...except the subject
           that was just under discussion.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
               (to a bodyguard)
           Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

          The price you pay for bringing up
          either my Chinese or my American
          heritage as a negative is, I
          collect your fuckin head.
              (now completely American)
          Just like this fucker here. Now if
          any of you sonsabitches got
          anything else to say, now's the
          fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          I didn't think so.
              (pause)
          Meeting adjourned.



EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The mop tops in black suits and
          Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
          "The Crazy 88." The two young girls
          in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
          personal bodyguards, the Yubari
          sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
          Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
          who's dressed like she's a villain
          on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
          and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
          finally, the American in the black
          suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
          head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

                                                 END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
               (to Bride)
           Can I help you?



                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
           Yes, I am looking for the attorney
           of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
           that be you?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
           I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
           can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
          O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
          unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

          You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


                          The Bride
                             vs.
                         The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
          we're going to have to close the
          place. There's some private
          business that we must attend to
          now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



                    O-REN
          Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



                    MIKI (JAPANESE)
          You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.



                     O   -REN (ENGLISH)
              (to the     Bride)
          You didn't     think it was going to be
          that easy,     did you?

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
              (to O-Ren)
          You know, for a second there, yeah
          I did.

O-Ren smiles...



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



                    O-REN/THE BRIDE
          ...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Those    of you lucky enough to still
          have    your lives. Take them with
          you.    But leave the limbs you've
          lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Any more subordinates for me to
          kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;



                    MR. BARREL
          One last one.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're Mr. Barrel, right?



                    MR. BARREL
          And you're Black Mamba.



                    THE BRIDE
          Our reputations precede us.



                    MR. BARREL
          Apparently.

                    THE BRIDE
          Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
          wear your Kato mask? Are you and
          iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



                    MR. BARREL
          I don't like that rubber band. It
          fucks up my hair.



                    THE BRIDE
          You shouldn't work for her.



                      MR. BARREL
          Too late.



                    THE BRIDE
          It's not too late to quit.



                    MR. BARREL
          Do you have choices?



                      THE BRIDE
          No.



                    MR. BARREL
          I know exactly how you feel.



                    THE BRIDE
          This has nothing to do with You and
          I, and everything to do with me
          taking satisfaction from that bitch
          behind you. And there's absolutely
          positively no way I'M going to
          leave here without taking that
          satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
          have to stand aside. And that means
          you must quit, right now.

                     MR. BARREL
          I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes you can.



                    MR. BARREL
          No I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Don't say "Can't", there are no
          "Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          What are you waiting for? Are you
          on a date? Attack her you fool!



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh my God...
              (pause)
          ...She just called you a fool. She
          just called you a fool in front of
          me. Not only am I your opponent.
          I'm a female fellow countryman.
          And you're going to risk your life -
          to say nothing of harming me - for
          a woman who refers to you as a
          fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



                      MR. BARREL
            The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



                      MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
            I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



                      MR. BARREL
            About that one you owe me.



                      THE BRIDE
            Yes?



                      MR. BARREL
            I'm gonna collect someday, you
            know?



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

                    MR. BARREL
          Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Very funny.
              (pause)
          Your instrument is quite
          impressive.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Where was it made?



                      THE BRIDE
          Okinawa.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Whom in Okinawa made you this
          steel?



                    THE BRIDE
          This is Hattori Hanzo steel.



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Swords however never get tired. I
          hope you've saved your energy. If
          you haven't, you might not last
          five minutes.
              (pause)

          Have you seen the garden in this
          establishment?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          No.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Oh, you really should. It's quite
          beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          As last looks go, you could do
          worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
          with samurai swords. Bill might of
          humored you, but you will find
          neither humor nor mercy at my
          blade. Now unless you intend to
          commit sepeku among the koi, stand
          up and fight. You may not be able
          to fight like a samurai, but you
          can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me. With everything you
          have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          I apologize for ridiculing you
          earlier.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Accepted.

They continue breathing...



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Ready?



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           That really was a Hattori Hanzo
           sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           Did he make it for you?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
           Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           ...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

                                                  CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE
behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an
insert from "GRAND PRIX."

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
car speeding...then stopping.

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I've kept you alive for one reason.
          Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
          I take it you're familiar with
          Bill?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
          worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
          that's how it is you came to work
          for O-Ren. Am I correct?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I thought so. Give me the arm you
          have left.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Why?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I want information. Now gimme your
          arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          The cocktail racing    through your
          bloodstream at this    moment is
          Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The
          Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, first things first. Where was
          the other Yubari sister? Yuki?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki's sick. She went home early.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Do tell? What's wrong with her?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She has a cold.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Awwww poor baby. What do you think
          she'll do when she finds out what
          happened?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)

          She'll wail with grief.

                                               SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.



                    BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
          me, yes or no?

                       BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How bout now, big boy, do you still
          wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          When she stops shedding tears,
          she'll start shedding blood.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Best guess, what will she do?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          I don't hafta guess, she'll come
          after you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Will she ever give up?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She won't have to. When she finds

          you, I don't know who will win. But
          what I do know is, she will find
          you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Is she more skilled than I?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Skilled won't be the word.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
          would be the word?



                    SOFIE
          Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, now I want all the
          information on the Deadly
          Vipers,... What they've been doing
          and where I can find them.



EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

                                                 CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
          sorry.

                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- no more of that. I invented that
          truth serum. Once it entered your
          bloodstream, you no longer had a
          choice.



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          But, still --



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- But still -- nothing, except my
          aching heart over what she's done
          to my beautiful and brilliant
          Sofie.
              (pause)
          If you had to guess why she left
          you alive, what would be your
          guess?



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Guessing won't be necessary. She
          informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I'm allowing you to keep your
          wicked life for one reason and one
          reason only. So you can tell him,
          in person, everything that happened
          here tonight. I want him to witness
          the extent of my mercy..., by
          witnessing your deformed body. I
          want you to tell him, all the
          information you just told me. I
          want him to know what I know. I
          want him to know I want him to
          know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          And I want them all to know,
          they'll all soon be as dead as O
          REN.

                                              WE CUT TO A

CU of SOFIE
WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)
          If O-Ren was number one, unless
          she's being tricky, Vernita Green
          will be number two.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Where is Vernita Green?



                    BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)
          Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.
          But the woman you want will hold up
          in a low budget motel, fifteen of
          twenty minutes away from stepping
          on board a plane departing LAX. If
          I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          California, here I come.

                                                   CUT TO:

We see Yuki running around all over LA, Hollywood and

                           FULL SCREEN

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from
the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a
distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa.
              (pause)
          Yuki?



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Bingo!

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Can I help you?



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You can kill yourself.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Taking a trip?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I was.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You still are. One way.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I know you feel you must avenge
          your sister. But I beg you...walk
          away.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You call that begging? You can beg
          better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Can I see your    face? I've heard
          your beauty is    exquisite. I would
          like to see for    myself.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
          is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



                    THE BRIDE
          Domo.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Your face is so    pretty, I just want
          to put both of    my palms against
          your cheeks and    give you little
          tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How do I look?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Very pretty.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You're just saying that 'cause I
          told you how pretty you are.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, you're gorgeous.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Really? Is that how you'd describe
          me to somebody if I wasn't here?
          Yuki's gorgeous?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          You bet.

Yuki giggles.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't make me kill you.



                     YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in your house and stay down on
          the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Time for the rabbit to come out of
          her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You fucking bitch! You shot me in
          my breast! They're not fully
          developed yet, you fucking asshole!
          Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
          going to be an army    of police here.
          So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
          the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
          So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.



                       THE BRIDE
             Goddamn, what a wildcat.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



                       NURSE OWENS
             Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



                       THE BRIDE
             Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --



                       NURSE OWENS
             Who is this.



                       THE BRIDE
             You don't know me, but --



                       NURSE OWENS
             -- And I don't want to neither. Now

I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --



          THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --



          NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.



             THE BRIDE
I'm dying.



          NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.



          THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.



             NURSE OWENS
--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



          THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.



          NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!



          THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, where you at?



                    THE BRIDE
          I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
          kids treehouse. It's a street
          called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
          Avenue. There's a bunch of police
          cars and firetrucks, about two
          blocks away.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?



                    THE BRIDE
          If you can't walk, you better
          crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You got you some money dontcha, or
          am I doin this out of the goodness
          of my heart?



                    THE BRIDE
          You come and get me, today's pay
          day.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You ain't too far away. You gonna
          bleed to death I get there in a
          half a hour?



                      THE BRIDE
          Probably.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
          minutes.

                    THE BRIDE
          Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
          C.P.T.?



                    NURSE OWENS
          Just you better be there    when I get
          there, and you better be    shot five
          times, and your bony ass    better be
          on your last motherfuckin    legs.



                    THE BRIDE
          How do you know I have a bony ass?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



                    THE BRIDE
          Glad you made it.



                    NURSE OWENS
          There's cops all over here, I had
          to be cool. They tend to notice
          things like Negroes sneaking around
          people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



                    THE BRIDE
          What's that?



                    NURSE OWENS
          This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
          got no anesthetic.

              (refers to the bottle)
          So git busy.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



                    THE BRIDE
          That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;



                    NURSE OWENS
          Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
          future, you should avoid them if
          you can.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
          have a future?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You'll live to kill again.



                      THE BRIDE
          Splendid.

She passes out.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.

             Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



                       L.F.
             Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



                       L.F.
                 (to the players)
             We now return to the game already
             in progress. The point is nine
             gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



                       ALBURT
             I'll take that.



                       BILL
             You'll have to.

The two men stare...



                       L.F.
             Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
             intend to start any shit with that
             sword?



                       BILL
             I give you my word of honor, I will
             start nothing.

                    L.F.
          Good enough for me.
              (back to game)



                    ALBURT
          Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
          dollar membership fee.



                    BILL
          That's rather pricey.



                    ALBURT
          You wanna play for free, go to
          Vegas. You start now you'll be
          there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



                    BILL
          I think I'll stay here. I'm
          thirsty.



                      ALBURT
          That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



                      BILL
          Beer.



                    BARTENDER
          Twenty dollars.



                    BILL
          Twenty dollars for a beer?



                    BARTENDER
          High cost of living shooter. You
          don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

          get a prime rib dinner there for
          3.95.



                    BILL
          What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
              (throws a 20 on the bar)
          Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



                    BILL
              (pointing to the can)
          I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



                    BILL
          Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



                    L.F.
          Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
          in school wants    to play right away.
              (to Bill)
          How bout it new    kid, you wanna
          handle my bones,    or do you just
          like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



                    BILL
          I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



                    L.F.
          Boys take a look at this man, he's
          what Webster's calls, a gambler.
          The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

                    L.F.
          I hope you're not implying
          anything, friend?



                    BILL
              (as he inspects dice)
          I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



                    ALBURT
          That did it fuckhead, you're out
          the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



                    BILL
          You looked me over when I stood in
          your doorway. I'm looking you over
          as I step up to your table. If I
          don't know, I don't throw.



                    L.F.
          Are you satisfied?



                    BILL
          More or less.



                    L.F.
          I think we're getting into a
          antagonistic relationship.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
          trying to take my money, and I was
          trying to take yours.

                    L.F.
          It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



                     BILL
          If you're game, take my bet
          sportsman.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



                    L.F.
          The point is five, gentlemen, five
          is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                    L.F.
          Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



                    BILL
          Play a game of luck long enough
          you're bound to meet some lucky
          people.



                    L.F.
          You know we've never been properly
          introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



                    BILL
          And I'm not interested.



                    L.F.
          No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
          boy, I'm only trying to be
          friendly.



                    BILL
          I didn't come here to make friends.
          I came here to shoot a little crap.
          But then your boy over there hits
          me up for a two hundred dollar
          privilege to play fee --



                    L.F.
          -- That's a membership fee, good
          for --



                    BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



          L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



             BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



          L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



          BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



          L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



             BILL

          Oooohhh, that's....



                    L.F.
          The house's perogative and you know
          it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



                    L.F.
          Maybe you would like to change your
          bet?



                    BILL
          Yes I would.....Shoot it
          all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



                     L.F.
          What?



                    BILL
          Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
          I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



                    ALBURT
          You can't do that.



                    BILL
          Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
          perogative, and she knows it.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



                    BILL
          Can I use your phone?



                    L.F.
          Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



                    L.F.
          Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
          out! No more tonight, go home....



                    BILL
              (into phone)
          Vernita's dead? When?
              (pause)
          What about her family?
              (pause)
          Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
          completely apeshit. No idea where
          she is?
              (pause)
          Okay that did it, we're going to
          Texas and talk sense into Budd
          before (BLEEP) makes him number
          three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



                    BILL
          We're going to have a talk about
          this later.
              (pause)

          Well, I'm not exactly among friends
          at the moment.
              (pause...he laughs)
          I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



                    BILL
          Got a nose problem?



                    L.F.
          I said you could use my phone. I
          didn't say I wouldn't listen.



                    BILL
          This is true.



                    L.F.
          You didn't burn me down you know?



                     BILL
          Course not. First rule of any
          house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
          comes in and wipes the place out
          insurance.



                     L.F.
          If there weren't losers it wouldn't
          be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



                    BILL
          I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
             the real game was just beginning.
             Bill was on the job, and she was
             the target. Now Bill was the
             greatest assassin of the 20th
             century. In fact the term HITMAN
             was coined for him. And he rarely
             performs actual assassinations
             anymore. However every once in
             awhile - to keep his hand in - he
             does. Only he plays a game. He
             doesn't start big trouble...he lets
             them start it. If they do, they're
             dead. If they don't, not only won't
             he perform, he'll take the hit off
             the market. It's kind of fun
             watching people gamble when they
             don't know they're gambling, isn't
             it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



                       L.F.
             Get my money back. Don't kill him.
             Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



                    BILL
          Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



                    BILL
          Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE CARD:


                        Chapter seven

                     "The lonely grave of
                        Paula Schultz"



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

                           "The city of
                          Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning. Brother
          Bill livin up to his familia
          obligation.



                    BILL
          How ya doin' Budd?



                    BUDD
          Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
          mad rush of wild parties and
          wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



                    BUDD
          Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
          Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



                    BILL
          It's Elle. Want to say hello?



                    BUDD
          Never said "bye," can't seem to
          think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



                    BUDD
          What'd ya wanna talk about?



                    BILL
          Are you not going to invite me in?



                    BUDD
          No.



                    BILL
          May I ask why not?



                    BUDD
          It stinks in there, that's why. Now
          what's so important it requires a
          reunion?

                                                TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



                    BUDD
          You tryin to tell me she cut her
          way through eighty-eight bodyguards
          'fore she got to O-Ren?



                    BILL
          No. There wasn't really eighty
          eight of them, they just called
          themselves The Crazy 88.



                    BUDD
          Why.



                    BILL

          I dunno, I guess they thought it
          sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
          26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
          attacked. They all fell under her
          Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



                    BUDD
          She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



                    BILL
          She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



                    BUDD
          He made her one? Didn't he swear a
          blood oath never to make another
          sword?



                    BILL
          It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



                    BUDD
          Them Japs know how to carry a
          grudge don't they? Or is it just
          you tend to bring that out in
          people?



                    BILL
              (pause)
          I know this is a ridiculous
          question before I ask, but you by
          any chance haven't kept up with
          your swordplay?



                    BUDD
          Hell, I pawned that years ago.



                    BILL
          You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

                    BUDD
          Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



                    BILL
          It was priceless.



                    BUDD
          Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
          I got me 250 Dollars for it.



                    BILL
          Since it was a gift from me, why
          didn't you offer me the chance to
          buy it back?



                    BUDD
          Because that would've required me
          to acknowledge your existence.
          Drunken bum though I may be, I
          don't need booze that bad. But who
          the hell gives a crap anyway. That
          bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
          points for killin a white trash
          piece of shit like me with a
          samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
          titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
          fight me, all she gotta do is come
          down to the Club, start some shit,
          and we'll be in a a fight.



                    BILL
          -- Budd, you need to listen to me.
          I know we haven't spoken for quite
          some time, and the last time we
          spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
          you need to get over being mad at
          me, and start becoming afraid of
          Bea. Because she is coming, and
          she's coming to kill you. And
          unless you accept my assistance, I
          have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

                       BILL
             Can't we forget the past, and look
             at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



                       BUDD
             And what would that happy side be?



                       BILL
             She's brought "the boys" back
             together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



                       BUDD
             I appreciate the concern on your
             face, but there's a difference
             'tween "the boys", time can't
             erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
             don't Jew outta payin my
             comeuppance. That woman deserves
             her revenge. And we deserve to die.
             But then again, so does she. So I
             guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



                       TED
             You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
             school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



                       STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd.



                    BUDD
          Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



                    STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
          it again. There's shitty water all
          over the floor.



                    BUDD
          I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



                       THE BRIDE
          Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



                     BUDD
           Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
           like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



                     BUDD

          You done got a double dose of rock
          salt, right in the ole tit.
          Now not havin tits as fine or as
          big as yours, I can't even imagine
          how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



                    BUDD
          ...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



                    BUDD
          Now I know when it    comes to a rock
          salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
          much like a expert    bout now. But
          truth be told, you    ain't felt all
          rock salt's got to    offer till you
          took a double dose    in your
          backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



                    BUDD
          That gentled ya down, didn't it?
          Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
          two barrels of rock salt dug deep
          in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



                      ELLE
          Bill?



                    BUDD
          Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



                      ELLE
          ....Budd?



                      BUDD
          Bingo.



                    ELLE
          And what do I owe this dubious
          pleasure?



                    BUDD
          I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
          never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



                    ELLE
          Do you mean what I think you mean?



                    BUDD
          If you think I mean I got 'er, you
          thought right.

                    ELLE
          Did you kill her?



                    BUDD
          Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
          it easy enough. She's so gentle
          right now, I could preform her coup
          de grace with a rock.



                    ELLE
          What are you waiting for, run outta
          liquid courage.



                    BUDD
          No. It's just...I ain't killed
          nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
          just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
          Christ, kinda made me a promise I
          wasn't gonna. Be that however it
          is. Back when I did kill people...I
          got paid for it. Just don't seem
          right...turn amateur this time of
          life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



                    BUDD (O.S.)
          Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
          hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



                    BUDD
          A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
          sword. And I'm here to tell ya
          Elle, that's what I call sharp.



                      ELLE
          How much?



                    BUDD
          Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
          priceless and all.

          ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



          BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



          ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



          BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



          ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



          BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



          ELLE
What's the terms?



          BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



          ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          You kill her tonight.
              (pause)
          And one more thing.



                    BUDD
          You said one condition.



                     ELLE
          It's a caveat to the same
          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          She must suffer to her last breath.



                    BUDD
          That Elle darlin, I can pretty
          damwell guarantee.



                    ELLE
          Then I'll see you in the morning
          millionaire.

                                                 CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



                    BUDD
          Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          Look at those eyes. This bitch is
          furious. You grab her feet, I'll
          get her head.
              (ENGLISH)
          Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          In America white women call this
          the silent treatment.
              (laughing)
          And we let 'em think, we don't like
          it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



                    BUDD
          Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
          this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



                    BUDD
          Looky here bitch, this is a can of
          mace. Now you're goin underground
          tonight, and that's all there is to
          it. But, when I bury ya, I was
          gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

                       BUDD
          But if    you're gonna act like    a
          horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
          Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
          you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
          alive.    So what's it gonna be
          sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



                    BUDD
          You may be stupid, but at least you
          ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



                        THE BRIDE
             Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

                     THE BRIDE
          Well, now that you've had a nice,
          good cry, let's figure out how to
          get out of here? You're breathing
          like you just been fuckin. Calm
          down...close your mouth, and start
          breathing short breaths, through
          your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's a lot better. But you're
          still too agitated. Can you hear
          your heart? It's like I'm buried
          alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
          that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
          you can. The darkness will have a
          calming effect. Now turn off that
          fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



                    BUDD
              (into phone)
          Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



                       ELLE
             Didja do it?



                       BUDD
             Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
             speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

                        "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


                "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



                       BILL (V.O.)
             Once upon a time in China, some
             believe around the year, one-double
             knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

                     BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
          ...head priest of The White Lotus
          Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
          road, contemplating whatever a man
          with Pai Mei's infinite power would
          contemplate -- Which is another way
          of saying, who knows. When, a
          Shaolin monk appeared on the road
          traveling in the opposite
          direction. As the monk and the
          priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
          in a practically unfathomable
          display of generosity, gave the
          monk the slightest of nods. The
          nod, was not returned. Was it the
          intention of the Shaolin monk to
          insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
          fail to see the generous social
          gesture?
          The motives of the monk, remain,
          unknown. What is known, were the
          consequences. The next morning Pai
          Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
          and demanded that the temple's head
          Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
          repay the insult. The Abbot, at
          first, tried to console Pai Mei,
          only to find, Pai Mei was
          inconsolable. So began, the
          massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
          all sixty of the monks inside, at
          the fists of the White Lotus. And
          so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
          Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
          Technique.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
          exploding heart technique?



                    BILL (V.O.)
          Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
          all of the martial arts. He hits
          you with his fingertips, at ten
          different pressure points on your
          body. And then, he lets you walk
          away. But once you've taken five
          steps, your heart explodes inside
          your body, and you fall to the
          floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then

fall to the floor dead.



EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



                    THE BRIDE
          Did he teach you that?



                    BILL
          No. He teaches no one the ten-point
          palm - exploding heart technique.
          But he is Nietzsche's psalm
          personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
          kill you, he will make you
          stronger. Now one of the things I
          always liked about you, Kiddo, is
          you appear wise beyond your years.
          Then allow me to impart, a word to
          the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
          Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
          him - even for an instant - a
          defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
          And if you throw any American sass
          his way, he will snap your back and
          your neck like they were twigs, and
          that will be the story of you.



EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



                    BILL
          He'll accept you as his student.

                    THE BRIDE
          Caught him in a good mood, aye?



                    BILL
          More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



                    BILL
          Just seeing those steps again makes
          me ache. You're gonna have plenty
          of fun carrying buckets of water up
          and down that fucker.



                    THE BRIDE
          Why did he accept me?



                    BILL
          Because he's a very very very old
          man. And like all rotten bastards,
          when they get old, they become
          lonely. Not that that has any
          effect on their disposition. But
          they do learn the value of company.



                    THE BRIDE
          When will I see you again?



                    BILL
          That's the title of my favorite
          soul song of the Seventies.



                    THE BRIDE
          What?



                    BILL
          Nothing. When he tells me you're
          done.

                    THE BRIDE
          When do you think that might be?



                    BILL
          That my dearest, all depends on
          you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
          sarcasm.
          Least not for the first year.
          You're going to have to let him
          warm up for you. He hates
          Caucasians, despises Americans, and
          has nothing but contempt for women,
          so in your case, that may take a
          little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



                    THE BRIDE
              (yelling)
          Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          If it is Christ you seek, turn back
          now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



                     THE BRIDE *
          Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
          student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
          understand a single word you say.
          It causes my ears discomfort. You
          are not to speak unless spoken to.
          Do you understand Mandarin any
          better than you speak it?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I speak Japanese very well --



                    PAI    MEI'S VOICE *
          I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,
          or Mongolian,    for that matter. I
          asked if you    understand Mandarin?



                    THE BRIDE *

          A little, I am still learning.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          You are here to learn the mysteries
          of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
          can't understand me, I will
          communicate with you like I would a
          dog. When I yell, when I point,
          When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.



                    PAI MEI *
          Bill is your master, is he not?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes, he is.



                    PAI MEI *
          Your master tells me you're not
          entirely unschooled. What training
          do you possess?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I am proficient in a combination of
          Tiger and Crane style. And I am
          more than proficient in the
          exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



                    PAI MEI *
              (he makes a SNORTING
               SOUND)
          The exquisite art of the samurai
          sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
          called exquisite art, is only fit
          for Japanese fat heads. You really
          are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

                     PAI MEI *
           Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



                     THE BRIDE *
           I'm sorry master --



                     PAI MEI *
           -- Silence! I do not wish to hear
           your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



                     PAI MEI *
           Your anger amuses me. Do you
           believe you are my match?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Are you aware I kill at will?



                       THE BRIDE *
           Yes.



                     PAI MEI *
           Is it your wish to die?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Then you must be stupid. Rise
           stupid, and let me get a better

             look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



                       PAI MEI *
             You breathe hard. The one hundred
             steps robbed you of your wind. So
             your stupidity is matched only by
             your weakness. Is there anything
             you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
             Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
             Japs. I would of thought an
             American would be immune to their
             pompous posturing. Apparently I was
             wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



                       PAI MEI *
             Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



                       PAI    MEI *
             Let's see how    good you really are.
             Try and land    a blow. If you land a
             single blow,    I'll bow down and call
             you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

                    PAI MEI *
          Come now woman, can't you even hit
          an old man?

She tries more...



                    PAI MEI *
          Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



                    PAI MEI *
          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
          cripples who posed more of a
          challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



                    PAI MEI *
          From here you can get an excellent
          view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



                    PAI MEI *
          Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



                    PAI MEI *
          That blade's sharp. Careful not to
          cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



                    PAI MEI *
          If you can't fight any better than
          that, what use do you have for a
          leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



                    PAI MEI *
          Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

                    PAI MEI *
          Your swordsmanship is amateur at
          best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



                    PAI MEI *
          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
          and you can't even make me break a
          sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



                    PAI MEI *
          Let's see your Tiger and Crane
          style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



                    PAI MEI *
          ...pathetic.....terrible...you
          idiot, you should've landed that
          blow...you call that crane?...
          Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



                    PAI MEI *
          I asked you to show me what you
          know, and you did. Not a goddamn
          thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



                    PAI MEI *
          Like all yankee women, the only
          thing you know how to do is order

          in restaurants and spend a man's
          money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



                    PAI MEI *
          Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
          a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;



                     THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          I could chop off your arm at will.
          I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;



                    THE BRIDE
          No please don't!



                    PAI MEI *
          If you wish to speak romantic
          languages, you've come to the wrong
          place.



                    THE BRIDE *
          Please don't cut my arm off!



                    PAI MEI *
          It's my arm now. I can do with it
          what I please. If you can stop me,
          I suggest you try.



                     THE BRIDE *
          I can't!

                    PAI MEI *
          Because you're helpless?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          Have you ever felt this before?



                    THE BRIDE *
          No!



                    PAI MEI *
          Compared to me you're as helpless
          as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
          you?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!!!



                    PAI MEI *
          THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.



                    PAI MEI *
          Is it your wish to learn how to
          make others as helpless as you
          were?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.



                    PAI MEI *
          Can you cook?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.

                    PAI MEI *
          I'll be the judge of    that.
              (pause)
          Draw me a bath...your    training will
          begin tomorrow. That    arm is still
          mine. You may lose it    yet.

                                                   TIME CUT



EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



                    PAI MEI *
          Since your arm now belongs to me, I
          want it strong. Can you do that?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can, but not that close.



                    PAI MEI *
          Then you can't do it.



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can put my hand through that at
          six inches.



                    PAI MEI *
          And you could shoot a man from a
          rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
          if you so desired, but this is not
          what I asked. What if your enemy is
          three inches in front of you, what
          do you do then? Curl into a ball?
          Or do you put your fist through
          him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

                         PAI MEI *
            Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.



                      PAI MEI *
            If you want to eat like a dog, I
            will make you live and sleep like a
            dog. Outside. If you want to live
            and sleep like a human being, pick
            up those sticks.

She does.



THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.



                      PAI MEI *
            It's the wood that       should fear your
            hand, not the other       way around. No
            wonder you can't do       it, you
            acquiesce to defeat       before you even
            begin.

He walks off in a huff.



EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

                    PAI MEI *
          In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.



                    PAI MEI *
          In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



                    PAI MEI *
          You are to go into that pit, and
          catch that rat, with your bare
          hands. If you catch the rat, I will
          deem you the victor, and tonight
          you will dine on bird. But, if you
          can't catch the rat by sundown,
          I'll deem the victor the rat. And
          because of the disgrace to my
          student, I will be forced to kill
          it. And then I will force you, to
          consume his body. Because to be my
          student, you must develop a taste
          for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

                     THE BRIDE *
          I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
          this rat. However, I will not eat
          this filthy vermin. What I will
          do...
              (she RIPS the rat open
                like a pomegranate)
          ...is consume his victorious heart.
              (she snatches the tiny
                heart from the rodent's
                carcass. Holding it
                between her fingers.)
          But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;



                    PAI MEI *
          How does victory taste?



                       THE BRIDE *
          Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.



                       THE BRIDE
                 (to herself)
          Wow!



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.



                    PAI MEI *
          Woman, is that you who disturbs my
          meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

                      THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Yes, teacher.



                      PAI MEI *
            Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.



                      PAI MEI *
            What news do you find so worthy, as
            to disrupt my bath?



                      THE BRIDE *
            I did it teacher. I put my fist
            through the wall.

                                                  TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.



                      PAI MEI *
            Very good. Would you care to
            demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.



                      THE BRIDE *
            I think you watching is making me
            nervous.



                      PAI MEI *
            Not only that, it has you speaking
            before you were spoken to. Try
            again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;



                    PAI MEI
          Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;



                    THE BRIDE *
          Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.



                    PAI MEI *
          You still fight better than you
          speak. Finally, a woman who
          understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.



                    PAI MEI *
          Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

                                                 CUT TO:



BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;



                    THE BRIDE
          I'd like a glass of water.

                                          FADE TO BLACK.

CU ELLE DRIVER
Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving
full out on top of the desert's surface. Spanish Rock coming

out of her powerful speakers.



EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.



                    BUDD
          Want some breakfast?



INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



                    ELLE
          ...So that's called a Texas
          funeral?



                    BUDD
          Yep.



                    ELLE
          I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
          a pretty fucked up way to die.
          What's the name on the grave she's
          buried under?



                    BUDD
          Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



                    ELLE

          Can I look at the sword?



                    BUDD
          That's my money in that black case,
          isn't it?



                     ELLE
          Sure is.



                    BUDD
          Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



                    ELLE
          So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



                    BUDD
          That's a Hanzo sword alright.



                    ELLE
          Bill tells me you once had one of
          your own.

Pause.



                     BUDD
          Once.



                    ELLE
          How does this one compare to that
          one?



                    BUDD
          If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
          sword, you compare it to every

          sword ever made -- wasn't made by
          Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
          around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.



                    BUDD
          So, which "R" you filled with?



                    ELLE
          What?



                    BUDD
          They say the number one killer of
          old people is retirement. People
          got'em a job to do, they tend to
          live a little longer so they can do
          it. I've always figured warriors
          and their enemies share the same
          relationship. So now you ain't
          gonna hafta face your enemy on the
          battlefield no more, which "R" are
          you filled with, Relief or Regret?



                    ELLE
          A little bit of both.



                     BUDD
          Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
          little bit of both. But I know damn
          well you feel one more than you
          feel the other. The question was
          which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



                    ELLE
          Regret.



                    BUDD
          Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
          girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
          Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
          Bill useta think she was so damn
          smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
          she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.



                    ELLE
          Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



                    ELLE
          Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
          of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
          to introduce my friend, The Black
          Mamba.
              (gesturing towards the
               refridgerator)
          Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
          know before I picked up that little
          fella, I looked him up on the
          internet.
              (she removes her notepad
               from her pocket)

          Fascinating creature the Black
          Mamba. Listen to this,
              (reading from the notepad)
          "...In Africa, the saying goes, in
          the bush, an elephant can kill you.
          A leopard can kill you. And a Black
          Mamba can kill you. But only with
          the Mamba, and this has been true
          in Africa since the dawn of time,
          is death sure. Hence its handle;
          Death Incarnate."
              (looking up from the
               paper)
          Pretty cool, huh?
              (back to paper)
          "...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
          nature's most effective poisons,
          acting on the nervous system
          causing paralysis. The venom of a
          Black Mamba can kill a human in
          four hours, if say bitten on the
          ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
          to the face or torso can bring
          death from paralysis within twenty
          minutes.
              (up from paper to Budd)
          Now you should listen to this cause
          this concerns you.
              (reading from the paper)
          The amount of venom that can be
          delivered from a single bit can be
          gargantuan.
              (looks up from paper)
          -- You know I've always liked that
          word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
          have an opportunity to use it in a
          sentence.
              (back to paper)
          "If not treated quickly with anti
          venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
          fatal to human beings. However, the
          Black Mamba can deliver as much as
          100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
          a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.



                    ELLE
          Now in these last agonizing minutes
          of life you have left, let me
          answer the question you asked
          earlier, more thoroughly. When it
          comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
          "R's" in me. Revenge is one.
          Retribution is another. Rivalry is
          definitely one. But I got another

          "R" for that bitch you might be
          surprised to find out. Respect. But
          right at this moment, the biggest
          "R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
          maybe the greatest warrior I have
          ever met, met her end at the hands
          of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
          piece of shit like you. The woman
          deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.



                    ELLE
              (into phone)
          Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
          news.
              (pause)
          Your brother's dead.
              (pause)
          I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.



                    ELLE (CONT'D)
          She put a Black Mamba in his
          camper.
              (pause)
          I got her, sweety.
              (pause)
          She's dead.
              (pause)
          Let me put it this way. If you ever
          start feeling sentimental, go to
          Austin, Texas. When you get here,
          walk into a florist and buy a bunch
          of flowers. Then you take those
          flowers to Huntington cemetery on
          Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
          headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
          then lay them on the grave. Because
          you will be standing at the final
          resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;



                    ELLE
          Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.



                    ELLE
          Now that's what I call sharp.



EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see
the dead walk, she sees the dead behind two tons of metal
coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



                    ELLE
          Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
          alacky had got the best of you.



                    THE BRIDE
          You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



                    ELLE
              (referring to the sword)
          What's that?

                    THE BRIDE
          Guess that makes him a liar, don't
          it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.

          You wouldn't lie to me now?



                            ELLE
          Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw what you did to that little
          Mamba in there. Want to try that on
          somebody your own size?




                    ELLE
          I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



                            THE BRIDE
          Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
          we get started. Hattori Hanzo
          swords are extremely sharp. They
          can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
          Careful not to cut your own arm
          off.



                    ELLE
          I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're gonna bleed though, you're
          gonna bleed a lot.

separating. We don't know who's cut.

The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if
it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds.

We feel a count of...One Mississippi...

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its
TIP.

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
          to leave now.



                    BILL
              (finishing up)
          Yes, I got to go and meet the
          Duchess.
              (referring to the flowers)
          Do you like it?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.



                    BILL
          Why don't you put it on the dinner
          table, so we can enjoy it tonight.



                    JOSEPHINA
              (she takes it)
          Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



                    BILL
          Oh and Josephina, take the
          remaining flowers and spread them
          around the house, if you would.

                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



                    BILL
          You know I just had a great idea.
          Take the roses, and spread the
          petals on the bed I just got for
          her. That'd be a nice thing to come
          home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
          roses.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.



                    BILL
          You wouldn't mind doing that for
          me, would you Josephina?



                    JOSEPHINA
          No, not at all.

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

          Y'all figured I'd face him with my

          Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
          Different teachers teach you
          different things. But one thing I
          learned from all three, was "in
          combat, the opponent that does the
          unexpected, can usually expect to
          be the victor." Bill would never
          see this coming. Not from me. And
          least any of you judge me a
          bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
          who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.



EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.



INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.



                    BILL
          Hola.



INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Bill.



                    BILL
          Kiddo, is that really you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's me all right.



                    BILL
          I hear you were driving a truck?



                    THE BRIDE
          My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
          your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.



                    BILL
          Oh, you mean the little tow head
          next to me, who looks
          extraordinarily like you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, that one.



                    BILL
          Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.



                    THE BRIDE
          B.B.?



                    BILL
          Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes. Can she hear us?



                    BILL
          Not now, she's in dream land.



                    THE BRIDE
          How old is she?



                    BILL
          What do you mean by that?



                    THE BRIDE
          How many years has she been alive?

          BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.



          THE BRIDE
Is she five?



          BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?



          THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
    (pause)
I want to meet her.



          BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.



          THE BRIDE
What do you mean?



          BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.



          THE BRIDE
    (confused)
What have you told her about me?



          BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a

          picture of you --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- which one?



                    BILL
          The one I took of you in Paris,
          sitting on the steps with the
          baguette in your hand. Since she
          was one and a half years old, she's
          slept with that picture of you next
          to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.



                    THE BRIDE
          You know, prettier photos of me do
          exist.



                    BILL
          And she's seen them. But the one
          she wants looking after her while
          she sleeps is the one of you
          holding bread.
              (pause)
          We normally have dinner around
          seven, is that convenient?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...



                    THE BRIDE
          When do we cross swords?



                    BILL
          Well, it just so happens, my
          hacienda comes with its very own
          private beach. And my private
          beach, just so happens to look
          particularly beautiful bathed in
          moonlight. And there just so
          happens to be a full moon out
          tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

          want to sword fight, that's where I
          suggest. But if you wanna be old
          school about it - then we can wait
          till dawn, and slice each other up
          at sunrise, like a couple real life
          honest to goodness samurais. As per
          usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
          decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



                    THE BRIDE
          Do me a courtesy?



                      BILL
          Anything.



                    THE BRIDE
          Slow down as we pass...I want
          another look at her.



                    BILL
          Wear something nice tonight?



                    THE BRIDE
          I have a dress all picked out.



                    BILL
          Will I like it?



                    THE BRIDE
          You said I looked beautiful last
          time you saw me in it.



                    BILL
          I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



                    THE BRIDE
          You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



                    BILL
          Now you just wait one second there
          little missy. Unless I'm confused,
          we are trying to kill each other
          aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
          taking a shot at you in front of
          the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
          if you're gonna forget everything I
          ever taught you, and gawk like you
          ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
          take a shot, am I not?



                    THE BRIDE
          Did she wake up?



                    BILL
          Of course not. She's like you that
          way.
          I look forward to this evening. It
          was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
              (in phone; groggy)
          Hello....



INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Hattori!



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Beatrix, what's wrong?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

                                                 CUT TO:



INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          Half of Bill's strength, lies in
          his talent for the unexpected.
          If you intend to vanquish this man,
          and claim your daughter, you must
          not only expect the unexpected. You
          must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Josephina.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in here and don't come out. If
          you leave this room I'll shoot you,
          comprende?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Kiddo! If you're through shooting
          the servants, I'm in the living
          room. You remember how to get to
          the living room, don'tcha? Go down
          to the end of the hall, and make a
          left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



                     BILL
              (loudly)
          Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

                    BILL
          Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



                    B.B.
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



                    BILL
          Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
          you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



                    BILL
          You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
          are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



                    BILL
          But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
          know,...that five-year-old B.B.
          Gunn was only playing possum, due
          to the fact she was impervious to
          bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



                     B.B.

              (to Mommy)
          I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



                    BILL
              (to B.B.)
          Hey, get back down there, you're
          playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



                    BILL
          So, as the smirking killer
          approached, what she thought, was a
          bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
          the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



                       B.B.
          Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



                    BILL
          Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
          known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



                    B.B.
          Don't die Mommy, I was just
          playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



                    MOMMY
          I know baby.

They embrace each other.



                    B.B.
          I waited a long time for you to
          wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
          - I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



                    THE BRIDE
          Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Now let me look at you. My my my...
          What a pretty girl you are.



                    B.B.
          You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



                       THE BRIDE
          Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



                    BILL
          When I showed you Mommy's picture,
          tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



                       BILL

          C'mon shy girl, you know what you
          said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
          fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



                    B.B.
          I said - I said - You're the most
          beautiful woman I ever saw in the
          whole white world.



                    BILL
          That's the truth. That's what she
          said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



                    B.B.
          What's that?



                    MOMMY
          Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
          dress.



                    B.B.
          Blood?



                    MOMMY
          No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?



                    B.B.
          No.



                    BILL
          Do you not like it, or do you not
          know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



                    B.B.
          I do not know what it is.

                    MOMMY
          Well, it's a very tasty beverage
          that I used to drink, when I was a
          little girl. It comes in a lot of
          different flavors and colors, and
          it's really good. Maybe we should
          fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



                     BILL
          Speaking of fixing and drinking and
          eating, I think it's dinner time
          don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



                    BILL
              (to Mommy)
          When you were doin all that fancy
          shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
          a nice Mexican woman about forty
          five years old, did ya?



                    MOMMY
          No.



                     BILL
              (wiping imaginary sweat
               off his brow)
          Whew, then dinner should be done.
              (shouting to the other
               room)
          Josephina! You can come out now,
          we're ready for dinner.



                    JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



                    BILL
          Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;



                      B.B.
          Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.



                    BILL
          B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
          prettiest hair in the whole wide
          world?



                      B.B.
          Yes I do.



                    BILL
          In fact it's better than pretty.
          What's better than pretty?



                      B.B.
          Gorgeous.



                    BILL
          Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
          gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.



                    BILL
          You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
          Daddy.



                      B.B.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?



          BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
    (to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
    (to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



          B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



          BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



          B.B.
I stepped on him.



          BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



          B.B.
Yeah.



           BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
    (beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



          B.B.
He was -- flapping.



          BILL
And then you stomped on him?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?



           B.B.
Nothing.



          BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
What did that mean?

          B.B.
He was dead.



          BILL
    (to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
    (to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



            B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



          B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?



          BILL
Worse.
    (making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



            B.B.
Why?



          BILL
I don't know.



          B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?



            BILL
No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



          B.B.
What happened?

                    BILL
          I was very sad. And that was when I
          learned, somethings once you do,
          they can never be undone.



                    B.B.
          What happened to Mommy?



                    BILL
          Why don't you ask Mommy.



                    B.B.
          Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



                    BILL
          No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



                    B.B.
          Did it make you sick?



                    MOMMY
          It put me to sleep. That's why I
          haven't been with you B.B., I've
          been asleep.



                    B.B.
          But you're awake now, right?



                    MOMMY
          I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.



                    BILL
          Did she go to sleep easy?



                    THE BRIDE
          It took her a little bit. She was
          excited. She's quite the little
          chatterbox.



                    BILL
          Well, if she doesn't like you, you
          got to kill her to say hello. But
          if she likes you, you can't shut
          her up. She's a chip off the ole
          blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



                      BILL
          Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



                    BILL
          C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
          fun with a couple glasses of wine
          in ya.

She gives him a look.



                    BILL
              (pointing towards the
               beach)
          We're going to go out there and
          have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



                    BILL
          Well, I've already had    a glass. So
          unless you want to win    by an unfair
          advantage, you should    have a glass
          of wine. So we're both    on the same
          footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



                    BILL
          You know, there's an old man down
          here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
          He was a pimp. I knew him when I
          was a child. He was a friend of my
          mother's. I told him about you.
          When I showed him your picture he
          smiles and said;
              (imitating his accent)
          "Yesss, I see the attraction." He
          told me a story about taking me to
          the movies when I was five. It was
          a movie which had Lana Turner in
          it. And whenever she would appear
          on screen, he said I would stick my
          thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
          an obscure amount. And he knew
          right then, this boy will be a fool
          for blondes.



                    THE BRIDE
          Who would of ever thought you'd be
          such a good father?



                    BILL
          Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.



                    THE BRIDE
          Must we have to endure your little
          zingers?



                    BILL
          No we mustn't. But if you're going
          to say sentences like that, in the
          future, I will resist the
          temptation.



                    THE BRIDE
          Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

                    BILL
          I sent you to L.A. and you never
          came back. I thought you'd been
          killed. Do you know how cruel it is
          to make someone think someone they
          love is dead? I mourned you. Then
          in the third month of my mourning,
          I track you down. I wasn't trying
          to track you down, I was trying to
          track down - the fucking assholes -
          who I thought killed you. And when
          I find you, what to I find? Not
          only are you not dead, you're
          getting married - to some fuckin
          jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
          you expect me to react?



                    THE BRIDE
          Why do you think I hid?



                    BILL
          Why did you leave in the first
          place? You have cold eyes towards
          me now. I understand their
          temperature, but they were warm the
          second to the last time I saw them,
          or was that just my imagination?



                       THE BRIDE
          No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          You sent me to L.A. to kill that
          lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



                    BILL (ENGLISH)
          You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

          THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



          BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



          THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



          BILL
But you never did.



          THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



          BILL
My apologies, please continue.



          THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to

          kill me in my hotel room. As I was
          dancing in euphoria, the killer
          came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello, can I help you?



                    HOTEL WOMAN
          Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
          hospitality manager of the hotel. I
          have a welcome gift from the
          management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
          busy at this second, could you
          possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



                    KAREN
          So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
          huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
          I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
          to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



                    THE BRIDE
          Wait a second!

Karen stops.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
          come here to kill your sister. But
          I'm not gonna do that now.



                    KAREN
          Oh, I know you're not --



                    THE BRIDE
          - listen to me! I just found out,
          right now - not two minutes before
          you blew a hole in the door, I'm
          pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".



                    THE BRIDE
          On that table is the    home pregnancy
          kit. On the floor by    the door is
          the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
          I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
          want to and I won't    kill your
          sister. I just want    to go home.

                    KAREN
          What is this, bullshit story number
          twelve in the female assassin's
          handbook?



                    THE BRIDE
          Any other time you'd be a hundred
          percent right. But this time you're
          a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
          deadliest woman in the world, but
          right now I'm scared shitless for
          my baby. Please, you hafta believe
          me. Look at the strip, it's on the
          floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



                    KAREN
          Sit down on that bed and put your
          hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Blue means pregnant.



                    KAREN
          I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



                     KAREN
          Okay, say I were to believe you,
          what then?



                    THE BRIDE
          Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

                    KAREN
          You fucked with the Wong sisters.



BACK ON THE PORCH



                    THE BRIDE
          Facing Karen Wong, was the most
          frightening moment I have ever
          experienced. And that includes
          three years with that evil bastard
          Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
          blue, I was a woman, I was your
          woman. I was a killer, who killed
          for you. Before that strip turned
          blue, I would have jumped a
          motorcycle on to a speeding train
          ...for you. But once that strip
          turned blue, I could no longer do
          any of those things. Not anymore.
          Because now I was a mother. A
          mother who only had one thought on
          her mind. Please don't harm my
          baby. Can you understand that?



                    BILL
          Yes. But why tell me now, and not
          then?



                    THE BRIDE
          You wouldn't have let me go.
          Specially once you found out I was
          pregnant. You would've tried to
          talk me out of it. It would have
          been a big scene. I just said fuck
          it.

Starting to get mad.



                       BILL
          Fuck who?



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, you couldn't know I was
          pregnant, once you knew, you'd
          claim it, and I didn't want that.

                    BILL
          That's not your decision to make.



                     THE BRIDE
          Yes, but it's the right decision.
          And I made it for my daughter.
          Everybody on this earth deserves to
          start with a clean slate. But with
          us - my daughter would be born into
          a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
          her of the one thing everybody
          deserves. She would be born with
          blood stains. I had to choose. I
          chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



                     THE BRIDE
          You know five years ago, if I had
          to make a list of impossible things
          that could never happen.
          You performing a coup de grace on
          me by bustin a cap in my crown,
          would be right at the top of the
          list.
              (beat)
          I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;



                    BILL
          I'm sorry was that a question? Of
          impossible things that could never
          happen - yes in this instance you
          would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;



                       THE BRIDE
          Well?



                       BILL
          Well what?



                    THE BRIDE
          Explain yourself.

                    BILL
          I already have. When I told you the
          story of when I thought you were
          dead. Didn't you get how badly I
          felt?



                    THE BRIDE
          You call that an explanation?



                     BILL
          Well if that's too cryptic let's
          get literal.
              (beat)
          There are consequences to breaking
          the heart of a murdering bastard.
          You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



                    THE BRIDE
          You and I have unfinished business.



                    BILL
          Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



                     BILL
          You know how proud I am of you,
          don't you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.



                     BILL
          You know I was rooting for you,
          don't you?

                       THE BRIDE
          I figured.



                    BILL
          You know on that beach out there I
          want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



                    BILL
          You also know you're going to have
          to defeat me. I can't just give it
          to you, even though I want to.



                    THE BRIDE
          It won't be necessary for you to
          give me anything. I've surpassed
          you. I'll take it.



                    BILL
          Well, as they say in Missouri, show
          me.



EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



                       THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



                    BILL
              (to himself)
          That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



                       BILL

          He taught you the ten point palm
          exploding heart technique?



                    THE BRIDE
          Of course he did.



                    BILL
          Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't know...Because...I'm
          a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



                    BILL
          No. You're not a bad person. You're
          a terrific person. You're my
          favorite person. But every once in
          awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.

       FADE IN:

       INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY

       Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi 
       zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.

       Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the 
       cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic 
       loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not 
       permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that 
       they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other 
       automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get 
       their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is 
       Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".

       Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE 
       UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes 
       shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red 
       hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.

       He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy 
       going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.

                           ZED
                 Hotel Mondial.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Le Mondial.  Tres bien.

       He starts driving.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un 
                 moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause 
                 du 14 Juillet.

       He drives for a while.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 [Do you mind the radio?]

       Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also 
       looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du 
       Bois.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 [Do you want me to turn the radio off?]

                           ZED
                     (realizing he's being asked a 
                      question)
                 I don't speak French.

       The driver turns around.

                           CAB DRIVER
                     (in broken English)
                 Ah.  American?

                           ZED
                 That's right.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 That's good because I speak a little 
                 English.

       Zed nods.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 I asked if you mind the radio.  Music.  
                 You know.

       Zed shakes his head "no".

                           CAB DRIVER
                     (with a smile)
                 Super cool.

       Zed adjusts his watch.

                           ZED
                 What time is it?

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Time, time, time.  I don't know.  
                 Daytime.

       Zed forgets the adjustment for now.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Are you in town for business?

                           ZED
                 Yes.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big 
                 rooms.

       He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Do you know Paris?

                           ZED
                 I've been here once before.  When I was 
                 younger.

       The cab driver smiles.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Those were the days.

       They drive for a while.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Married?

                           ZED
                 I beg your pardon?

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Do you have a wife?

                           ZED
                 No.
                     (then after thinking about it 
                      for a while)
                 Why?

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Well, if you need a wife for the night...
                     (searching for the right words 
                      in French)
                 Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter.
                     (then back to his broken 
                      English)
                 For business.  I give you my number.  
                 Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you 
                 were young.

       He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger 
       tightly extended together, then he crosses them.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Know what I mean?

       Zed smiles at this and nods.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 Speaks the language of love.  Take you to 
                 heaven and back.  You just tell me and I 
                 set it up.

       Zed shakes his head and laughs.

                           CAB DRIVER
                 What you laughing at?  You let Moises set 
                 it up.  She treat you right.  She treat 
                 you fine.

       Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

       INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY

       A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From 
       around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.

       Zed is right behind him.

       They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

       The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, 
       walks into the room.

       He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and 
       proceeds to show him the room.

       Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.

                           BELLBOY
                     (in broken English)
                 Your package...It arrived in the last 
                 night of before last night.

       He points to the telephone.

                           BELLBOY
                 Ah...telephone, for the room service.

       He motions toward the bathroom.

                           BELLBOY
                 The toilet.

       He opens the closet door.

                           BELLBOY
                 To hang the clothes.

       He points to a control console next to the bed.

                           BELLBOY
                 From here you can operate the television.

       Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.

       Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, 
       he starts fingering through it.

       Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which 
       bills to give him.

                           BELLBOY
                     (after getting what he wanted)
                 Merci.

       He starts to leave.

                           ZED
                 Oh, wait.

       The bellboy turns around.

                           ZED
                 What time is it?

                           BELLBOY
                     (confused)
                 What time is it?

                           ZED
                     (pointing at his watch)
                 Time.

                           BELLBOY
                 Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures 
                 moins dix.

       The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.

       Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, 
       and takes a seat on the bed.

       Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit 
       and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he 
       dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on 
       the bedside table.

       He is asleep.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY

       Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.  
       Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside 
       of it is a black steel briefcase.

       The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.

       On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.  
       Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of 
       folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:  
       45.63.53.37.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

       Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his 
       face and cascade down his body.

       He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits 
       some out with a spurt.

       Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.

       He turns the shower off.

       Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

       Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his 
       way toward the knocking.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

       Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped 
       around his waist.  He opens it.

       In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than 
       twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but 
       she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.

                           ZOEY
                 Bonjour.

                           ZED
                     (a little awkwardly)
                 Bonjour.

       Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the 
       room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way 
       to the window for a view of the city.

                           ZOEY
                 Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne 
                 suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.

       She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to 
       examine every detail of the room.

                           ZOEY
                 Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la 
                 nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra 
                 porter un--

                           ZED
                 I...don't speak French.

       She blows a bubble.

                           ZOEY
                 It's okay.

       She takes a seat on the bed.

                           ZOEY
                 It will be one thousand francs for all 
                 night.  In advance.

       Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.

                           ZOEY
                 We can do it now if you want.

                           ZED
                 Well, let me just dry up.

                           ZOEY
                 Okay, but it's not necessary.

       He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.

       She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the 
       television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes 
       on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station 
       playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu".  She 
       smiles and sits back to watch.

                           ZED(O.S.)
                     (from the bathroom)
                 What's your name?

                           ZOEY
                 Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.

                           ZED(O.S.)
                 My name's Zed.

                           ZOEY
                     (smiling at this)
                 That's funny.  We both have Z names.

       Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His 
       pants are on.

                           ZED
                 What was that?

       She notices his pants.

                           ZOEY
                 You can take those off.  The pants.

                           ZED
                 I'd rather watch you get undressed first.

                           ZOEY
                     (matter-of-factly)
                 Alright.

       She stands up and starts to lift her top off.  He stops her.

                           ZED
                 Slower.

       He lays down on the bed.

       She stands there looking at him and then smiles.

                           ZOEY
                 Alright Mister America.  Zed.

       Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she 
       slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her 
       eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.

                           ZOEY
                 Slow enough for you?

       Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the 
       bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.

       She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin 
       to make love.

       On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.

       Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't 
       resist during a moment of passion.

       She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.  An IMAGE 
       overcomes her mind.

       They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both 
       satisfied.

       She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.

                           ZOEY
                 C'etait formidable.

       She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.

       They rest there for a while...holding each other.

                           ZOEY
                 I'm cold.

       She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.

                           ZOEY
                 Zed?

                           ZED
                 Yes?

                           ZOEY
                 Moises told me you were in town for 
                 business.

                           ZED
                 Yes.

                           ZOEY
                 What kind of business?

                           ZED
                 Why?

                           ZOEY
                 I don't know.  I'm just curious.

                           ZED
                 Do you ask all your clients questions?

                           ZOEY
                 No.  Just the ones I like.

                           ZED
                 So you like me?

                           ZOEY
                 Yes.

                           ZED
                 Why?

                           ZOEY
                 Because you're...a good person.  I run 
                 into some real creeps.  You know.

                           ZED
                 How do you know I'm a good person?

                           ZOEY
                 Body language.  We fit together.

                           ZED
                 All men and women fit together.  Hell, 
                 even some men fit together.

                           ZOEY
                 No, but you know, we clicked.  You made 
                 me orgasm.  Do you know how often I 
                 orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?

                           ZED
                 No I don't.

                           ZOEY
                 Usually never.  They're almost always fat 
                 like pigs.

       Zed laughs at this.

                           ZOEY
                 And you make me feel safe.  That's 
                 something more important than the orgasm.  
                 An integral part maybe of the orgasm.

                           ZED
                 I never really thought of it like that.

                           ZOEY
                 Well, it's true.

       Zed nods at this.

                           ZOEY
                 Turn off the television.

       Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.

                           ZOEY
                 So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like 
                 you very much.

                           ZED
                 Well, I like you too Zoe.

                           ZOEY
                 Honest?

       He nods.

                           ZOEY
                 Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can 
                 orgasm.  Even with his own hand.

       Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.

                           ZED
                 Well, I like your honesty.  You're open.  
                 Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.

       She doesn't like the sound of this.  She slaps him.

                           ZOEY
                 I am not a prostitute!

       Zed is a little surprised at this.

                           ZED
                 Really?  Can I have my francs back then?

                           ZOEY
                 I'm a student.  And to pay for the 
                 classes I became an escort.  It's my 
                 choice to sleep with you.

                           ZED
                 I see.

                           ZOEY
                 What?  You don't understand.

                           ZED
                 No, I do.

                           ZOEY
                 Hey, it's not easy.

                           ZED
                 I didn't say it was.

                           ZOEY
                 I'm here because I want to.

                           ZED
                 Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go 
                 to?

                           ZOEY
                 The Centre du Art, Paris.

                           ZED
                 That's really interesting.  What kind of 
                 art do you study?

                           ZOEY
                 Not any of the old shit.

                           ZED
                 Oh.

                           ZOEY
                 I have a day job too.  Three times a 
                 week.

       She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as 
       she talks to Zed.

                           ZOEY
                 But someday there will be only my art.

                           ZED
                 What kind of things do you paint?

                           ZOEY
                 I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects.  
                 Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with 
                 no narrative.  I want when someone looks 
                 at one of my objects for there to be no 
                 reference to the world.  Void of feeling, 
                 emotion...void of destiny.  Those are 
                 left for me.  They belong only to me.  If 
                 someone else can see into it...then it is 
                 no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I 
                 would destroy it.  I don't care how much 
                 cash they would offer me.  It would be 
                 shit.  I can't tell you how many objects 
                 of mine have been destroyed.  They told 
                 too much about me.  And if someone wants 
                 to know something about me...I'll tell 
                 them myself.  The way I'm telling you.

       She looks back at him.

                           ZOEY
                 What I do I do only for the objects.

                           ZED
                 I'd like to see one of these.

                           ZOEY
                 What?  So you could see the work of a 
                 whore?

       He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.

                           ZED
                 Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a 
                 prostitute.  I didn't understand the 
                 difference.

                           ZOEY
                 The difference is a prostitute would have 
                 lied to you about her orgasm.

       He gives her a kiss.

                           ZED
                 If these things you make are as true as 
                 you are...I'm sure they're as 
                 indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll 
                 make one...about me.

                           ZOEY
                 If I do...you'll never know which one it 
                 is.  Because I'll be the only one who 
                 understands.  I'll be the only one who 
                 can look into it and see where in my life 
                 it came from.

       Zed is unable to speak.  They look into each others eyes for 
       a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in 
       through the window.  Then she leans forward and gives him a 
       soft understanding kiss.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

       INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT

       Zed is asleep.  Zoey is asleep in his arms.

       There is a knocking at the door.

       Zed opens his eyes.

       The knock becomes a pound.

       Zed gets up and puts on his pants.  Zoey gets up and looks 
       around.

                           ZOEY
                     (groggily)
                 What time is it?

                           ZED
                 I have no idea.  Night time.

       There is more pounding on the door.

                           ZOEY
                 I'm going to take a shower.

       She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.

       Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.

       Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age 
       wearing baggy French-style clothes.

                           ERIC
                     (with a thick accent)
                 Hey you madman!

       Zed's happy to see him.

                           ZED
                 Eric.  Come in.

       They hug.

                           ERIC
                 What happened to you?  I thought you were 
                 going to call.

       Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love 
       making around the room.

                           ERIC
                     (smiling)
                 Oh I see.  You have been busy.

                           ZED
                 Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a 
                 wake up call.

                           ERIC
                 That's good, but now I am here.  So let's 
                 go.  We have a lot to talk about.

                           ZED
                 What about the girl?

                           ERIC
                 Is she your girlfriend?

                           ZED
                 No.

                           ERIC
                 Fuck her.

       He peeks into the bathroom.

                           ERIC
                 She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out.

                           ZED
                 I'll let her stay here tonight.

                           ERIC
                 Don't be silly.  It's dangerous.

       Eric walks into the bathroom.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

       Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door.  Zoey is 
       obviously surprised to see him.

                           ERIC
                     (in French with English 
                      subtitles)
                 [Okay.  Get out of the shower.  It's time 
                 for you to leave.]

                           ZOEY
                 [Fuck you.]

       Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.

                           ERIC
                 [No.  Come on you fucking slut!]

       She shrieks.

                           ZOEY
                 [Let go of me you shit!!]

       He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

       Zed can't believe this.

                           ZED
                 Eric.

                           ERIC
                     (to Zed)
                 Don't worry about her.
                     (to Zoey in French)
                 [Why don't you just go back to your pimp 
                 and suck his black dick!]

       She bites his hand.  He yells in pain.

                           ERIC
                 God damn it!

       He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.

                           ERIC
                 [Get the fuck out of here you fucking 
                 whore!]

       He opens the door and throws her into the hall.

       INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT

       Naked, Zoey falls into the hall.

       Eric slams the door shut.

       She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds 
       on the door.

                           ZOEY
                 [Give me my clothes you asshole!]

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

       She is pounding on the door.

                           ERIC
                     (looking at his hand wound)
                 God damn it.  Look at my hand.

                           ZED
                     (shocked at the whole incident)
                 Jesus Eric.

                           ZOEY(O.S.)
                 Ouvres!  Je veux mes habits!

       Eric listens.

                           ERIC
                 Oh shit.  Her clothes.

       He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and 
       throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at 
       him.

                           ZOEY
                     (almost too quick to 
                      understand)
                 Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?

                           ERIC
                 La ferme!

       He slams the door shut.

       Then he turns to Zed.

                           ERIC
                 So tell me, what have you been up to?

       Zed sits down on the bed.

                           ZOEY(O.S.)
                 Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!

                           ZED
                 Eric, I liked that girl.

                           ERIC
                 Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me.

                           ZED
                 Because you were on a rampage.

                           ERIC
                 Look, your whole life you've done nothing 
                 but fuck whores.  A girl like that will 
                 give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice 
                 girl in the suburbs?

                           ZED
                 Because when you need to get off you 
                 don't want to have to date for months to 
                 do it.

                           ERIC
                 Just use your hand like me.

                           ZED
                 Sometimes you just need honesty...and 
                 security.

                           ERIC
                 I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too 
                 late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet 
                 the boys.

                           ZED
                 Okay, let me take a shower.

                           ERIC
                 No, in Paris it's good to smell like 
                 you've been fucking.  It will make them 
                 respect you.

                           ZED
                 Oh.

                           ERIC
                 Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.

       Zed starts to get dressed

       EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT

       The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue 
       Soufflot is bustling.

       Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past 
       the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.

       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in 
       Eric's car.  The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is 
       playing on the radio.

                           ERIC
                 I'm glad you came.  How long has it been?

                           ZED
                 Years.

                           ERIC
                 It's amazing, you know?  Here you are.  
                 One day in America.  Now here.

                           ZED
                 Well, to be honest there really wasn't 
                 much happening for me in the states.

                           ERIC
                 But in Paris your old friend Eric has a 
                 job for you, so you came.  That's good.

                           ZED
                 How could I resist your invitation?

                           ERIC
                 You would have been stupid to.

                           ZED
                 So what have you been doing here?

                           ERIC
                 After school I spent some time in Algeria 
                 studying African philosophy.  And then I 
                 bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For 
                 a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The 
                 newspaper.

                           ZED
                 Really?

                           ERIC
                 Yes.  With an assumed Masters degree.  
                 And lately we have just been bombing 
                 fascists here in Paris.  You know, like 
                 terrorists.

       Zed looks over at him.

                           ERIC
                 It's fun.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT

       Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where 
       Eric's flat is.  On the top landing there is a dead cat 
       laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the 
       door.

       There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.

                           ERIC
                 The people next door are on holiday.  We 
                 took their phone.  If you want to make a 
                 long distance call, go ahead.

                           ZED
                 Is that cat dead?

                           ERIC
                 I don't know.  I think it's asleep but 
                 it's been there for days.

       Eric gives it a kick.  No response.

                           ERIC
                 I guess it is dead.

       They walk into the flat.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

                           ERIC
                 Hello.

       They all return the greeting.

                           ERIC
                     (to Zed)
                 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, 
                 Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?

                           ZED
                 I will.

                           ERIC
                 They all know who you are.
                     (to the rest of them)
                 Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au 
                 plus grand perceur de coffres.

       Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.

                           OLIVER
                     (with an English accent)
                 Zed, would you like a beer?

                           ZED
                 Thanks.

                           OLIVER
                 Don't think of it.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Zed)
                 Come.  Sit down.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

       The kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in 
       the sink and on the counter.

       Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties 
       it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer 
       into the glass.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

       Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam 
       costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto 
       his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

       Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Zed)
                 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to 
                 claim you.

       Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto 
       Claude's shoulder.

                           CLAUDE
                 Let me introduce you properly.  This is 
                 Enrique.

       The monkey screeches.

                           CLAUDE
                 He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we 
                 don't always get what we like...do we?

       Again, the hideous creature screeches.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Enrique)
                 Tais-toi!
                     (then to Zed)
                 Do you like hash?

       Then Eric interrupts.

                           ERIC
                     (jokingly)
                 Don't sit next to that junkie.

                           CLAUDE
                 Ahhhhhh!

       Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a 
       mass of sparks.  They laugh.

                           ERIC
                     (to Claude)
                 That little shit monkey of yours pissed 
                 on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time 
                 he's out the door.
                     (to Zed)
                 Zed, come here.

       Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way 
       Oliver hands him the glass of beer.

                           OLIVER
                 Here you go mate.

                           ZED
                 Thanks.

       Oliver sits down next to Claude.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Eric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room 
       looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, 
       there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a 
       blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.

                           ERIC
                 Don't ask me where we got this.

                           ZED
                 Okay.

                           ERIC
                 On Bastille Day, all the banks are 
                 closed.

       He places his hand on the blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 But this one.  BIP.  The Banque 
                 Internationale de Paris.  And for being 
                 greedy capitalists perhaps they will 
                 remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

       Zed smiles.

                           ERIC
                 We will go in and shut the bank down.  
                 Now, look at this.

       Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.

                           ERIC
                 As you can see, only one person can start 
                 the alarm.
                     (he hands it to Zed)
                 The concierge, at this desk.
                     (he points it out on the 
                      blueprint)
                 We will take care of him.  Then we can 
                 close the bank.  No one will know the 
                 difference since every other bank will be 
                 closed.

                           ZED
                     (turning the schematic around)
                 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

                           ERIC
                 Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd 
                 have to be totally incompetent not to 
                 stop him.  Don't worry about that.

       He points to the main floor vault.

                           ERIC
                 Here.  This is where they keep the days 
                 reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

       He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 There are many vaults downstairs, but 
                 this is the vault we must get into.  This 
                 is where the real prize is.

                           ZED
                 What kind of vault is that?

       He checks the blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber.

                           ZED
                 Caliber?
                     (he thinks about it)
                 It'll take three hours.

                           ERIC
                 No, that's too long.

                           ZED
                 That's how long it'll take.

                           ERIC
                 Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be 
                 in and out.
                     (he snaps his fingers)
                 Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.  
                 A little time is okay...but too long 
                 and...

       He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

                           ZED
                 Well hold on a second.
                     (pointing to the blueprint)
                 What's this?

       Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage 
       connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.

                           ERIC
                 Another vault.

                           ZED
                 No this.

       Eric looks closely at the blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 I don't know...it connects the two 
                 vaults.

                           ZED
                 Well, what kind of vault is this other 
                 one?

                           ERIC
                     (reading the blueprint)
                 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.

                           ZED
                 Why would those two vaults be connected?

                           ERIC
                 I don't know.

                           ZED
                 Because I can get into this vault in half 
                 an hour.  Maybe less.

                           ERIC
                 But this entry way is too small to get 
                 the platen out.  We have a lot of 
                 merchandise in there.

                           ZED
                 No, don't you see?  We get in through 
                 this secondary vault and take this 
                 passage to the other main vault.  From 
                 the inside I could open the Caliber vault 
                 in five minutes.

                           ERIC
                 You could open it in five minutes?

                           ZED
                 From the inside it's easy.

                           ERIC
                     (excited)
                 Hot damn.  That is our answer.

                           ZED
                 Okay.  When is Bastille day?

                           ERIC
                 Tomorrow.

                           ZED
                 Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow?

                           ERIC
                 But of course.

                           ZED
                 It's impossible.

                           ERIC
                 It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what 
                 to do.

                           ZED
                 I don't know what to do.

                           ERIC
                 You don't need to know shit.  Just get 
                 into the vault and we'll do the rest.

                           ZED
                 I haven't even seen the bank.

                           ERIC
                 Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we 
                 live life.  It's better that way.  Okay?

                           ZED
                     (unsure)
                 Okay.

                           ERIC
                 Good.  Now we do heroin!

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

       EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

       The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon 
       squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled 
       around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.

                           OLIVER
                     (so high he's wobbling)
                 You have to look at the Starship 
                 Enterprise as a metaphor for the human 
                 brain.

       No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a 
       lighter and cooks it to a boil.

                           OLIVER
                     (continuing)
                 Spock is the right hemisphere of the 
                 brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is 
                 the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.  
                 And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He 
                 drifts between the two.  Back and forth, 
                 as it might be, caught between the two 
                 thought processes.

                           ERIC
                 [Cotton.]

       Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.

                           OLIVER
                     (continuing)
                 It's really quite brilliant you know.  
                 That's why Star Trek is and always will 
                 be a hit show.

       Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.

                           ERIC
                     (to Oliver)
                 [Here, shut up and hold this.]

       He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the 
       cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

       Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

                           ERIC
                 [Don't want to get air bubbles in my 
                 veins.]

       They all laugh at this.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and 
       Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean 
       is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small 
       picture.

                           JEAN
                 Do you want heroin?

                           ZED
                 No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

       Jean and Claude laugh at this.

                           JEAN
                 No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a 
                 beer...and you're just right.

       Jean snorts a line.

       Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".

                           CLAUDE
                 Okay.

                           JEAN
                     (recovering from the snort)
                 That's good.

       Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen 
       laughing.

       Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite 
       Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

       Eric rolls up his sleeve.

                           ERIC
                     (to Ricardo in French)
                 [Hold my arm.]
                     (then to Zed)
                 My vein is like a rock.

       Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the 
       needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes 
       with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the 
       syringe, then all the way back in.

       He withdraws the needle.

       Ricardo lets go of his arm.

       Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He 
       looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

       Then Jean takes another snort.

       Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting 
       up, and drinking more beer.

       Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some 
       heroin in it.

                           JEAN
                     (to Zed)
                 Try some.  It's called chasing the 
                 dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it 
                 for centuries.

                           ZED
                 I don't think so.

                           JEAN
                 Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel 
                 as though the rest of the world is in a 
                 bubble of glass and that you're rubbing 
                 up against it like a bad windshield 
                 wiper.

       They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to 
       his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a 
       lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon 
       of smoke.

       Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

                                                  FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:

       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris 
       weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in 
       the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very 
       stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.

       A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, 
       with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the 
       streets.

       The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting 
       away on the radio.

                           ERIC
                 There.  That's Notre Dame.

       But before Zed can even look it has past by.

                           RICARDO
                 Do you like French cars?

       All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 
       kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in 
       miles per hour.

                           ZED
                     (answering Enrique's question)
                 Yes.

                           RICARDO
                 I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to 
                 seventy-five.  Very nice.

                           ERIC
                 Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.

       Zed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric.

                           ZED
                 Is tomorrow really Bastille day?

                           ERIC
                 Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in 
                 French history.  And spend the rest of 
                 our lives in Monte Carlo.

       The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.

       EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT

       The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.

       INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it 
       is they're going to.

       Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.

                           CLAUDE
                 [Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat 
                 them!]

       Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.

       EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT

       Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and 
       cuts off Ricardo.

       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.

                           RICARDO
                 [Shit!  That bastard.]

                           ERIC
                     (to Ricardo)
                 Watch it!  Don't crash my car.

       Eric takes a big hit.

                           ERIC
                 Over here is where the male prostitutes 
                 sell themselves.  Do you see?

       No, Zed doesn't see.

       Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.

                           OLIVER
                     (out the window)
                 Fucking fags!

                           ERIC
                     (also out the window)
                 Suce ma bite?!

                           RICARDO
                 Perverts d'homosexuels!

       Eric laughs.

                           ERIC
                     (into Zed's ear)
                 This is good to have you here.  We could 
                 not do this without you.

       Zed nods.

                           ERIC
                 Everyone has agreed to give you double 
                 shares.  That's good.

       Zed nods, delirious.

                           ERIC
                 You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.

       Zed can't believe this.  He's not sure if what he heard was 
       what he thought he heard.

                           ZED
                 Really?

       Then Eric sees something.

                           ERIC
                 Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.

       They take a sharp turn.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CELLAR - NIGHT

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables 
       scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for 
       great acoustics.

       ON STAGE

       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

       AT THE BUFFET

       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been 
       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and 
       JOSEPHINE.

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle 
       and Josephine.

       Eric hands them some money.

       ZED'S TABLE

       Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.  
       Oliver sits next to Zed.

                           OLIVER
                 So, how long have you known Eric?

                           ZED
                 Well, Eric's mother is American.

                           OLIVER
                 Yeah, and his dad's French.

                           ZED
                 They're divorced.  And she and his father 
                 had some kind of six month split plan set 
                 up.  So every six months he would come 
                 back to the states.  We were best 
                 friends.  Eventually he and his mother 
                 had a falling out and he stayed here.  
                 It's been...years.

                           OLIVER
                 Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric 
                 speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he 
                 says you're a big fan of Viking films.

                           ZED
                 Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I 
                 was young.

                           OLIVER
                 Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns 
                 on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

       He starts laughing.

                           OLIVER
                 How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

       Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.

                           ZED
                 Yeah...I guess.

                           OLIVER
                 I love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and 
                 culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz 
                 for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.  
                 Total purity of essence.

                           ZED
                 Yeah.

                           OLIVER
                 Hungry cannibals'd like it.

       Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle 
       of red wine.

                           CLAUDE
                 Here, you must drink some of this wine, 
                 it's good.

       He pours Zed a glass.

       Oliver passes on the wine.

                           OLIVER
                     (to Claude)
                 Non merci, c'est de la merde.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Oliver)
                 La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.
                     (to Zed)
                 The fucking English.

       Zed sips some.  He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's 
       good or not.

       ON STAGE

       Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a 
       delirium of music.

       The band stands up.

       IN THE AUDIENCE

       The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats 
       then right in front of everything.

       ZED'S TABLE

       Suddenly, Zed notices something...

       ON STAGE

       Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the 
       band.

       ZED'S TABLE

       Zed blinks but it's true.

       Oliver and Claude start laughing.

                           OLIVER
                 Look at him.  He's crazy.

       ON STAGE

       And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up 
       with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

       Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running 
       down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

       ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the 
       stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like 
       James Brown.

       Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back 
       to a musician.

       The set is over.

       Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, 
       Claude, and Zed are sitting.

       EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT

       The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue 
       Soufflot is bustling.

       Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past 
       the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.

       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in 
       Eric's car.  The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is 
       playing on the radio.

                           ERIC
                 I'm glad you came.  How long has it been?

                           ZED
                 Years.

                           ERIC
                 It's amazing, you know?  Here you are.  
                 One day in America.  Now here.

                           ZED
                 Well, to be honest there really wasn't 
                 much happening for me in the states.

                           ERIC
                 But in Paris your old friend Eric has a 
                 job for you, so you came.  That's good.

                           ZED
                 How could I resist your invitation?

                           ERIC
                 You would have been stupid to.

                           ZED
                 So what have you been doing here?

                           ERIC
                 After school I spent some time in Algeria 
                 studying African philosophy.  And then I 
                 bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For 
                 a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The 
                 newspaper.

                           ZED
                 Really?

                           ERIC
                 Yes.  With an assumed Masters degree.  
                 And lately we have just been bombing 
                 fascists here in Paris.  You know, like 
                 terrorists.

       Zed looks over at him.

                           ERIC
                 It's fun.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT

       Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where 
       Eric's flat is.  On the top landing there is a dead cat 
       laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the 
       door.

       There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.

                           ERIC
                 The people next door are on holiday.  We 
                 took their phone.  If you want to make a 
                 long distance call, go ahead.

                           ZED
                 Is that cat dead?

                           ERIC
                 I don't know.  I think it's asleep but 
                 it's been there for days.

       Eric gives it a kick.  No response.

                           ERIC
                 I guess it is dead.

       They walk into the flat.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

                           ERIC
                 Hello.

       They all return the greeting.

                           ERIC
                     (to Zed)
                 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, 
                 Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?

                           ZED
                 I will.

                           ERIC
                 They all know who you are.
                     (to the rest of them)
                 Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au 
                 plus grand perceur de coffres.

       Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.

                           OLIVER
                     (with an English accent)
                 Zed, would you like a beer?

                           ZED
                 Thanks.

                           OLIVER
                 Don't think of it.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Zed)
                 Come.  Sit down.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

       The kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in 
       the sink and on the counter.

       Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties 
       it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer 
       into the glass.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

       Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam 
       costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto 
       his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

       Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Zed)
                 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to 
                 claim you.

       Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto 
       Claude's shoulder.

                           CLAUDE
                 Let me introduce you properly.  This is 
                 Enrique.

       The monkey screeches.

                           CLAUDE
                 He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we 
                 don't always get what we like...do we?

       Again, the hideous creature screeches.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Enrique)
                 Tais-toi!
                     (then to Zed)
                 Do you like hash?

       Then Eric interrupts.

                           ERIC
                     (jokingly)
                 Don't sit next to that junkie.

                           CLAUDE
                 Ahhhhhh!

       Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a 
       mass of sparks.  They laugh.

                           ERIC
                     (to Claude)
                 That little shit monkey of yours pissed 
                 on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time 
                 he's out the door.
                     (to Zed)
                 Zed, come here.

       Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way 
       Oliver hands him the glass of beer.

                           OLIVER
                 Here you go mate.

                           ZED
                 Thanks.

       Oliver sits down next to Claude.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Eric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room 
       looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, 
       there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a 
       blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.

                           ERIC
                 Don't ask me where we got this.

                           ZED
                 Okay.

                           ERIC
                 On Bastille Day, all the banks are 
                 closed.

       He places his hand on the blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 But this one.  BIP.  The Banque 
                 Internationale de Paris.  And for being 
                 greedy capitalists perhaps they will 
                 remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

       Zed smiles.

                           ERIC
                 We will go in and shut the bank down.  
                 Now, look at this.

       Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.

                           ERIC
                 As you can see, only one person can start 
                 the alarm.
                     (he hands it to Zed)
                 The concierge, at this desk.
                     (he points it out on the 
                      blueprint)
                 We will take care of him.  Then we can 
                 close the bank.  No one will know the 
                 difference since every other bank will be 
                 closed.

                           ZED
                     (turning the schematic around)
                 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

                           ERIC
                 Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd 
                 have to be totally incompetent not to 
                 stop him.  Don't worry about that.

       He points to the main floor vault.

                           ERIC
                 Here.  This is where they keep the days 
                 reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

       He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 There are many vaults downstairs, but 
                 this is the vault we must get into.  This 
                 is where the real prize is.

                           ZED
                 What kind of vault is that?

       He checks the blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber.

                           ZED
                 Caliber?
                     (he thinks about it)
                 It'll take three hours.

                           ERIC
                 No, that's too long.

                           ZED
                 That's how long it'll take.

                           ERIC
                 Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be 
                 in and out.
                     (he snaps his fingers)
                 Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.  
                 A little time is okay...but too long 
                 and...

       He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

                           ZED
                 Well hold on a second.
                     (pointing to the blueprint)
                 What's this?

       Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage 
       connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.

                           ERIC
                 Another vault.

                           ZED
                 No this.

       Eric looks closely at the blueprint.

                           ERIC
                 I don't know...it connects the two 
                 vaults.

                           ZED
                 Well, what kind of vault is this other 
                 one?

                           ERIC
                     (reading the blueprint)
                 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.

                           ZED
                 Why would those two vaults be connected?

                           ERIC
                 I don't know.

                           ZED
                 Because I can get into this vault in half 
                 an hour.  Maybe less.

                           ERIC
                 But this entry way is too small to get 
                 the platen out.  We have a lot of 
                 merchandise in there.

                           ZED
                 No, don't you see?  We get in through 
                 this secondary vault and take this 
                 passage to the other main vault.  From 
                 the inside I could open the Caliber vault 
                 in five minutes.

                           ERIC
                 You could open it in five minutes?

                           ZED
                 From the inside it's easy.

                           ERIC
                     (excited)
                 Hot damn.  That is our answer.

                           ZED
                 Okay.  When is Bastille day?

                           ERIC
                 Tomorrow.

                           ZED
                 Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow?

                           ERIC
                 But of course.

                           ZED
                 It's impossible.

                           ERIC
                 It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what 
                 to do.

                           ZED
                 I don't know what to do.

                           ERIC
                 You don't need to know shit.  Just get 
                 into the vault and we'll do the rest.

                           ZED
                 I haven't even seen the bank.

                           ERIC
                 Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we 
                 live life.  It's better that way.  Okay?

                           ZED
                     (unsure)
                 Okay.

                           ERIC
                 Good.  Now we do heroin!

       EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

       The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon 
       squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled 
       around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.

                           OLIVER
                     (so high he's wobbling)
                 You have to look at the Starship 
                 Enterprise as a metaphor for the human 
                 brain.

       No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a 
       lighter and cooks it to a boil.

                           OLIVER
                     (continuing)
                 Spock is the right hemisphere of the 
                 brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is 
                 the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.  
                 And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He 
                 drifts between the two.  Back and forth, 
                 as it might be, caught between the two 
                 thought processes.

                           ERIC
                 [Cotton.]

       Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.

                           OLIVER
                     (continuing)
                 It's really quite brilliant you know.  
                 That's why Star Trek is and always will 
                 be a hit show.

       Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.

                           ERIC
                     (to Oliver)
                 [Here, shut up and hold this.]

       He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the 
       cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

       Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

                           ERIC
                 [Don't want to get air bubbles in my 
                 veins.]

       They all laugh at this.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and 
       Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean 
       is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small 
       picture.

                           JEAN
                 Do you want heroin?

                           ZED
                 No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

       Jean and Claude laugh at this.

                           JEAN
                 No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a 
                 beer...and you're just right.

       Jean snorts a line.

       Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".

                           CLAUDE
                 Okay.

                           JEAN
                     (recovering from the snort)
                 That's good.

       Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen 
       laughing.

       Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite 
       Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

       Eric rolls up his sleeve.

                           ERIC
                     (to Ricardo in French)
                 [Hold my arm.]
                     (then to Zed)
                 My vein is like a rock.

       Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the 
       needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes 
       with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the 
       syringe, then all the way back in.

       He withdraws the needle.

       Ricardo lets go of his arm.

       Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He 
       looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

       Then Jean takes another snort.

       Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting 
       up, and drinking more beer.

       Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some 
       heroin in it.

                           JEAN
                     (to Zed)
                 Try some.  It's called chasing the 
                 dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it 
                 for centuries.

                           ZED
                 I don't think so.

                           JEAN
                 Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel 
                 as though the rest of the world is in a 
                 bubble of glass and that you're rubbing 
                 up against it like a bad windshield 
                 wiper.

       They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to 
       his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a 
       lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon 
       of smoke.

       Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

                                                  FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:

       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris 
       weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in 
       the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very 
       stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.

       A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, 
       with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the 
       streets.

       The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting 
       away on the radio.

                           ERIC
                 There.  That's Notre Dame.

       But before Zed can even look it has past by.

                           RICARDO
                 Do you like French cars?

       All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 
       kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in 
       miles per hour.

                           ZED
                     (answering Enrique's question)
                 Yes.

                           RICARDO
                 I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to 
                 seventy-five.  Very nice.

                           ERIC
                 Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.

       Zed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric.

                           ZED
                 Is tomorrow really Bastille day?

                           ERIC
                 Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in 
                 French history.  And spend the rest of 
                 our lives in Monte Carlo.

       The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.

       EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT

       The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.

       INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it 
       is they're going to.

       Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.

                           CLAUDE
                 [Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat 
                 them!]

       Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.

       EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT

       Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and 
       cuts off Ricardo.

       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.

                           RICARDO
                 [Shit!  That bastard.]

                           ERIC
                     (to Ricardo)
                 Watch it!  Don't crash my car.

       Eric takes a big hit.

                           ERIC
                 Over here is where the male prostitutes 
                 sell themselves.  Do you see?

       No, Zed doesn't see.

       Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.

                           OLIVER
                     (out the window)
                 Fucking fags!

                           ERIC
                     (also out the window)
                 Suce ma bite?!

                           RICARDO
                 Perverts d'homosexuels!

       Eric laughs.

                           ERIC
                     (into Zed's ear)
                 This is good to have you here.  We could 
                 not do this without you.

       Zed nods.

                           ERIC
                 Everyone has agreed to give you double 
                 shares.  That's good.

       Zed nods, delirious.

                           ERIC
                 You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.

       Zed can't believe this.  He's not sure if what he heard was 
       what he thought he heard.

                           ZED
                 Really?

       Then Eric sees something.

                           ERIC
                 Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.

       They take a sharp turn.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CELLAR - NIGHT

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables 
       scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for 
       great acoustics.

       ON STAGE

       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

       AT THE BUFFET

       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been 
       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and 
       JOSEPHINE.

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle 
       and Josephine.

       Eric hands them some money.

       ZED'S TABLE

       Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.  
       Oliver sits next to Zed.

                           OLIVER
                 So, how long have you known Eric?

                           ZED
                 Well, Eric's mother is American.

                           OLIVER
                 Yeah, and his dad's French.

                           ZED
                 They're divorced.  And she and his father 
                 had some kind of six month split plan set 
                 up.  So every six months he would come 
                 back to the states.  We were best 
                 friends.  Eventually he and his mother 
                 had a falling out and he stayed here.  
                 It's been...years.

                           OLIVER
                 Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric 
                 speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he 
                 says you're a big fan of Viking films.

                           ZED
                 Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I 
                 was young.

                           OLIVER
                 Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns 
                 on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

       He starts laughing.

                           OLIVER
                 How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

       Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.

                           ZED
                 Yeah...I guess.

                           OLIVER
                 I love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and 
                 culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz 
                 for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.  
                 Total purity of essence.

                           ZED
                 Yeah.

                           OLIVER
                 Hungry cannibals'd like it.

       Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle 
       of red wine.

                           CLAUDE
                 Here, you must drink some of this wine, 
                 it's good.

       He pours Zed a glass.

       Oliver passes on the wine.

                           OLIVER
                     (to Claude)
                 Non merci, c'est de la merde.

                           CLAUDE
                     (to Oliver)
                 La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.
                     (to Zed)
                 The fucking English.

       Zed sips some.  He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's 
       good or not.

       ON STAGE

       Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a 
       delirium of music.

       The band stands up.

       IN THE AUDIENCE

       The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats 
       then right in front of everything.

       ZED'S TABLE

       Suddenly, Zed notices something...

       ON STAGE

       Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the 
       band.

       ZED'S TABLE

       Zed blinks but it's true.

       Oliver and Claude start laughing.

                           OLIVER
                 Look at him.  He's crazy.

       ON STAGE

       And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up 
       with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

       Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running 
       down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

       ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the 
       stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like 
       James Brown.

       Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back 
       to a musician.

       The set is over.

       Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, 
       Claude, and Zed are sitting.

       EXT. BANK - DAY

       EXTREME CLOSE ON:  The door to the bank.

       Francois puts a sign on the door that reads:  [Closed for 
       Bastille Day].

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY HALL - DAY

       The sub lobby teller and the sub lobby guard #2 rendezvous 
       with the sub lobby assistant.

                           SUB LOBBY TELLER
                     (to assistant)
                 [Do the phones work?]

                           SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT
                 [They went dead.]

                           SUB LOBBY TELLER
                 Merde!

       They walk out into the sub lobby.

       INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY

       The sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into 
       the sub lobby just as Eric, Zed, Oliver, and the bank manager 
       start coming down the stairs.

       At the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims 
       his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager.

       Eric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck.

                           ERIC
                     (to the guard)
                 [Drop the gun!]

       He doesn't.

                           ERIC
                 [Drop your gun now and nobody dies!]

       After a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver 
       has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the 
       floor.

                           ERIC
                 [Good boy.]

       They descend down the stairs into the sub lobby.

       Oliver takes his gun.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

       Francois, Ricardo, and Jean have finished herding everyone 
       behind the teller windows.  Claude is on his way downstairs.

                           CLAUDE
                 [I'm going to check things out 
                 downstairs.]

                           RICARDO
                     (to the people)

       Claude comes downstairs with his gun raised.

                           CLAUDE
                 [All clear down here?]

       Everyone turns.

                           ERIC
                 [Take these two upstairs.  And chain the 
                 gate to the sub lobby shut.]

       Oliver pushes the sub lobby guard #2 and the sub lobby 
       assistant toward Claude.  Then he hands him a chain.

       Claude can barely maintain his enthusiasm.

                           CLAUDE
                 [The phones and video are down!  We're 
                 locked up tight!]
                     (then in English)
                 We fucking did it!

       He takes the two upstairs.

       Eric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager.

                           ERIC
                 [Any others I should worry about?]

                           BANK MANAGER
                 [No.]

                           ERIC
                     (to Oliver)
                 [Well, just to be sure--]

       Then, from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard.  
       All eyes turn to it.

       Oliver walks up to it and kicks the door in.  The stodgy 
       customer is kneeling in it.  He instantly holds his hands 
       high.

                           OLIVER
                 [Freeze motherfucker!]

       Eric walks up, gun in hand.

                           ERIC
                 [Who the fuck are you?]

                           STODGY CUSTOMER

                           OLIVER
                 [On the ground!]

       He does.

                     (he smiles to Oliver)
                 [Bring him with us.]

       They all make their way down through the sub lobby hall.

       INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

       They're herding the men through the hall.

                 locked.  You won't be able to open them.]

       They walk through a doorway into the storage/elevator area.

       INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

       Eric pushes the manager and the others through the doorway.

                           ERIC
                     (to the bank manager)

       Eric pushes them infront of the Calibre vault door.

                           ERIC
                 [Now save us a lot of time and just open 
                 the vault.]

                           BANK MANAGER

                           ERIC
                 [Okay.]

       He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his 
       handgun into the sub level tellers mouth.

                           ERIC
                 [Open the vault.]

       The teller's eyes widen.

                           BANK MANAGER
                 [I cannot.]

                           BANK MANAGER
                 [No.  Once closed only I can open it.]

                           ERIC

                           BANK MANAGER
                 [I cannot.]

       The sub lobby teller's eyes plead with the bank manager.

       Zed is watching the whole affair nervously.

                           ERIC
                 [Do you understand that I'll kill her if 
                 you don't open this fucking vault?]

                 international reserve bank?  Robbing it 
                 is punishable by life imprisonment.]

       Eric fires.  The back of the sub lobby teller's head paints 
       the wall red.

                           ZED
                 Jesus fucking Christ!

       The bank manager, shocked as he is, looks at Zed.  He knows 
       he's an American.

       The sub lobby teller's body slumps to the ground.

       Eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his 
       temple.

                           ERIC
                 [Open the vault door or I'll kill this

       The bank manager is freaking out, but after what was probably 
       the most horribly agonizing internal debate, he holds his 
       ground.

                           BANK MANAGER
                 [I still cannot open the vault.]

                 Eric no!  I can open the vault!

                           ERIC
                 Shut the fuck up!
                     (then to the stodgy customer)
                 [You're a customer in this bank and this 
                 is how they treat you.  Do you have a 
                 family?]

       He nods his head "yes".

                           ERIC
                 [Would you like to see them again?]

       He nods his head again.

                           ERIC
                     (to the manager)
                 [This man has a family he would like to 
                 have Bastille day dinner with tonight.  
                 So save us some time and open the vault.]

       After losing about a pound of sweat...

                           BANK MANAGER
                 [No.]

       Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and 
       fires two shots into the bank manager's face.

       The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the 
       floor.

                           ERIC
                 Fucking idiot.
                     (then to the stodgy customer)
                 [You seem like a nice man.  Tonight at 
                 dinner think about how lucky you are and 
                 how much you love your family.]

       He starts nodding his head.

                           STODGY CUSTOMER
                 Oui.

                           ERIC
                     (to Oliver)
                 [Take him upstairs.]

       Oliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people.

       Eric rips off his mask.

                           ERIC
                 Don't you ever conflict with me during 
                 work again!  Do you hear!?

       Zed off his clown mask.

                 in charge now.  Nobody told me.
                     (his temper flares)
                 If he had opened the vault it would have 
                 saved us a fucking hour.

       He charges into the reserve vault area.

                 Eric.  It's just that we've gone from 
                 being thieves to murderers.

                           ZED
                 I thought the death penalty was abolished 
                 in 1980?

                           ERIC
                 Ohhhh!  That's what they tell you!  But 
                 who cares?  I need to take a piss.

       Eric enters the bathroom.

                 Why don't you open the vault?

       Zed looks at the bathroom door close.  After a fuming pause 
       he turns and walks back toward the Poseidon vault door.

                 his fifty francs on the front desk, he

                           RICARDO
                 ["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, 
                 pulling him out of his chair by the shirt 
                 collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I 
                 want it now!"]

       The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.

                           RICARDO
                 ["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, 
                 "I'll see what I can do."  So the ex-con 
                 followed him through to the very back of 
                 the warehouse through some stained, 
                 tattered red curtains, and into a grimy 
                 little room where a bedraggled looking 
                 whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed.  
                 "She's yours for fifty francs," said the 
                 proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]

       Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an 
       ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it.  His fingers 
       begin to unsnap the safety harness on it.

       Her eyes widen.

                           RICARDO
                 [After a little while, he came across a 
                 piece of egg.  "That's funny," he thought 
                 to himself, "I don't think I had egg for 
                 breakfast."  But he spat it out and kept 
                 eating away.  Next he found a piece of 
                 chipped beef wedged between his front 
                 teeth.  "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped 
                 beef this week," he thought, but kept on.  
                 Then he came across the corn.  "What is 
                 this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be 
                 sick."]

       The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety.  Zoey knows 
       he's going to make his move.

                           RICARDO
                 ["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what 
                 the last guy said."]

       Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips 
       out the .38 and fires three shots.

       Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest.  He falls to the 
       ground.

       The other hits Francois in the arm.

       In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group 
       of people huddled on the floor.

       Everyone is screaming and trying to get away.

       Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard 
       killing him dead.

       Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three 
       of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, 
       killing them all.

       People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the 
       ceiling.

                           CLAUDE
                 [No one fucking moves!]

       Jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people.

                           JEAN
                 [Shit!  What happened!?]

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

       Zed looks up hearing the commotion.

       Eric comes running out of the bathroom and into the 
       storage/elevator area.

                           ERIC
                 What is it?  What's going on?

       Zed gets up to go upstairs.             

                           ZED            
                 I don't know.

                           ERIC
                 No!  You stay here.

       Eric runs upstairs.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

       Francois is on the ground holding his arm.  He keeps rolling 
       back and forth in pain.

       Ricardo is dead.

       Jean, Claude, and Oliver are waving their guns around ready 
       to kill someone any second.

                           JEAN
                 [Nobody fucking moves!  Nobody fucking 
                 moves!]

       Claude motions to the dead security guard.

                           CLAUDE
                 [The gun!  Somebody get it!]

       Oliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time 
       waving his gun at people.

                           OLIVER
                 [Don't fuck with me!  Don't fuck with 
                 me!]

       He grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip.

       Eric storms in.  He isn't wearing his mask.

                           ERIC
                 [What the fuck is going on!?]

       Zoey notices Eric, she remembers him.

                           OLIVER
                     (pointing at the dead man)
                 [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!]

       Eric looks over at Ricardo and then at the carnage.

       Then everybody notices he isn't wearing a mask.

                           JEAN
                     (quietly)
                 [Eric, your mask.]

                           ERIC
                 Oh shit.

       Then Oliver yanks his off.

                           OLIVER
                 Who gives a damn if they see us or not 
                 anyway!  I can't see a fucking think in 
                 this!

       Everyone takes their masks off.

                           ERIC
                 [Is this what happens?  Is this what 
                 happens when I walk away for five 
                 minutes?]

                           CLAUDE
                 [He had a hidden gun.]

                           ERIC
                     (mimicking a little child)
                 [He had a hidden gun.]
                     (then back to normal)
                 [I don't care!]

       Then, one of the bank customers, a MALE TOURIST, speaks up.

                           MALE TOURIST
                     (holding up his passport)
                 This is insane!  I am a U.S. citizen!  
                 You must let me go!

       Eric looks at him.

                           MALE TOURIST
                 I'm an American!  American!  I'm just 
                 here exchanging dollars.  If it wasn't 
                 for my country you'd all be speaking 
                 German!

       Eric is tired of this outburst, he shoots him.

       Everyone screams.

                           ERIC
                     (to the people)
                 [I have had enough of this nonsense!  The 
                 next person that speaks will die!]

       Everyone is quiet.

       Francois is sitting on the floor bleeding from his arm.

                           JEAN
                 [Eric, I'm sorry.  Things got out of 
                 hand.  But we're in control now.]

                           ERIC
                 [Good.  Let's try to keep it that way.  
                 God what a mess.]

                           CLAUDE
                 Eric

                           ERIC
                 [What the fuck is it now!?  You want me 
                 to hold your hand as you take a piss?]

                           CLAUDE
                 [I have a question.]

                           ERIC
                 [What?]

                           CLAUDE
                 [Do we know if the alarm went off or 
                 not?]

                           ERIC
                 [Yes.]

                           CLAUDE
                 [We do?]

                           ERIC
                 [Yes.  It didn't go off.  If it had the 
                 police would be here and our whole plan 
                 would be fucked.  But they're not here, 
                 and our plan isn't fucked.  So if there 
                 aren't any more fucking stupid questions 
                 I'll go downstairs and see if we're in 
                 yet.  Is that okay with you?]

       Claude nods.

       Then, the phone rings.

       Everyone looks at it.

                           ERIC
                 [I thought the phones were dead.]

       It rings again.

                           OLIVER
                 The phones are dead.

       Eric grabs a WOMAN TELLER who is crying hysterically and 
       lifts her to her feet.

       He drags her to the ringing phone.

                           ERIC
                 [Answer it!]

       She is crying too hard.

       Eric puts his gun to her head.

                           ERIC
                 [Answer it or you will die.]

       She slowly picks up the phone.

                           WOMAN TELLER
                     (answering phone through tears)
                 Banque Internationale de Paris.

       She pauses, then hands the phone to Eric.

                           WOMAN TELLER
                 [It's for you.]

       Eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor.

       He puts the receiver to his ear.

                           ERIC
                     (into phone)
                 [Hello.]
                     (pause)
                 [Who is this?]

       Eric motions to Oliver to check the windows.

       Oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds.

                           OLIVER
                 Oh my God!  The police!

                           ERIC
                     (into phone)
                 [What do you want?]

       Eric looks around at the dead bodies.

                           ERIC
                     (into phone)
                 [We're all fine in here.]

       Oliver is pacing back and forth wildly.  He starts loading 
       extra ammo into his weapon.

                           ERIC
                     (into phone)
                 [No.  I'll tell you what, you go fuck 
                 yourself you fucking pig.  You send 
                 anyone near this building and I'll kill 
                 the first person I lay my hands on.  I've 
                 got plenty hostages here to kill so don't 
                 even think of coming in.]
                     (pause)
                 [Just stay put.  We'll call you when 
                 we're ready.  In the mean time, have a 
                 nice day.]

       Eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook.

                           CLAUDE
                 [The silent alarm must have gone off 
                 after all!]

                           ERIC
                 [Shut the fuck up!  The alarm didn't do 
                 shit.  For all we know your idiot 
                 shooting brought them here.  Anyhow it 
                 doesn't matter.  Nothing has changed.]

                           JEAN
                 [My God!  The police!  What are we going 
                 to do?]

                           ERIC
                 [Nothing.  We don't have to do anything.  
                 The plan stays the same, just slightly 
                 different.]

       Then Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock.  Eric 
       smiles and winks.  Then he turns to Jean with a whisper.

                           ERIC
                 [If the police decide to come in...kill 
                 them.  And if you don't mind, stack those 
                 bodies somewhere else.  This place is a 
                 fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]

       Then he takes off downstairs, smiling.  Jean is a little 
       stumped.

       INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

       As Eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault 
       area a look of intense concentration washes over his face.  
       You can see that a trillion calculations are being made in 
       his brain...the question is:  are there any answers?

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

       Zed is drilling now with a hand drill.  He removes it and 
       blows into the hole.  Shavings come out.

       Eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling.

                           ZED
                     (turning to Eric)
                 What's going on?

                           ERIC
                 Nothing.  They were just scaring them.

                           ZED
                 Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?

                           ERIC
                 Yes.  They're assholes.  Just having fun.

       Zed looks into the hole.

       He has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring.

                           ZED
                 Fucked up my drill bit.

                           ERIC
                 It's okay.  You can buy another one.

       Zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the 
       two prongs into the hole.

                           ZED
                 Cross your fingers.

       Eric does.

       The volt meter's needle jumps.

                           ZED
                 Perfect.

                           ERIC
                 Excellent.  What next?

                           ZED
                 We find the fuse box.  It'll probably be 
                 upstairs.

       Zed gets up.

                           ERIC
                 It's okay.  I'll find it for you.

                           ZED
                 No.  I need to see it myself.

       Zed jumps up and into the storage/elevator area with Eric 
       close behind him.

                           ERIC
                 I think it would be better if I looked 
                 for you.  I could--

       INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

       Instead of walking upstairs, Zed finds the fuse box right in 
       the next room.

                           ZED
                 Hold on.  Here she is.

       Eric is a bit relieved.

       Zed opens it up.

                           ZED
                 Let's see.

       He looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants.

                           ZED
                 Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and 
                 then back on when I call to you.  Any 
                 other switch may set off the alarm.

       Eric smirks.

                           ERIC
                 Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.

                           ZED
                     (serious)
                 Got it?

                           ERIC
                     (nodding)
                 Got it.

       Zed goes back to the vaults.

       INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

       Zed trots back to the Poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a 
       little gizmo from out of his briefcase.  It is a little home-
       made black box with a series of LED's on it and two wires 
       coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end.  
       Three other wires are also coming out of it.

       He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them.

       He then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself.

       The two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt 
       battery.

                           ZED
                 Come on sweetie don't fail me now.

       He looks toward the door leading to the reserve vault area.

                           ZED
                     (calling to Eric)
                 Ready?!

                           ERIC(O.S.)
                     (calling back)
                 Ready!

       Zed turns on his little box, the LED's start flickering.

                           ZED
                 Now!

       The lights go out and then back on.

       There is a whirring sound from the vault door.

       The LED's quickly go from red to green.

       There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks.

                           ZED
                 Open seasame.

       Zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of 
       the Poseidon vault.

       Eric comes running in like a kid on Christmas morning.

                           ERIC
                 It worked!

       He and Zed hug.

                           ERIC
                 Oh my God it worked!

       Zed looks into the Poseidon vault at the passage connecting 
       it to the main vault.  It is covered by a small locked cage.

                           ZED
                 I can get through that lock in a minute.

                           ERIC
                 Then do it.  We don't have all day.

       Zed enters the Poseidon vault.

       INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY

       Zed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a 
       window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get 
       him into the main vault.

       Eric is right behind him.

       Zed takes a twirl at the combination lock.

                           ZED
                 Dime store brand.  Three minutes max.

                           ERIC
                 Good.

       Then, there's a gunshot.  The bullet comes from the Calibre 
       vault through the window and almost hits Zed.

       Zed falls backwards onto the floor.

                           ZED
                 Fuck!

                           ERIC
                 Merde!

       Then there's another gunshot.

       The bullet ricochets through the vault.

                           ZED
                 Jesus Christ!

       Scrambling on their hands and knees Zed and Eric crawl out of 
       the Poseidon vault.

       INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

       They take cover.

       Another shot is fired into the vault.

       Zed and Eric look into the vault.

                           ZED
                 Another security guard?

                           ERIC
                 Must be.

                           ZED
                 I think I stained my pants.

                           ERIC
                 Me too.

       Oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action.

                           OLIVER
                 What is it?!  I came down to see how 
                 things were going and heard shots!

                           ERIC
                 Some asshole in the vault.

       Oliver takes cover and cocks his gun.

                           OLIVER
                 We've got guns.  Why don't we just storm 
                 in and blast his fucking ass!  It's three 
                 against one!  Let's give it the old--

                           ERIC
                 Quiet!

                           OLIVER
                 I'm just trying to be helpful.

                           ERIC
                 Just let me think.

                           OLIVER
                 You don't have to snap at me.

       Eric peeks into the vault.

                           ERIC
                     (calling into the vault)
                 [Hey you.  Nice shooting.  Play time's 
                 over.  Why don't you throw out your gun?]

                           VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
                     (calling from main vault)
                 No!

       Oliver and Eric look at each other and smile.

                           ERIC
                 [Come on.  We don't want to kill you.]

                           VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
                 [You'll have to!]

                           ERIC
                     (quietly to Zed)
                 What is this guys problem?
                     (then to the guard)
                 [Come on!  You're making me impatient.  I 
                 don't have all day.]

                           VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
                 [Look, don't take it personally.  This is 
                 my job.]

       Oliver and Eric look at each other and shrug.  Then Eric sees 
       something in Zed's briefcase.  It looks like grey clay.

                           ERIC
                 [Then take a paid vacation.  We won't 
                 tell if you won't.]

       There is a pause.  During this time Eric takes the clay and 
       pushes a detonator into it.

                           ZED
                     (quietly)
                 What the Hell are you doing?  Have you 
                 gone mad?

                           VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
                 [Sorry.  I can't.]

                           ERIC
                 [Well, look, we're going to give you 
                 fifteen minutes to change your mind.  
                 Okay?]

                           VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
                 [Okay.]

       Zed starts to grab the plastique away from Eric.  Eric 
       resists.

                           ZED
                     (holding his voice down)
                 That's too much.  It's dangerous.

                           ERIC
                 I like danger.
                     (then to the guard)
                 [Changed your mind yet?]

       Eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator.

       Zed and Oliver run for cover.

                           VAULT GUARD #1(O.S.)
                 [No.  And I'm not going to.  Why don't 
                 you just take the money from the other 
                 vaults?--]

       Eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and 
       makes a break for it.

       There is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault.  The 
       walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window, 
       blowing it open.

       The vault guard #1 screams and then goes silent.

       Francois, Claude, and Jean are forcing customers to drag dead

       toward the hall that leads to the stairs.

       The hostages, whose nerves are already shot, start crying.

       Dust has blown out of the vault and is settling on Oliver, 
       Zed, and Eric, who is laughing like a madman.

       Zed is looking at him like he's crazy.

                           ZED
                 You asshole!  You could have killed us 
                 all.

                 But I didn't!  Let's go check out the 
                 damage.

       Eric gets up and walks into the Poseidon vault.

       Before Zed follows him he looks at Oliver who doesn't know 
       what to think.

       INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY

       Eric laughs.

                           ERIC
                 Zed look!

       He points to the caged window.  It's been blown off it's 
       hinges.

                           ERIC
                 I beat you!  I opened it in under three 
                 minutes.

       He starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting 
       passage into the Caliber vault.

       Zed, with his briefcase, follows.

                           ZED
                     (to Oliver)
                 Go around and wait at the main vault 
                 door.  When I tell you, open it up.

                           OLIVER
                 Right.  When you tell me, I'll open it 
                 up.

                           ZED
                 Right.

                           OLIVER
                 Right.

       Zed crawls through the opening.

                           OLIVER
                 I'll be at the other vault waiting for 
                 you to call to me.

       INT. CALIBER VAULT - DAY

       The main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it 
       were blown up from the inside.  On the floor is the still 
       smoldering body of the security guard.  The room is 
       incredibly smokey.

       Zed squeezes through the opening.

       Then, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke 
       with a brick sized bar of pure gold.

                           ERIC
                 Look at it!  We're all rich!

       The smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault 
       there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked 
       onto it.

       Eric starts laughing.

                           ERIC
                 We're rich!

       Zed looks at him like he's crazy.

                           ERIC
                 We're rich!

                           ZED
                 We're not out of here yet.

                           ERIC
                 Yes but we're rich!

       Zed takes a seat at the vault door.  The backside of a vault 
       door looks like an incredibly intricate clock.  Zed removes 
       the Plexiglass shielding.

                           ERIC
                 I'm going to show the others.

       He squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold.

       Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using 
       his voltmeter to test electrical points.

       He looks at it's source, TWO POLICEMEN, decked out in black 
       flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a 
       sewer manhole.

       Eric's eyes widen.  He takes his silencer out of his coat and 
       fixes it to his handgun.  Then, like a man with intent to 
       kill, he rapidly approaches them.

       The one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see 
       Eric fire into his chest.  Then, Eric aims the gun into the 
       tight crawlspace and fires into the other man.  For safe 
       measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway.

       He drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other 
       policeman into it.  He then pushes a large utility wagon over 
       the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in.

       INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY

       Eric comes running out from the reserve vault area and up the 
       stairs to the lobby.

       INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

       Eric rushes into the lobby.

                           ERIC
                 [They want to fuck with me!?  They want 
                 to fuck with me!?]

       He puts the phone on the hook.

       It instantly rings.

       He answers the phone.

                           ERIC
                 [You want to fuck with me!?  I'll show 
                 you what happens to people who fuck with 
                 me!]

       He throws the phone to the ground and looks at Zoey.

                           ERIC
                 [The moment of truth my love.  You knew 
                 it would come.]

       He grabs Zoey and lifts her to her feet.

                           ZOEY
                     (screeching)
                 No!

       Then, the assistant manager stops him.

                           ASSISTANT MANAGER
                 [No!  What ever it is you're going to do 
                 have mercy!]

       Eric suddenly calms down.

                           ERIC
                 [Have mercy?]

                           ASSISTANT MANAGER
                 [Yes.]

                           ERIC
                 [With her.]

                           ASSISTANT MANAGER
                 [Yes.]

                           ERIC
                 [That's sweet.]
                     (to Zoey)
                 [You have quite a reach my lovely.  Is he 
                 one of your clients?]

       He pushes Zoey to the ground.

                           ERIC
                 [It's a deal.]

                           ASSISTANT MANAGER
                 [Thank you.]

                           ERIC
                 [Don't mention it.]

       He grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to 
       the main entrance.

                           CLAUDE
                 [Eric!  What are you doing?]

                           ERIC
                 [Clearing up the "how full of shit am I" 
                 question the cops are asking themselves 
                 right now.]

       The assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but 
       Eric simply forces him along.

       Everyone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire 
       from outside.  They all scream.

       Eric walks back into the bank, he picks up the phone.

                           ERIC
                     (into phone)
                 [Hello.]

                     (then to Claude)
                 [I'm holding.]

       After a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end 
       of the line.

                 [You don't know the fucking half of it.  
                 So just shut the fuck up and listen.  Try 
                 any more stunts and I'll fucking really 
                 go crazy.]
                     (pause)
                 [Well that's good because if you faggot 
                 cops even think of it I'll kill some more 
                 people.  Hear?]
                     (pause)
                 [No.  None of that.  We won't trade.  
                 That never works.  Not in the movies, not 
                 in real life.  Understand?  We're going

       He covers the mouth piece.

       INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY

       Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door.  He 
       glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a 
       calculator.

       Then, there is a groaning sound.

       Zed, terrified, spins around.

       Another groaning sound.  The vault security guard isn't dead.  
       His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much 
       alive.

                           VAULT GUARD #1
                 [I'm going to die...]

       Zed can't believe what he's seeing.

       He moves over to the body, leaving his work behind.

                           VAULT GUARD #1
                 [I'm going to die...please hold 
                 my...hand.  I don't...want to 
                 die...alone.]

       Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it.  He gives it a 
       nudge with his foot.

       The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever.

       Zed kneels down next to the body.

                           ZED
                 Are you still there?

       Nothing.

       Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and 
       checks for a pulse.

       Nothing.

       Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like 
       he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he 
       scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches.  
       He has wired a battery to two leads.  He takes out a wire 
       cutter and snips a wire.

       There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as 
       the vault unlocks.

       Zed calls to Oliver from the passage.

       INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

       Oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub 
       lobby teller.

                           ZED(O.S.)
                     (distant, calling from the 
                      vault)
                 Oliver, now!  Open the vault!

       Oliver turns the large wheel and opens the Caliber vault 
       door.

       With some amount of energy the door opens.  Standing inside 
       is Zed.

                           ZED
                 Open seasame.

       He steps out of the vault.

                           ZED
                 Do you want to give me a hand?

                           OLIVER
                 Sure.

       Oliver puts his gun down and they go into the Calibre vault.

       INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY

       Oliver sees the huge platen of gold bricks.  Zed puts his 
       steel briefcase on top of it.

                           OLIVER
                 Holy mother.

       phone from the wall.

                           ERIC
                 Merde!

       He grabs his machine gun and aims it at the sub lobby guard 
       #2.

       The sub lobby guard #2 braces himself for gunfire.

       Eric fires into him.  He is dead instantly.

       Everybody screams.

       Eric fires into his dead corpse until his gun runs out of 
       bullets.

                           ERIC
                 [That's what you get!]

       Claude puts his hand on Eric's shoulder.

                           CLAUDE
                 Eric.

       Eric looks at him.

                 [The fucking police won't budge.  I kill

                           CLAUDE
                 [And what if we gave up?]

       Eric can't believe this.

                     (laughing)

       Then he looks at Zoey.

                 [What are you looking at you fucking

       She doesn't want to say a thing that'll upset him.

                 [Are you afraid I'll tell these people

       She shakes her head "no".

                 [What?  So they know that you're a--]

       The sub lobby assistant speaks up.

                           SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT
                 [Leave her alone.]

       Eric cracks the butt of his gun into the man's face.

                           ERIC
                 [Shut up!]

       He clicks another clip into the Uzi and grabs Zoey by the 
       collar and lifts her to her feet.

       They get into the banks private freight elevator.

       Eric is dragging Zoey by the hair toward the door when she 
       grabs his groin and starts squeezing.

       Eric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the Uzi 
       into her face.

       But she won't let go.  Her years as a prostitute have taught 
       her to ignore pain.

       She grabs hold of the gun hand.

       A few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's 
       foot red.

       Eric lets go and falls to the ground.

       Claude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to 
       what's going on.

       Zoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it.  She showers 
       the room with bullets.  She starts to run toward the back 
       office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude, 
       Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages.

       Then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and 
       start clouding the place up.

       Eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red

       The elevator doors open onto the ground floor to the sound of 
       automatic gunfire.  Zed walks out into the back office.

       INT. BANK - BACK OFFICE - DAY

       Suddenly, from the back office, Zed sees Zoey blasting away 
       an Uzi and running toward the rear stairwell.  Eric is in the 
       lobby limping around.  The other gang members are ducking 
       from her fire.

       Then, her clip runs out.

       She sees Zed, their eyes lock.  An IMAGE overcomes Zed.  She 
       runs down the stairs to the back.

                           ERIC
                 Kill her!  Kill her!

       Oliver aims his gun to fire and Zed pushes it up.  Oliver's 
       gun discharges into the ceiling.  Oliver and Zed begin to 
       struggle.

       INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

       Zed and Oliver collapse out of the back office and into the 
       lobby.  They tumble onto the floor.  Eric hobbles over to 
       them, his gun aimed at Zed.

       Zoe is near tears.  She drops the empty machine gun to the 
       floor and starts walking toward the sub lobby.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

       Eric leans down to talk to Zed.  Oliver and Jean are 
       watching.  Francois and Claude are more worried about the 
       tear gas.

                           CLAUDE
                 [They're trying to smoke us out Eric!]

                           FRANCOIS
                 [What do we do!?]

       Eric waves them off with a brush of his hand.  He's 
       concentrating on Zed.

                           ERIC
                 Do you really love your bitch whore 
                 girlfriend that much?  She's really 
                 fucked with your mind.

                           ZED
                 Eric...what are you talking about?

       Eric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the 
       knife.  He turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his 
       ear.

                           ERIC
                 Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke.  
                 The attention.  They have no idea of who 
                 they're dealing with.  They have no idea 
                 what kind of men we are.

                           ZED
                     (thinking Eric is a madman)
                 What kind of men are we?

       Eric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek.

                           ERIC
                 You can no longer be in our club.  You 
                 forfeit your cut of the pie.

       Zed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat.

                           ZED
                 What about our friendship?

                           ERIC
                 Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years.  
                 You hardly know me.

       He slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade.  Zed 
       falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll.

                           ERIC
                 Never let a girl come between two men.

       He walks down the hall toward the gold.

                           ERIC
                 Now let's try to get out of here.

       Eric walks into the back office.  The others look at each 
       other.

       Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the 
       shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires.

       In the background the distinctive sound of European police 
       sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank.

       Also, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a 
       bullhorn.

                           FRANCOIS
                 [The police!  They're entering the 
                 building!]

       Suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the 
       smoke.

       Francois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator 
       via the back office.

       INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

       Eric caresses his hand across the bars of gold.

                           ERIC
                     (to himself)
                 [Smoother and more giving than the most 
                 selfless human being.  You're beautiful.]

       Francois runs in.

                           FRANCOIS
                 [Eric!]

                           ERIC

       Jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke 
       and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud.

       Then he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his 
       head.

                           JEAN
                 [Don't make me!]

       A single bullet passes through his torso.  As Jean falls to 
       the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling.

       Oliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man.

       From behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold 
       of Claude and wrestles him to the ground.

       The other customers start to flee for cover.

       Oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and 
       Claude.  It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the 
       upper hand.  Oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine 
       gun fire at them...killing them both.

       Zoe walks up the stairs out, not only are they locked but a 
       cloud of tear gas is pouring into the downstairs sub lobby.

       Suddenly, Zed stumbles in.

       Zed is like a zombie.  Then he notices Zoe in the stairwell.  
       They lock eyes.

                           ZED
                     (almost delerious)
                 Zoe...

       She steps down into the sub lobby, machine guns crackle in 
       the background.  She runs up to him just as he slumps to the 
       ground.

                           ZOE
                     (holding him)
                 My Zed.  They've hurt you.

       She dabs a cloth to his cut face.  He holds it on.

                           ZOE
                     (trying to comfort him)
                 You're going to be okay.  In many 
                 countries scars on the face are a symbol 
                 of heroism.  To proudly display a flaw 
                 like a badge...is to wear a badge of 
                 truth.

       He takes her hand.

                           ZED
                 Be serious Zoe...I can stick my tongue 
                 through my cheek.

       The police are now laying it on heavy.  Francois comes out of 
       the office.

                 Oliver!  Let's get a hostage!

                           OLIVER

       Francois is ripped into by machine gun fire.

       Oliver races past him.

       Tear gas is starting to fill the room.

       Zoe stands Zed up.

                           ZOE
                 Listen to me.  We're going to lock 
                 ourselves into one of the air tight 
                 vaults...if any of them are still open.

       They start walking toward the reserve vault area.

       Eric hops into the elevator and closes the door, just as 
       Oliver runs up, firing toward the police.

       Eric is laughing manically as he leaves them behind.

                           OLIVER
                 Bastard!

       Oliver turns to where the police will surely be coming in.

       Zoey and Zed rush into the reserve vault area.  Zoey notices 
       that the downstairs reserve vault is closed.

                           ZOE
                 Merde!  The vault has been closed.

                           ZED
                 What about the others?

       The gunfire upstairs has subsided and has been replaced by 
       unintelligible POLICE VOICES.

                           ZOE
                 Listen...there's no gunfire.

       Zoey quietly opens the door opposite the vault that leads to 
       the rear stairs to the lobby level.

       INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY

       Zoey peeks up the stairs just in time to see Oliver bolt for 
       the stairs.

                           OLIVER
                     (to police)
                 Motherfuckers!

       A volly of gunfire rips into Oliver but he stands his ground 
       and fires into the police.

                           OLIVER
                 You wanna fuck with me?  You wanna fuck 
                 with me?  I'll show you who you're 
                 fucking with!

       He starts blasting away.

       Terrified, Zoey leads Zed to the storage/elevator area.

                           ZOEY
                 C'mon, we'll be safer in here.

       The elevator door opens, Eric steps out and looks around like 
       a caged animal.

                           ERIC
                 [Think!]

       Then, Zed and Zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault 
       area.

       Eric turns to them with his gun raised, when he sees them he 
       lowers it.

                           ERIC
                 Zed.

       They all stand there for a moment, the gunfire cracking away 
       upstairs.  Eric is more casual than he should be.

                           ERIC
                     (matter-of-factly)
                 What's your girlfriends name?

                           ZED
                 Zoe.

                           ERIC
                 Zoe.
                     (to Zoey in French)
                 [Zoe, come here to me.]

       Zoey spits at him.

       Eric laughs and aims the gun at her.

                           ERIC
                 [Killing you would just be gravy, so 
                 don't fuck with me.]

                           ZOEY
                 [Go ahead you slob.  Shave my ass!]

       Eric smashes the side of her face with the gun and then grabs 
       a hold of her arm.

       Zed tries to stop Eric but Eric aims the gun at him.

                           ERIC
                 Zed no.  I'll kill you.  It means nothing 
                 to me, our friendship.

                           ZED
                     (starting out calm and then 
                      building to a scream)
                 Eric...there's no fucking way out of 
                 here!

                           ERIC
                 Oh but you're wrong.  This is my way out.  
                 This dime store couge with her motor 
                 driven ass.  You find your own.

       Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching.  Eric drops the 
       gun but quickly whips out his knife.

       She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her 
       shirt.

       Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back.

       Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back.

       Zoey falls to the floor.

                           ERIC
                 Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a 
                 sausage.

       Zed is standing between Zoey and Eric.

                           ZED
                 Zoey, get out of here!

       She scrambles away.

       He swipes at Zed.

       Zed jumps back down the hall toward the reserve vault area.

       INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA- DAY

       They rush out toward the stairs.

                           ERIC
                 Did you see how she ran?  Did you see how 
                 she ran?  She doesn't care about you.  
                 Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.  
                 Look out for number one.  What do you say 
                 Zed?

       He swipes again.

                           ERIC
                 I will kill you.  And once I kill you 
                 Zed, I'll get out of here.  I'll fuck 
                 your bitch up the ass and give her 
                 AIDS...if she doesn't already have it.  
                 What do you say to that Zed?

       He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade.

       Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor.

       Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face.

       Eric reaches for the knife.

       Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric.

       Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair.  
       She plunges her nails into his face.

                           ERIC
                 Fucking bitch!

       Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath.

       Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes.

       Zed lets out a shrill scream.

       Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face.

       The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like 
       worms, unable to move because each is putting the other 
       through such agony.

       Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the 
       room.  His body is a mass of bullet wounds.

                           OLIVER
                 Ox!  Where is thy yoke!?

       He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near 
       Zoey, Zed, and Eric.

       The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman 
       could posses.  He rolls over and throws Zoey off him.

       Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it.

       Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun.

       He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.

                           ERIC
                 Fuck both of you.

       Then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs.

       Eric turns back to them.

                           ERIC
                 Au revoir.

       He aims to kill Zed.

                           ZOEY
                 No!

       Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their 
       assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs.  
       At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their 
       guns.

                           FRENCH POLICEMAN #1
                 [Stop!]

       Eric stops.

       It becomes quiet.

       Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun 
       kick.

                           ERIC
                 I give you little kiss.  Ciao.

       He squeezes the trigger and...

       CLICK

       The police open fire with their French made assault machine 
       guns and fill Eric with bullets.  Instead of falling he does 
       a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red.

       The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed.

       An IMAGE overcomes Eric.

       Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of 
       Zed.

       Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey.

       Zoey runs up to him and holds him.

       The police all charge into the secondary vault area and 
       secure the downstairs.

       Zoey is crying as she holds Zed.

       The police have their guns aimed at the two of them.

       Zoey looks up.

                           ZOEY
                     (to the policemen)
                 [I work here.  This man is a 
                 customer...he needs medical help.]

       They take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if 
       he's okay.

                           FRENCH POLICEMAN #2
                 [How bad do you think his wounds are?]

       The other policeman, unable to tell because of Eric's blood, 
       simply shakes his head.

                           FRENCH POLICEMAN #1
                     (to Zoey)
                 [Are you alright?]

       Zoey starts to cry.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

       INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

       Zoey and Zed, bandaged up, are being aided by all of the 
       French policemen as they walk through the bank.

       Smoke is still clearing, but the bodies of customers and bank 
       robbers alike litter the area.

       PARAMEDIC's, wearing all white, try to help the injured, they 
       assist Zed and Zoey.

                           FRENCH POLICEMAN #1
                     (to Zoey and Zed)
                 [There's an ambulance outside.]
                     (he looks around)
                 [My God.  What a Bastille Day.]

       Zed's attention is caught by two OTHER POLICEMEN carrying a 
       body bag.

                           FRENCH POLICEMAN #3
                     (to French policeman #1)
                 [This one's the ringmaster.  We need an 
                 I.D.]

       No longer interested in Zoey or Zed, he goes to check out the 
       body.

                           ZOEY
                 The hospital?

                           ZED
                 No.

                           ZOEY
                 Come on.  I have a car.

       Zoey puts her arm around Zed and helps him out of the 
       bank...never to return.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

       INT. ZOEY'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

       Zoey is driving.  Zed looks like he's been in a burning 
       building.

                           ZED
                 I'm so tired.

                           ZOEY
                 We'll go to my flat.  You can rest there.  
                 Do you feel pain?

                           ZED
                 No...it was mostly his blood.

                           ZOEY
                 I have a shower.  You can clean up there.

                           ZED
                 Thank you Zoe.

       He looks at her.

                           ZOEY
                 My name is not Zoe.  Not any more.

       He looks forward at the streets of Paris.

                           ZOEY
                 You'll get well.  Then I'll show you the 
                 real Paris.

       They drive away.

       

                          THE END
